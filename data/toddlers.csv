I’ve been trying to potty train my daughter, but whenever I put her on the potty she will hold everything in and cry and as soon I put her pull-up back on, she does her business. 

I’ve tried the schedule method, where you assign certain times to go to the potty, the “naked” method, where you don’t put any diaper/pull-up on, and I’ve tried taking her to the potty every time I have to use the restroom, but nothing seems to work.

This has been happening consistently for about a month.

I try him on the potty before. He will poop in the potty if he has to go when he's on it, unless it's before nap. I'm pretty sure he's holding it in on purpose.

I've tried changing the timing of lunch and of the nap. He responds by changing the timing of his poop.

He will not sleep with a poop in his pants, which is good. I wouldn't either. I think he's using his poops to manipulate us into visiting him during his nap time/quiet time and I want it to stop. But I can't stop cleaning his diaper. 

I keep the visits short, quiet and boring. I give him a lot of attention so it's not like it's the only interaction he gets. I've also tried winding down the attention before the nap.

I've tried faking him out and putting him in his room earlier, but he won't poop until it's his real nap time.

As soon as the poop is cleaned he goes down for a nap without complaint. It's not that big of a deal except I have another baby to deal with and chores to complete, and honestly just need a break from his energy. It really is just an inconvenience or an annoyance, and not a big problem, but one I'd like solved nonetheless. It definitely impacts the time he spends sleeping.

It doesn't happen for night sleep, only for his nap.

This weekend I had to return home and the trip was less successful. Large sections of it were such a disaster that I think it's worth recording.

**Breaks in the Journey**

On the way out we were blessed with good weather and could stop in open areas so our child could run around. On the way back it was cold and rainy with strong winds.

Tip: Plan for how to burn energy when your child can't go outside. The only opportunity I had was getting him to go up and down five flights of stairs at the hotel over and over again until he was tired.

**Plan for illness**

Our child came down with a cold on the evening of day 1. Come up with a strategy for how one of you will get enough sleep to be safe to drive the following day when your child is waking up every hour.

**The great tablet debate**

Day 1 - tablet is for emergencies

Day 2 - Tablet can be considered

Day 2 - Last two hours of driving - give him the tablet and do whatever is necessary to keep him entertained. I don't care anymore

**Entertainment**

Learn to hide the weariness in your tone as you read the Gruffalo for the tenth time in a row. Do not suggest that maybe we try a different book as that will lead to screaming.

**Conclusion**

Driving is easy if the weather is nice and you can stop and get them out for an hour of exercise. It's very hard if your child is not napping due to lack of exercise.

We live with my parents for the time being and my mom is a total narcissist. She inserts herself all the time when we’re disciplining our kid and takes it personally when we don’t do things the way she did (read: authoritative with no empathy). My least favorite thing is that she and now my husband threatens to take away his tablet for everything. Had an accident in your pants? No tablet the rest of the day. Won’t finish your dinner? No tablet. You were rude and disrespectful? No tablet for a week. 

It’s the dumbest punishment ever because she always caves in and gives it back early when she gets annoyed of his 4 year old energy. It’s also placed this emphasis on the tablet as this forbidden fruit. He doesn’t understand the idea of natural consequences because everything is about his tablet.

Tonight, I offered him a choice: should I put him to bed or his baby brother. He wanted to watch an episode of blippi, so he said for me to put baby to sleep. Okay, daddy will tuck him in then. After the video was over, he said nvm mom I changed my mind. I want you now. I said no, because I’ve been trying to teach him that making rash choices have consequences. Cue 20 minute meltdown with him begging me to let him change his mind. Husband started losing his temper and said if he keeps crying, he loses his tablet for a week. I’m like wtf does the tablet have to do with this situation? He wasn’t even watching the tablet in the first place! Then my mom comes creeping in the room. Once she hears why he’s crying, she’s also jumping in with “baby, don’t you want your tablet back in the morning? If so, then stop crying.” OMG ENOUGH WITH THE TABLET ALREADY. 

I want to just take the tablet and hide it forever. But then they’re just offering him their phones when it’s time to eat or he needs to poop, because they’ve trained for him to do that too.

I had to hear backhanded comments about how I’m “getting there” and “I’ll get there someday” even though I have my own apartment I’m actually very content with. Lol that I was able to shrug off. The most annoying part was that my sister knew my toddler was coming over but there were skateboards and boxes and styrofoam (all things that attract toddlers) also a huge new $1,000 flat screen my toddler could easily reach. The entire night all I heard was myself and my family “don’t touch that! Don’t touch this! Don’t go there! Stop!” Over and over. Their apartment was nice and I appreciate them inviting us over but after an hour there I wished they hadn’t. My toddler of course started throwing a fit because she was just being bossed around by everyone and kept being told not to touch everything. (She couldn’t play with the styrofoam because it might get everywhere, she couldn’t play with the little pumpkins because “she might break them”) I had anxiety the entire time trying to stop her from touching their items. On top of that they kept telling her to shush and quiet down because my toddler loves to scream. They kept bragging about their apartment but all it made me do was appreciative of my apartment, although it’s smaller my toddler can run around and be as loud as she wants. Obviously they don’t have kids so of course their apartment wouldn’t be child proof! I’m not mad at them for wanting to keep their apartment nice I’m just ranting because by the end of the night my toddler was so upset she began to do her usual hitting, where she slaps the shit out of me. Of course this behavior shocked my family (my family who never asks about her or sees her) and they once again began making comments. My sister came over and said “omg why is she acting like that” and I angrily snapped back “because she’s 2. She’s a toddler” ... it’s difficult bringing my toddler anywhere but I think that apartment takes the cake. I should’ve planned better and brought her a toy. I couldn’t sit down to eat anything, I don’t think I was able to sit down for longer than 30 seconds. Just not a fun time. I was a stay at home mom for two years, now I work a 9-5 and I would probably break down and cry if I had to go back to being a sahm. Their just so much work. Sorry for the rant.

Both girls! 

His family is super 'huggy and kissy' and mine isn't. I feel like somewhere in between is where id like to be as a parent as I do not enjoy kissing and hugging my MIL and FIL every damn time I walk out of the house. Maybe I'm just a cold bitch but whatever 🤣 

Our oldest daughter (2) is a super lovey girl! She loves kisses and hugs and will wave at anyone, blow kisses and say hi when they walk by no matter who they are. It is adorable and I love it but I know it will mean boundaries in the future. I had a rough time as a teen and my boundaries were crossed many times assault/rape by a previous significant other that I have only recently come to terms with and recognized almost 15 years later. It breaks my heart that this might someday happen to my girls and I want to do everything in my power to make sure they feel comfortable and confident with saying no. 

Now cue my partner and his overbearing family... They come in the door and demand a kiss and hug, even if my toddler turns away from them they follow her and say ""where's granny's kiss?? Where's my hug??"" And laugh when she turns away then they scoop her up and she usually complies. She seems happy but it still bothers me. I always ask her if she wants a hug or a kiss and if she doesn't I don't force it. I usually just blow her a kiss or wave goodnight and then she decides she wants to give me one. 

My partner 'struggle snuggles' her... He scoops her up and squeezes her and forces her to cuddle with him on the couch and says things like ""nope your not going nowhere daddy wants his snuggles"" and she usually is squirming/yelling and trying to get away. I explained to him that it's important to give her the choice of affection and if he doesn't respect her choices that she may think it's ok for other adults to do whatever they want with her and she just has to put up with it. (I think this is an awful message to send to her) and he says it's different because he's her dad. Or different because it's grandma and grandpa. 

I think that even though it's family, it still matters and it makes me have this alarming anxious feeling everytime I hear them ""where's my hug/kiss??"" It just upsets me and I need it to stop. 

Because my SO is being such a jerk about it and my MIL/FIL are the same and think I wasn't loved as a child because I'm not super huggy or cuddly/kissy I need to go about this in a way that seems not about my preferences but 100% about her bodily autonomy which is what takes priority here. I need to see them respect her.

From the moment she came out of the womb, she has wanted her eyes to stay open. I have tried every trick in the book and she just refuses. Naps have been non-existent for her for about a year now, and she still fights bedtime more than any kid I've met - and I use to nanny.

A typical night goes like: try to put her to bed, have to hold her hand while she lays in her bed and screams and eventually falls asleep (takes about an hour or longer), then she wakes up two-four hours later screaming to come into our bed, then she wakes about three hours later to either kick us or to scream at the top of her lungs or demand we all wake up. Then she falls back asleep and wakes up about two hours later and is up for the day.

This is incredibly exhausting for all of us, but like I said, I have tried everything I can think of and more.

We have black out curtains on her window, we play white noise (the falling asleep part takes longer for her if we don't), we make sure her room is a good temperature, we have a consistent bedtime and bedtime routine, she wakes herself up at the same time every day -- I just don't know what else we can do. I've even started giving her little melatonin gummies (0.5mg) just before bed and while it makes her go to sleep easier, she is still waking up loads of times throughout the night.

At this point I wonder if she has a sleep disorder or something because it seems like no matter what we do, she will not sleep.

I have a 16 month old who recently returned to daycare (back for 3 weeks now), he's loving it there and he's thriving while there. I know it's normal for them to suddenly turn clingy and whiney and throw tantrums the moment they come back from daycare because they've been holding it together all day. We've been implementing some quiet and 1:1 time with him right when he gets home before we get started with dinner, bath, etc. 

It's working well so far to curb the freak outs at the beginning of the night. The problem starts when we get going with the routine and try to move to dinner time.

 New this past week is he doesn't want to get into his high chair, is wanting to climb all over us and is so goddamn wiggly and only wants to sit in our lap. I know he's hungry because he wants to to grab the food and eat, but if we put him in his high chair, HE.FREAKS.THE.FUCK.OUT. we put him down and HE.FREAKS.THE.FUCK.OUT. The freaking the fuck out and whiney screamy crying lasts all the way through bath time and getting into his pajamas (right after dinner). He calms down right after that. He's fine eating in his high chair at breakfast and he goes in happily.

He always did a great job and was a great listener until the terrible twos hit. Now it’s impossible. He literally laughs in your face and will continue to do whatever he’s doing to test you and laughs the whole time, which as I’m sure you can imagine, gets incredibly frustrating.

My husband works from home but only helps when it’s convenient for him aka whenever he feels like it. He has time to do what he wants but can only help when it suits him. That’s a whole other thing and I’m just generally frustrated right now. My husband has been working at the kitchen table all morning and the house is an open floor plan in the front meaning the kitchen, dining room, and living room are essentially one giant room. 

Anyway, for an example. My son and I were playing with playdoh and had moved from the kitchen table to the coffee table in the living room. He had started playing by himself and going between his tablet (which was on the couch) and the play doh so I backed off and sat down right behind him and started playing Animal Crossing but was still interacting with him here and there. The coffee table had a bunch of his other toys on there and he shoved an armful off to make room. This has been an ongoing issue (him basically bulldozing all his toys off the table to make room) and we have tried correcting it with no success. I raised my voice and sternly told him we do NOT treat our toys this way and asked him to pick them up, which as usual was ignored. I didn’t immediately jump to start picking them up myself and trying to get him to help me because that doesn’t work either. My son then started “testing his boundaries” by acting like he was going to swipe more toys off the table and grinning at me, waiting for a reaction. I chose not to react and ignore him because reacting doesn’t work. He did it anyway. I ignored the second time, but the third time when he dumped a whole container of expensive Brio toys I got pissed. I raised my voice again and told him we don’t throw our toys, picked up all the Brio stuff and put it away. I’ve tried telling him if he can’t treat his stuff nice he can’t play with it, but that doesn’t seem to work either. While cleaning it up I tried sitting him on the couch for a time out which he also thought was a game and kept laughing trying to get up. By now I’m extremely frustrated so I grabbed his arms and sat him back down and held his arms so he couldn’t get back up, got to his level, and sternly told him I had enough and he needed to stop and start listening to mommy.
My husband then decided this was a good time to intervene and started asking if I needed a break and said something about putting our son in his crib for a time out. I snapped at him and said that we can’t put him in his crib for a time out because he we can’t associate that negatively or it’ll be a disaster.
My husband then sat down and tried asking him why he’s not listening to mommy and he has to be nice and whatever which gets frustrating because 1) he’s asking him stuff that my son can’t answer because he doesn’t understand and 2) talking nice to him isn’t working. being reasonable isn’t working, we’ve tried that for months now.

I get toddlers are toddlers and aren’t going to listen and times are going to be tough but I can’t continue just “trying to be reasonable” because it’s not working and I’m not going to have a toddler running my household. I’m not a fan of spanking but this is the second time I’ve been very close to spanking him. 

One of the main issues I have is that my son smiles and laughs at any attempt to discipline him. He thinks it’s funny and will keep trying to do whatever it is he’s not supposed to be doing. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’m a SAHM so my job literally all day (besides college, I’m a full time student which I do at night) is to play with my kid. He gets plenty of attention between me and my husband both being home, plus my dad and brother are currently staying with us while they get adjusted to the new city they moved to and find work/a place to stay. He gets plenty of attention.

I’m at a loss. The only time disciplining him seemed to work was the one time I got down at his level and really yelled at him, which I’ve done once but then I feel horrible about making him cry because that’s not the type of parent I want to be. He did listen and we didn’t have any more issues, but again...it’s like is this really what it takes to get him to listen?

She’s 14 months old, so the first lockdown was manageable as she wasn’t super interested in other babies then. But now she’s at the age where she’ll need to start developing those social skills. I feel like we’re in a tough spot. Pre-pandemic my partner would take her to mom and baby gatherings at the library or meet up with some friends of ours who also had little ones.

Not only does she eat very quickly and stuffs her mouth when eating, despite constant redirection and reminders not to (which could be considered fairly normal toddler behavior), but more worryingly, she associates food/hunger with any strong emotion she has, specifically if she is bored or upset but also if she is happy. She is comforted by food and highly enthusiastic about it. 

She has had meltdowns over food and cannot stop herself from asking repeatedly for food whenever she goes to someone’s house, including having meltdowns over food at other peoples houses when we intervene. Because others don’t understand the extent of her food obsession she is often offered food we would prefer she doesn’t have (candy, junky snacks) because other kids are eating it and our concerns are brushed off by other parents as silly and overbearing. For example, recently, we gave her a fruit for snack before arriving somewhere and then she was offered cookies by our host - it is difficult to say no when everyone else has cookies and we look like monster parents for not allowing her to partake( we do allow her a small portion in those instances but afterward she obsessed over it and asks for cookies repeatedly when feeling emotional). 

We are doing our best to model eating slowly and naming her emotions when she claims to be hungry and is clearly upset/bored/etc. We have found that saying yes to something sometimes decreases her interest in it, even so that she sometimes forgets asking for it, but it has not resolved her behavior by any means. If we gave her all the food she asked for she would be highly obese. She still says she is hungry and cries for food on average 3-4 times between meals and asks for food immediately upon waking. She is not fat per se (she looks normal and takes the appropriate size clothing for her age -3T - but her BMI is elevated at approx 18%) as we only give her healthy foods and highly limit her snacking options, so even though we have addressed the problem with her doctor, he was not particularly worried. 

We also noticed that when she was home from school (where food is provided) during quarantine, her weight for her height became normal, and when she returned to school she gained weight again to go back into the “overweight” BMI category. 

More concerning however is her obsessive behavior around food. Any strategies for helping her become less obsessed would be appreciated.

Between my husband traveling for work and COVID I’ve been a full time stay at home mom with zero breaks for like.. 8 months. I love my son so much but he is very active and doesn’t nap anymore and is, of course, a toddler. He’s 2.5. Very strong willed and quick to tantrum. The past month he’s started hitting and kicking me. I have to be honest it makes me feel shitty. I try to be a good parent and we go for lots of walks, hikes, play in the backyard, I play games and puzzles with him, read to him every day, and try to help him feel like he gets to make his own decisions by giving him lots of choices/freedom. He always has tasty healthy food and I keep the house pretty tidy. I try to create a happy environment where we sing and dance and smile a lot. But lately the instant I’m firm about a boundary (which I always give a warning first) he lashes out at me and screams “hit!” Or “kick!” While hitting or kicking me. I’ve gotten good at dodging or gently restraining him. I’ve tried ignoring, validating, and explaining other ways to express “big feelings” but he is attempting to hit/kick me like 10x per day now. 

I had to carry our monthly dog food subscription down to the basement so I did just that, except my toddler started following me down the stairs. Our basement isn’t finished or anything and toddler was in the middle of lunch so I explained that we were going upstairs and he tried to hit me. I carried him upstairs kicking and screaming and put him down. He sulked so I asked if he would like a hug and he wound up and hit me right in the eye. I wasn’t expecting it and I just immediately slapped him in the face. I don’t even know how it happened. I didn’t make a conscious decision I just lost it. It wasn’t super hard but it was hard enough to make a noise and he immediately looked surprised. I feel horrible, like I broke his trust and he’s never going to feel comfortable with me again. I apologized to him a lot and have been reading him his favorite books and giving him lots of snuggles and kisses.

How wrong I was. He finally fell asleep just before midnight.

Okay cool, I assumed that was our green light. It's now October, decided to go with it. I find a place with good reviews and takes our insurance, and try and set something up. But they need a formal referral from the pediatrician. Thats fine, I call his Dr back, and the girl looks at his chart, mentions that the Dr had made a note that she told me to go to a specialist, but says she will have to get formal authorization from the Dr before she can actually send something to the therapy place, but that I might have to come back in for an appointment to get the actual referral. 

At this point I'm confused but whatever, they're going to talk to her and call me back. That was a week and half ago. I've called 3 times, to check in, and everytime they say the Dr hasn't checked her messages yet. But....they are all in the same freaking office together. The therapy place I called had limited spots available, so I'm anxious to get this started. Had I known this was going to be dragged out I would have started the process weeks ago, but based off what the Dr told me in person, she never indicated needing to come back. I just feel like I'm getting the run around at this point. 

Im trying to keep my cool, and not burn bridges, and drag this out even longer. But every time I talk to the girl that organizes referrals, she sounds completely annoyed with me, and I feel like I'm just trying to advocate for my kid and get shit done.

My 3-year-old (June bday) son always seems to keep trying new things with his toys until they are eventually broken. All of them. We have tried a lot of different things and can’t really decide what the best course of action is.

For example, for his birthday he got a cool new robot. It is really durable, rated for ages 3+ with activities very much appropriate for my son’s age level. We worked with him a lot at first on how to enjoy the various things the robot could do and he took very good care of it for several months. Then he got bored. I’m sure you can relate.

Now at this point is when I try to stash toys for awhile and then bring them out later for renewed interest. But the robot was special and my son wanted to know where he was, so we got him back out. That’s when the experiments began. The robot shoots discs - will he shoot string cheese? Can he roll in the grass? Should we stuff things in his mouth to see if they fit? We explained all along the way that the robot was not made to do those things. We do stick to an indoor-toy and outdoor-toy system, but the robot would sneak outside or into bed or whatever. Eventually the robot broke and now will only give an error message when he turns on.

My son is confused. Although many toys have broken (and we thank those toys and throw them away), he still does this with each new toy and then is horribly disappointed that they break. And also, I don’t want to buy anymore robots! 

So, do we refuse to buy another robot until he is older? And when should we try again? Do we take toys away when he can’t play nicely, teaching him those rules, or do we let him learn from his own mistakes by letting him keep breaking the toys? What do you do/have you done?

* **nap 2 around 3:30pm (1 to 2 hours)**

His current bedtime routine is bedtime stories / winding with his favorite blanket with the lights low, once he starts to get sleepy we'll put him in his crib and he falls asleep almost always immediately.

Then around 2 to 3 hours later he'll wake up crying, want to be picked up / soothed (or sometimes try and nurse if he's very upset) and then go back to sleep. This continues through the entire night every 2 hours (Some nights every hour which are horrible sleep deprived nights for mom and dad) until his wake time.

We've tried different nap schedules, 1 nap days, different bedtime routines and different approaches to handling him when he cries at night.

So we’re just using the tactics and worksheets our older son used at his age.

(And honestly I don't know why I didn't know about this place before. I guess it's hard to believe my kid is growing up!)

Anyways, I'm looking for advice on potty regressions. My daughter is almost 4. Other than at night, she has essentially been potty trained for about a year. We had one regression this past spring with full blown pee accidents and slight pee accidents (enough to get her underwear and pants wet but not enough to have a puddle on the floor). However, I can sort of understand that regression because the changes covid brought as well as a new brother in the house.

Now, for the past 2-3 weeks she has been having a lot of both poop and pee accidents. Especially this last week she has had multiple accidents in a day. We have implemented a ""no snack"" in the evening rule when she has the first accident and more recently a ""no evening TV time"" when she has a second accident in the day. When it has been poop accidents I started having her clean out her underwear but that didn't phase her. The last poop accident I was fed up and just threw her underwear out. She wasn't happy about that but I still don't know if that will phase her. I've tried talking to her about it and asking her why she is having accidents and the best I get is ""I don't know."" The really frustrating thing is when I think I see her doing the potty dance and I ask her if she needs to go. She says no and I leave it because I couldn't be sure if it was the potty dance. And then within the minute she has an accident. 

I'm trying to think if there is any big changes but nothing comes to mind. Her new brother is almost 8 months old. But I am wondering if this could be an attention thing revolving around him. Also, she started pre-K at the beginning of August. It is at the same daycare/school she has been at all along and the accidents didn't start until at least 1.5 months after she started her new class. So I can't imagine it having to do with her school. And she hasn't been having accidents while at school, but I'm honestly not sure if they have a potty schedule still or not. If not then essentially she is purposefully only having accidents when she is not at school.

Quick question.

I have a 22 month old and a 5 week old.  My 22 mo weaned herself off of soothers when she was 6 months old. Never really cared for them. 

Now that we have this new baby, she has been relatively good about the whole thing. I knew she would regress in one form or another.  She doesn’t talk yet (whole other battle) and this passed week she has been obsessed with her little sister’s pacifiers.  Mostly when we are just in the house.  When we are out and about she doesn’t seem to notice.

This is becoming a pain because she will constantly try to steal the baby’s, even when she has one in her mouth already.  If we take any soothers away she will lose her noodle.  

I’m scared her teeth will get bent out of joint or she will be hooked on these suckers.  Any advice? Just wait it out? I do my very best to balance both of the girls and she gets a lot of our attention.

Please forgive some of the stupid questions.
3.5 is my buddy and we've had a great bond from day one, but I'm not quite as close with the 14 mo. Feeling guilty about that and also 3.5 is used to having my undivided attention when I visit but now that they're with me all the time  both are super needy and I don't feel like I'm meeting 3.5s need for attention/love/snuggles because 14mo insists on being held 24/7 and it kills my spine to carry both of them. If I put the baby down (even for 5 minutes to put clothes in to wash or do a tiny bit of dishes) she will fuss and if I let her fuss for a minute it turns into full blown screaming and she intentionally faceplants hard enough that it has to hurt. Is this normal for her age? Will it eventually go away? (Partially this is teething but also she's clingy af even when not teething, and she won't let anyone hold her but me or her mother)
3.5 is pottytrained for during the day but she refuses to potty alone and pretends she needs help even though she normally goes alone at her moms house. Why? Also when should she be able to stop wearing a diaper at night?
Also she insists on calling me mom and we've argued about it for days and she does understand that I'm not mom but she just. Wont. Stop. How do I fix that?
Also how well should 3.5 be talking? She did speech therapy for a while and she's been improving while here but I feel like she should make more sense than what she does. And how much should they weigh? They wear the same size of clothing (2T) but I feel like 3.5 is undersized but probably I'm just being paranoid.
My niece and her husband recently separated and he hasn't had much to do with the little ones since then, what do I tell 3.5 when she asks about him? Sometimes she whispers gibberish in my ear and then ""mama go byebye, daddy go byebye"" and I don't know what to say to her. It happens usually between 1-5 times a day.
How do I get 3.5 to eat?! She's incredibly picky and has realized that I'm a sucker and all she'll eat for me are hot dogs, apples, blueberries, and waffles. I tried baby protein shakes and she hates them.
What should the baby be eating and drinking? She eats everything except oatmeal and I have trouble with how much is too much, plus when her sister refuses food she'll eat that as well as her own. Also her mother said to give her fat free milk so she doesn't get chunky, but I read that they're not supposed to have fat free until after age 3. Can I give both of them toddler formula? 3.5 can't have real milk anyway because it makes her sick.
Working on teaching the baby to sit in a chair at the table in a booster seat and she hates it, is there any way to make that easier?
Any magical tricks to making them sleep at bedtime? 3.5 has an ipad and she's used to staying up on it very late, but while she's here I hide it and she doesn't usually ask for it. Even without the ipad she's still pretty reluctant to sleep and usually falls asleep after the adults do. Rocking and snuggling her does not do the trick. The last couple of nights we put on a movie at 8 and slowly decrease the volume and screen brightness until it's over, but still we fell asleep before she did.

She even has a video of me breastfeeding my son because we were talking about latch; I am kicking myself over sending that video, but you can't see my face or my baby's face in it, at least. I think I've been played. I saw that she posted a picture of herself wearing a diaper... W....T.....F? She had been dropping some clues (e.g., she uses a pacifier to prevent panic attacks, focused a little way too much on what my let-down reflex feels like), but it wasn't until I saw the pic of her in a diaper that I felt very betrayed and played. Anyway, I didn't know what ABDL stood for,  so I went to the subreddit. I was in tears after just a few posts. I am beyond disturbed -- though I am still talking to this girl. I turned off my post history because I didn't want her to see this post. If there is even the slightest chance that she truly is pregnant, I want to help her. Btw, there IS some evidence that she truly is pregnant. This isn't the point of my post, though. I just needed to let all this out in a safe space, with normal people. Let me get to it: I sent my reddit friend a link to a podcast by Andrea Olsen. For those who don't know, Andrea is a big EC advocate. I was already weary about keeping my child in diapers too long after listening to Andrea's podcast about a potential link between keeping children in diapers too long and behavioral problems. I decided that as soon as my son could walk, I would begin potty training. My son is 17m, and he didn't start to walk until just a few weeks ago (FTR: He is a freakin' giant -- 99th percentile for height; my wonderful pediatrician warned me to ignore the usual timeline, as everything from rolling over to walking would likely take my son much longer than most babies). 

I'm not saying that keeping children in diapers too long is what causes the ABDL ""kink"", but it made me want to get this F-ing going.

To be fair, we haven’t had breakfast or anything, so I figured I’d go ahead and get her one real quick, she can eat that while we are at the store, and everything will be peaceful, right?

Cue to the checkout lane. She’s screaming and upset that I won’t open pouch right now to hand it to her to eat. The lady at the checkout is understanding, hands me back the pouch, we moved out of the way.

Wtf!?! She’s now SCREAMING. I try to walk us outside, try to calm her and feed her the pouch when ANOTHER man walks up to us, and says another similar remark. She’s holding the pouch - which is open - and squeezes the pouch in one of those frustrated scream/outbursts. The smoothie shoots out and is now all over.

Ever since we started our little guy on solids, he’s loved eating. And once his teeth started coming in, there was no stopping him... he would even steal things off of the rest of the family’s plates if we let him roam around after we thought he was done eating. He was never picky. And always had a great appetite. This lasted a glorious 1.5 years from about 6 months to about 24 months. This was great because we only had to deal with one picky eater, the 6-year-old (but she’d always been pretty picky, so nothing new there.) Then everything changed. 

Starting at around 24 months, he started rejecting food he would usually inhale. (Oddly enough, around the same time, the 6-yr-old started eating a little bit more). But the pasta with homemade meat sauce that was always an easy dinner for both kids became a struggle for him to eat even 1 or 2 pieces of macaroni. He spits everything out and says “all done!”  I’m worried about him not getting enough to eat, or a large enough variety of foods. He only voluntarily eats eggs, cheese, bread, rice, corn, and fruits. Almost everything else is a struggle. I try not to cave in to giving him those foods all the time, because i know it will develop terrible eating habits. Plus I don’t want the older one thinking they can reject food to get me to make macaroni and cheese daily. 

I used to love cooking and now I hate it. And when I ask hubby what I should make, he says... “anything the kids will eat.” Cue silent screaming from me while I look at the fridge for inspiration.

After four times of not being allowed back in the pool she started getting out to go poop because she wanted to get back in the pool. 

Her new place to poop is always on the playground at daycare or her play set in our backyard. It’s gotten so bad daycare puts her in a pull up to go on the playground. I’ve asked them to remove her from playing outside when she poops. One teacher from another class called me a monster. 

The problem is she knows when she has to poop and she’s deliberately doing it on the playground.

My MIL has no idea how many formulas we tried and how stressful it was as the frozen milk supply dwindled and little dude rejected every single kind sold in our city.

After he got his tongue tie fixed, he ate SO MUCH that his weight percentile went up from &lt;10th to 50th percentile. 

His early weight struggles meant he had limited energy for tummy time. We had to take him to baby PT and he still ended up having to wear a helmet for 3 months, which MIL was super judgy about. 

Never mind the “triple feeding” regimen that made the postpartum period miserable for me personally. 

We have gone into the toddler food battles very much embracing “whatever works” and focused on building a positive relationship with food over a particular menu or table manners.

From day one we’ve established a good nighttime routine which I think has helped tremendously. Part of that routine is he gets a bottle in bed (*GASP) when we put him down. We’ve recently switched from bottles to sippy cup and it’s been working just fine. Usually give him a watered down sippy cup of milk (around 6 oz). I know this is 100% against “the rules” but it’s just worked for us (husband and I) and given us the most amount of sleep, which is especially important since we both also have full time jobs. 

Lately he’s been waking up around 4am screaming which is very unusual. Not sure if it’s nightmares or teething (or combo of both), but after 45 mins+ of screaming we cave and go into his room to change him and give him another 4-6oz of watered down milk. He goes back to bed within minutes.

I’ve periodically tried sleep training over the last two years (allll the kinds) but never with much success. 

We recently tidied up his bedtime to be earlier (7:30-8), and shorter. Shower, then snack time in the kitchen, three books then two minutes singing while he’s in bed then a kiss goodnight and he stays in bed... is the goal anyway. We also added a tiny bit of melatonin. 

He’s been doing pretty good with that, although we are sliding back into him getting rocked to sleep or mostly to sleep. 

The middle of the night is a total nightmare though. He wakes me up around 12:30 am to put him back to sleep and then again around 4. Then he sleeps until 5:30 or 6 at the latest. (Older brother usually wakes up too early at 5:30 and wakes us all up moving around.) 

On worse nights he could be up every 1.5-2 hours.

She’s always surrounded by cousins and playmates almost the same age as her. Some older cousins seem to take advantage of her being younger and can’t run as fast so they just take whatever toy she’s holding when they want it. 

When they’re at home visiting, of course all toys at home belongs to my daughter, they still do the same. So I told them “no, you can’t have this at the moment as she is playing with it. You can ask if she can share her toys and you should also accept when she says no.” This was in front of my husband (who is the one related to the cousins as I don’t have a family or friends of my own here in Germany) and my in-laws heard this as well. 

They always tell my daughter to share, which is totally fine of course, but maybe treat her as you would treat a normal person and respect her decisions when she says no? Especially when it’s her toys. Because in my opinion, if you force her to share her toys not only do you disregard her feelings, you also teach the other kids to just get it because “sharing is caring” and they don’t learn how to move on when they are told no. 

My daughter is 2 and can already understand. I ask if she can share with me her food or toys NICELY all the time. I say thank you when she does and I say ok when she doesn’t want to share. I think it’s about respect. She’s a kid but doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve it. 

Also, when it is us visiting her cousins, it’s the same. When they don’t want to share, I tell my daughter to find other toys to play with. She cries, yes, but she’s gonna learn that it’s not hers and if the owner doesn’t want her to borrow it she can’t.

I won't rehash here but we have tried literally everything (including a different bedroom) and here's where I need help because my regular moms groups haven't seen anything like it.    


If we cut naps completely, and only do quiet/rest times, she will go to bed at bedtime with a minimum of fuss.  She is asleep by 8 -9pm, or 9:30 at the latest.  (I can't tell you how long this has been a battle) and this has been consistent for over a week, so we're pumped.  (If there's a nap of any significant length, especially in the afternoon, she will battle us at bedtime until 11PM or later, then everything is thrown off for a couple days)   


Problem is, she will wake up around 5 nights a week between 1AM and 3AM, and will not be able to get back to sleep for a minimum of 3 hours.  Then she sleeps another 3-5 hours.    


Does anyone have any advice for a child that has difficulty going back to sleep?  Especially when she's clearly tired and will truly lay still or be rocked for hours upon hours.

But NOW?! Holy cow, he is terrified of me leaving the room and says he doesnt want me to leave him. He calls out for me about 2 minutes. I have to sit in the bathroom just to have him take a bath without driving me insane.

The other day he said ""I feel different."" when asked why he said, ""I'm worried about you"". He couldnt articulate why, but that makes me sad.

He is acting really uncharacteristically naughty lately too.

He sleeps with me and bedtime is a nightmare because he wont stop touching me.

Is it the Halloween stuff? He loves that stuff! Is it a delayed reaction to the separation?

I get they go through a stage like this I guess, but for how long? I reassure him CONSTANTLY that I love him so much and that hes safe and I would never leave him and I tell him all about the things I love about him.

This is driving me insane and hurting my heart and making me feel guilty all at the same time.

As long as she's bottomless.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how we initially trained her. She had a few accidents on the carpet for a  week or so then she got the idea. Adding underwear to the mix has proven..... unsuccessful. This child HATES it if anyone is near her (a trait she gained from me. 12 years together and my wife has seen me pee only about 4 or 5 times) So the child loathes that you assist her. When she has either a pullup or a pair of training underwear she treats them like diapers and just goes in them. She will even pull the underwear off herself after going in them, So I KNOW she knows how to take them off.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm at a loss with a munchkin who is too stubborn to get help, but KNOWS the basics of what to do. She's been half potty trained like this for months. Winter is coming in Wisconsin and going pant-less is, shall we say unwise. even with heat cranked you truly never get warm.

I’m so tired of it. She’s relentless and I just don’t like her anymore. I love her of course, but I really don’t enjoy spending time with her anymore unless were cuddling watching tv. It’s the only time I feel like I’m having a nice time with her and enjoying her company.

She’s just fucking crazy. She has been way above average activity levels since before she was even born. She was walking and climbing around the time most kids her age were just starting to crawl. At baby classes, she would be literally running around the room while her peers sat nicely in their moms laps. She doesn’t stop. She loves to scream. All she ever wants to play and do are super physical activties. The first thing she says to me in the morning is “go outside?” 

She doesn’t listen even though she understands. She’s defiant. She thinks it’s funny to be bad. She will do the exact thing I tell her not to while *screaming* “DON’T [thing she’s doing]”  She’ll ask for a food, I’ll give it to her, and even though I know it’s something she likes, she’ll spit it out and say ew because she thinks it’s funny. She’s aggressive and violent. She pulls hair and kicks and thinks it’s funny to hit. When I make her say sorry she says it with the most shit eating grin you can imagine.

I always feel sorry for myself. I just want a normal child. Sometimes I feel so genuinely amazed and perplexed at people with two kids, all those people who around 1 or 1.5 decided they could grow their families an add another.. HOW?? Then I remember they have fucking normal children. 

I want a shy one. A reserved child. A quiet one. Man, I want to be that mom who has to push and encourage her child to try new things. I hate bringing mine to the park because she will find the highest, most dangerous, meant for much older kids equipment there and run up it immediately. I hate play dates because her behavior just embarrasses me. I spend the whole time apologizing and just wishing my child could be like the others. It’s not fair.

One time he told an overweight woman that she “probably doesn’t need more cupcakes, you can have a banana if you want a treat”. I don’t know where this comes from because I’ve never discussed the link to unhealthy food and being overweight with him and the topic only comes up in the grocery store. If he sees someone buying chicken or fish he yells, “hey!! Hey you!!! Did you know someone cut that fish/chicken’s head off?” He loves telling people about the head being cut off, he thinks they don’t know this and he’s genuinely providing them new and useful information. He is very social and will try to start conversations with everyone and anyone, about anything. Yesterday I was bagging my groceries while an elderly man was bagging next to us. Suddenly I hear, “HEY OLD MAN!” I turn around give some the look and say “stop”, but he does it again. Then he looks at me and shouts “THIS OLD GUY’s EARS ARE BROKEN LIKE GRANDMAS HE DOESN’t KNOW IM TALKING TO HIM”. I explain if he wants to talk to someone he should say excuse me first and ask their name, not call them things like “old man”.... “EXCUSE ME OLD MAN!

Son: “HI PETER, NICE TO MEET YOU TOO, DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY VERY OLD?”. I turned around and scolded my son, Peter thought I was scolding him (he obviously was pretty deaf), anyways it was extremely awkward.

It's at the point where he'll laugh or will tell me he'll make me snake soup. We've also talked about serious things like death and getting hurt and as far as I can tell, he understands those fairly well.

He's been learning about the solar system at school and last night, his aunt told him that the sun will eventually be sucked in by a black hole or it will run out of gas, thus ending life on earth. This is fine, it's all real, we have been reading lots of planet/solar system books to him too. He nodded and we thought nothing more of it.

Come 10:19pm he came out of his room in TEARS telling me, ""mama I don't want the sun to be sucked into a black hole. I don't want the sun to run out of gas"" So of course I had to comfort him.

The easiest thing would have been to lie and told him that's not happening, but that's not our style so the real struggle began. I thought about telling him that it's not gonna happen in his lifetime but I didn't want tonight to be the night for him to have another existential fear about death even though we've talked about it before. It was hard to explain to him the concept of millions and millions of years b/c he thinks 100 is the largest number ever. 

After a while I settled on ""everything comes to an end someday, but the sun disappearing will happen far away in the future and for now, you are safe with mommy and daddy. I'm here for you"" and then I patted him to sleep. (I did stutter through most of it, so it's not nearly as smooth as I have it in my head, but it was enough to convince him)

Like, I think I did OK. Funny thing is all this time I've prepared myself for the social issues talks but completely forgot that there are a million other things that scare kids. It reminded me of when I was five and I accidentally put foot cream on my nose and my classmates told me the doctors will have to cut off my nose and it TERRIFIED me. I still remember the nightmare of being cut apart like a steamed egg (popular dish in China). And when I finally got the courage to ask my dad he completely blew me off.

As of last week he still had a bottle of milk just before bedtime and two bottles at night. 

Two days ago we decided to drop the night feeds because of two reasons. 

First, he already has 13 teeth and I’ve read that nighttime bottle feeds can cause tooth decay.

And second, he really likes food, is open to try anything new and not picky, but eating not very much as he’s having more than 400 ml (14 oz) of milk at night, so there is no reason at all for him to increase the amount of food he eats.

Night weaning itself is working surprisingly well. First night he was whining and moaning for about 20 to 30 minutes at 4 am, after that slept till his normal wake up time.

Tonight he stirred and whined for 2 - 3 minutes a couple of times, but again slept till wake up time.

I’m very happy about this! But here is my problem.

Since yesterday he ate very little and refused to have breakfast altogether this morning. He just had half a piece of toast and very little of a fruit pouch as a snack before his first nap.

I’m very worried he isn’t eating enough but I don’t want to fall back on bottles.

A bit of background to explain my son’s nature incase anyone is able to offer any advice if their kids are similar....

So as like most toddlers, my son is REALLY active. He is 21 months now. When he was younger, mostly when he first started walking (around 1 years old) I always said I probably wouldn’t need to use any kind of toddler harness as I vowed I would try to ‘teach’ him now to walk nicely next to me. I had visions of us strolling together down the road hand in hand calmly within the first few months of him learning to walk. This was very short lived or more that I had skipped a couple of years in my head past the 18month+ stage all the way to perhaps the 5 year old stage. Plus he is the kind of little boy who literally just runs EVERYWHERE without any cautiousness or care for anything! (A cousin of his around the same age is the complete opposite - he will wait for his mum or be cautious to go anywhere without her, I guess it’s just down to individual personality!)

In the past week he has become so difficult to walk with on the road or even in a shopping centre and also has started to throw tantrums if he’s trapped in his stroller for a period of time, mostly because he wants to get out and walk himself. He doesn’t EVER really walk and only runs, to the point where even a fast paced walk is not enough to keep up with him, I now have to jog. He’s also SO quick and I worry he will get himself into danger or hurt himself. He doesn’t want to hold my hand (he never really does!) and I’m actually quite terrified to do this anyway because he will pull the other way - a few months ago he had ‘pulled elbow’ (the nurse said he probably is more prone to getting it in future too and to be careful.) He doesn’t like to listen much to me/doesn’t yet have the understanding of danger/gets so distracted and excited by being able to walk free somewhere. I want him to experience walking and seeing the world on his own legs, but in safest way possible.

We were given one of those bags which has a harness attachment as a gift and have tried it, but it just isn’t cutting it. I really think I need a proper one, and probably one that is more supportive too and comfortable. I don’t entirely love the idea of using one while we are out BUT if it means to keeps him safe, then that’s more of a priority.

What sort of car should we be looking at to get the necessary amount of space to be comfortable?

We don't want a huge SUV, but wouldn't rule out a medium-sized one if it would be big enough to be comfortable. It seems like estate cars (called station wagons in North America?) aren't really fashionable any more, but that they might be the answer. Would the estate version of Golf be long enough, or should we be looking at something like a Passat Estate? I'm just sticking to VW here for ease of comparison - I'm not brand loyal.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on how comfortable they find their cars with two child seats in them.

2. He currently takes 2 naps (morning and afternoon) at home, but they will be on a 1 nap schedule. We have tried a 1 nap schedule at home and it has gone poorly.

3. The biggest thing I feel ashamed to admit - we still rock our son to sleep for his naps and for bed. He also sleeps in a sleepsack, in his dark room with a sound machine. Obviously the majority of this cannot be replicated at daycare.

&amp;#x200B;

My 4 year old son (almost 5) had a stroke during labor. He technically has a diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. Much like adult stroke victims, he does not have any real mobility control of his left hand or left arm. He also has some issue with mobility with his left leg but to a much lesser extent. He had a brain scan done when he was about 1 years old when we found out the diagnosis. Pretty much all of the damage is on the left side of his brain, that controls movement. The language, emotions, and intellectual side of the brain was not damaged (this at least is how the doctors explained it to us). He has perfect verbal skills for his age and is actually very smart. He is social and loving with others and has many friends at school. He expresses emotions correctly. He is, by all accounts, a beautiful and friendly smart little boy. Most people have no idea there is anything wrong with him until they notice that he doesn't use his left arm. In school he is in regular K4 classes and does great. He goes to physical therapy and occupational therapy to try to help him use his arm more. He is also learning how to use things around his disabilities like how to do certain things one handed etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago though we noticed he has a problem. We got a switch and he is able to play it with the individual controller and his good hand. He loves Mario Party, Mario Kart, Kirby etc. I mean....he's obsessed. But we noticed he \*cannot\* for the life of him sit still while playing. He wiggles about, writhes, kicks his feet etc. He runs around all over the place almost frantically. The worst part is that he wants to be in your lap while you play together, but two seconds later he's back up again, then back in your lap, then back up again etc. He also claims ""I'm so cold!"" so you put him under the blanket on the sofa but two seconds later he's off the sofa again bouncing around but saying ""Mommy I'm cold! I need the blanket!"" and its like....you were under the blanket but you got out not even ten seconds later! When he is in your lap, he does these constant mico movements that are almost like repeated muscle contractions like he can't help but fidget. He also jumps on the sofa when you're playing games together. But its almost like compulsive because you will say ""Stop jumping"" and he will say ""Ok"" but not even five seconds later, he's jumping again. You say ""Didn't I say no jumping?"" and he will go ""OK mommy sorry"" and then not three seconds later he's jumping again. But its seriously like he doesn't even realize he's doing it, its just like a compulsive thing for him that he just does without even realizing he's doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing is that he often talks over my husband and I when we try to talk. I know thats normal toddler behavior but he just says the same things over and over again. And this is the other big part of that issue- ""Hey mommy. What can we do? Mommy. What can we do today. Hey mommy. Mommy. Hey Mommy."" ""WHAT?"" ""I love you"" ""He says some variation of this probably a thousand times a day.Hearing ""hey mommy"" is starting to make me want to rip my hair out. Because he rarely actually WANTS anything. ""Hey mommy, can I have a snack?"" is fine. ""Hey mommy can you help me go potty"" is fine. But it's always just ""Hey mommy.......hey mommy......"" and then some nonsense like ""What can we do"" or when he can tell I'm getting aggravated he switches to ""Hey mommy, I love you"" because he thinks I can't get mad if what he's saying is ""I love you"". My husband was on the computer last night and I was trying to watch TV while he was watching videos on his iPad. Absentmindedly he said ""Hey mommy, what can we do"" and I said ""Well you're watching videos and then its time for bed"" about one minute later he said ""Hey mommy......mommy.....mommy.....what can we do....."" and I said ""I just said after videos we can go to bed"".....not even a minute later ""Hey mommy...."" to which I snapped and shouted ""WHAT????"" because I had been hearing it for hours at this point. He said ""Mommy....I love you"" which of course made me feel like a jerk for snapping at him. I said ""I love you too buddy"". NOT EVEN TWO MINUTES LATER he goes ""Hey mommy..........I love you......"" like he hadn't just said that. My husband came around from the computer room and was like ""I can hear you just repeating yourself for no reason other than to bother mommy!""

&amp;#x200B;

Its driving me up a wall and I'm wondering if this is normal toddler behavior? The thing is, we are always on the look out for signs that he might have any special needs mentally because its a possibility that this can happen as he gets older. The other thing is that these behaviors feel like compulsions. Its like.....he has to say something, even if its nothing at all, he has to says something just to say something but its not just regular toddler chatter because its just the same handful of things over and over (usually, what can we do, or I love you, but always prefaced with the drawn out 'hey mommy' first). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm beginning to wonder if I should talk to his physical therapist or his pediatrician about if he might have some kind of sensory processing disorder or compulsive behavior, I just don't know if I'm over reacting or not.

I don’t think we are being overly mean, but her reactions are making me think twice. She will instantly tear up with big tears and start crying like she’s hurt. And to be clear right off the bat, we aren’t touching her or yelling during these interactions. 

Here’s an example: 
Last night she is sitting with me at our high top kitchen table. Now, I hate this table because she’s so wiggly and about falls off every time we sit there. But it’s the older table of our two and takes toddler abuse better than our dining room table. We have tried talking to her about sitting still and that she could get hurt, but you know, toddlers don’t care. So she’s sitting there being all wiggly and about falls off but catches herself last minute. She was obviously caught off guard and I told her in a stern voice to be careful and sit still. I probably shouldn’t have been stern, but I had already asked 10 times and she was NOT listening. She instantly starts tearing up and crying. But crocodile tears that just kept flowing. 

Is this normal? I don’t know why lately this is her response. I know she’s testing boundaries but her reactions seem disproportionate with how we are correcting her. Should we be changing our response for correcting her? When we ask nicely or try to make it a choice, she just smiles slyly and keeps doing what she wants to do. I wouldn’t mind dealing with this once in a while but lately it’s any time we have to correct her or ask her to stop doing something dangerous. Like falling off chairs, trying to touch the stove, etc.

I am having so much trouble with my 3 year old and sleep. He sleeps through the night just fine, but getting him to sleep is the problem. Most nights it takes him 1-1.5 hours to fall asleep. I heard it should only take 20-30 min for a toddler to fall asleep and I dont know what to do to help with that. I feel like ive tried everything and if something does help, it only works for a week or so and then he struggles to fall asleep again. The only way I've really gotten him to fall asleep without any problems is if he's up until 11-12am (which is way to long for him to be up especially with no naps).

We tried switching him to a real bed and he would never stay in bed and thats when it usually took the longest to fall asleep - some nights it would take 3 hours to get him to sleep and the only way he would stay in bed is if someone was in there with him, which was fine but I didn't want to make a habit of it bc I was pregnant and didn't know how that would work with a newborn. I know transitioning him takes time but even after 7-8 months it never seems to get any easier.

We switched him back to a crib shortly before the baby was born bc nothing seemed to help. That obviously kept him in bed, but he still has trouble falling asleep. I feel like somewhat of a failure bc he should be in a real bed by now but I just cant keep up with putting him back to bed for hours and trying to put the baby down.

Now that the baby is easier to get to sleep and sleeping longer, I feel its time to try and switch him to a real bed again but I just don't know what to do. He's also said a few times he wanted to sleep in the big bed vs his crib so idk maybe now he's ready? He doesn't take naps anymore bc he wont fall asleep and if he does it makes bedtime even harder bc he seems to have so much more energy. We tried multiple different routines but they never seem to last, like no TV 3 hours before bed, no sweets before bed, no electronics before bed, etc. We tried this bubble bath and lotion that had lavender, chamomile and melatonin in it. I've tried diffusing lavender and chamomile oils in his room and putting it on his pillow. Right now the routine we are doing is a bath shortly after dinner and then get dressed/brush teeth and then stories and then bed..he never seems scared in his room just seems like he can't fall asleep and I also feel bad just leaving him up there for hours to fall asleep.

I'm not sure what to try anymore, one thing I noticed is if he's in bed by 7pm he falls asleep pretty quick compared to normal. But then after a few days or so he was waking up around 4am, sometimes 2. Im not sure if i should start trying to give him naps again, idk if he's just overtired and fighting it. Im not sure if I just have to keep sticking to the same routine even after he goes back to having trouble falling asleep, maybe after a few weeks it will start to get better/shorter? Im not sure anymore how to help him bc I feel like I've tried it all. It just seems to make it hard on him when he's falling asleep late but waking somewhat early (early compared to the time he fell asleep) and then refusing to nap and then also refusing to sleep.

I had envisioned us going to play groups, music classes, library classes, gymnastics... all things we used to do precocious and now can’t do because of the virus. I feel cheated because I won’t be able to do any of those classes if he enrolls in the toddler program next year (they are all morning weekday classes). 

What would you do? Should I keep him home another year so we can do all these mom and me classes and try to get him in through the 3k lottery in the 22-23 school year? Or should I sign him up for the toddler class next year (21-22 school year) so I know he’ll have a spot. I already applied to the program and need to accept by Nov 1 to guarantee him a spot in the toddler program.

He will only be going 2 days a week. Classes are cut in half. Teachers wears masks. Kids it’s optional. So far, he’s gone one day, and is already sick 😬 AFTER ONE DAY. He was in school last year until March and was sick off and on constantly, which I expected. But of course, with covid, now I’m concerned I may have made the wrong decision sending him back already. I knew he’d get sick but not this fast! 

I understand it’s an inherited risk sending him back, but I’m trying to weigh both his and my mental health as well (I had to stop working to take care of him for the past 6 months the we quarantined). He has been desperate to be around other kids again (as I’m sure all kids are at this point). He’s an only child and has taken to mostly terrorizing our cat. But his dad and I need to work (we own our own business). We’ve gotten busier and my husband needs help. And I WANT to work. I am not the type that can do the SAHM thing full time. I’ve been doing it for 3 years and I need the mental stimulation of work. 

I had him with a nanny for the past month, but she could only give him so much of what he needs socially. Plus she works at a restaurant and is young, so who knows what she’s up to. I don’t feel like having her come is a particularly lower risk of exposure. 

Plus my son was so happy when I picked him up last week from school. Like beaming from ear to ear. But shit! It’s like I can’t win. Send him back, possibly get covid. Don’t send him back, he’s semi miserable as am I. 

I tried to form a “pod” and it was a logistic nightmare. Finding a teacher was imposible too. They all wanted like 70-80/hour for 3-4 kids and full time jobs. So that fell apart quickly. Plus getting the parents on the same page was impossible. I wasted a month of time trying to make it happen. 

Finally found this preschool. Maybe I just need to make him wear a mask at school? I know some kids are and some are not. 

On top of this, and I know I’m going to get flak for this, I have a compromised immune system (Crohn’s disease), so apparently I’m higher risk? I guess. I haven’t had a flare in 6 years because I follow a strict diet and have been super healthy since. But I wonder how my body would and could deal with covid if I got it. Who knows.

1. On mobile so I apologize for the format. 
2. My first post
2. TDLR; I am closely connected with “Blippi” but the person, &amp; I have gotten hate for it, fake people who have tried to use my close connection, my son is going to be in a few new videos &amp; I am creeped out I have my friends merchandise, especially the doll of my childhood friend! 

 
So I truly did grow-up with “Blippi”, &amp; closely, not just acquaintances! I am not only from the same town in central WA, but he is actually a great friend of mine! He was a grade below me, &amp; was one of my brothers best friends, and his sister (his only sibling) was a grade ahead of me! She was a good friend, but we drifted apart due to different social paths, but we remained and are good! He actually had a HUGE crush on me! I have love letters from him, and in my yearbooks he used to purposely make my brother mad by telling me in detail why he liked me! His loves letters are also VERY FUNNY! He was always funny, and he was always wanting to make people laugh, but he was also made fun of by older peers...who is laughing now as their kids are all addicted to his show, &amp; are forced to line his pockets with his merchandise! I’m literally SURPRISED that nobody has once sold him out by a large media outlet for money! We have that type of hometown (I literally know of 3 peers who went on Dr. Phil-1 was a made up story) as they are also the people who literally have maybe only gone to Seattle (maybe 90 minutes away) a handful of times and think it’s some HUGE, and crazy big city?! It’s not, luckily I have a parent who has always lived there so I was exposed to more than my peers! I have also lived downtown for years now, &amp; it’s kinda a small place. But due to the things known it’s actually weird as I just thought of it while I am writing this! 

So he’s changed his name spelling, and he has made his life and history, ESPECIALLY in regards to his family to protect them. I personally know why and this has brought me into some of the most bizarre situations, 90% online! This WHY I could see someone to sell something to the media for money...sad. 

I am in A LOT of mom groups online! Especially larger ones, &amp; the bigger groups are all connected to one main group, I don’t want to say the name of the main group, but it’s got like 30+ sub-groups. Whenever I mention it, which I only admitted it once in one of the more drama base groups (they each are on a drama spectrum; and some have men too). 
Ugh... I got INTERROGATED more than I have about other things that are actually a lot more interesting or could be accused of being unreal! Most people who had CLEARLY done some serious digging into him to know things most people who aren’t even in the same age bracket for our hometown to know?! Most were all cool but I got hated on too. Especially when I didn’t discuss details of his family. Which I won’t now either, and I know why he has gone to a lot of effort to hide his family!  Wow I showed an email exchange and I had blocked his more personal info out but enough to know I wasn’t lying it was FINALLY all doubters were cool about, and I of course had some random haters for me just knowing someone &amp; proved it was real! 

I have more than the contact information that proved us to be close, that’s way more personal information which I won’t share. He did thank me privately in another separate exchange via text as I was explaining the story initially, &amp; he was like,
“Yeah...sorry [insert my name] those are probably the same moms that send me nudes, videos and mail me panties! They even mention their kids names asking me for stuff or just are horny bored moms!” 
So when he sent me back an email kinda taking a shot at the moms who cyberstalk him, including the mean hater moms (the most) it was kinda justice! This was awhile ago &amp; I NEVER thought it would follow me online? 

I have since had people who either remember that stupid thread, or followed haters online for a bit, and then I will get like 1-2 random random moms PM’ing from all over asking me if it’s true I am “the girl from [Insert Mom Groups Name(s)] that is friends with Blippi?” And ask if I can get free stuff, his info, a sad story of why their child’s life would change by him personally doing SOMETHING, and then the other moms who want to be in a video. Those video request ones, they ALWAYS seem to know before he has a video setup to film pretty far ahead, I have no idea how? Which is almost always then met with “my child is so much better than yours to be in one!” Ummm, RUDE! Plus he hasn’t been able to do one yet?! He’s literally asked me about it because my brother, who was so close to him, well he passed away their senior year, and my son happens to look IDENTICAL to him! Which my brother I’m referring to as I have more than one (5 total) often were assumed to be twins! But still, I can’t believe that 1 random comment from over a year ago has caused me to get my child hated on and they typically have somehow found me on IG which I am SUPER careful with privacy stuff on social media due to my sons father &amp; having a protective order for my son and I. 

My son was gifted a doll of “Blippi” (Stephen lol) after I FINALLY gave in to him knowing about him, and he is also very aware that I actually do know him, but he has not yet realized he’s not actually the character in real life! I’m going to soon shatter his sense of innocence by him doing a video and getting to hang out with him in the near future! BACK TO THE DOLL.... I have found myself hiding him because I am CREEPED out by my childhood friends voice coming out of this doll that kinda looks like a guy I know! -Best way to explain it! 

Before I get any hate, or people who go after me and try to or maybe succeed in my identity, just know I am not going to say anything about his family life. I will gladly answer questions about it.

Like to help them sleep? It seems to help my little boy a whole heck of a lot, but honestly I was extremely sleep deprived when it occurred to me to try it, and, thinking on it now, the tones won’t hinder his brain development in any way, right? I don’t see how they could, but I’m not a scientist. Please no judgment, just curious about what everyone thinks about this.  I’ve done a little searching online but can’t find any articles specifically pertaining to children.

**Some background: my son is 17 months old. I suspect he might have ADD like me (though who knows rn. But, genetics, so I’m mindful) He would probably stay up all night if we let him... a night owl with boundless energy. As for me, I literally cannot sleep without an eye mask and binaural beats in my earbuds. As a young child, I was an insomniac too, a common problem for people with ADHD (my parents still speak of the “years they went without sleep”) Anyway, now that my boy has this white (well, “brown”) noise playing in the background at night, when he wakes up, after midnight usually, my partner just gives him a bottle in his crib, not even picking him up. The boy drinks it, throwing it away when he’s done. Falls back asleep. Magical. He even slept through the night once last week (!!) So, I can see it’s working fairly well BUT it goes without saying, if it’s hurting him in the long run, it’s not worth it. Not to mention, I can just play the brown noise setting without the isochronic tones underneath it. I’m sure it would still help... 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Tl;dr ;; are isochronic tones safe for babies to listen to while they sleep at night? 

If he is getting more sleep than he was before, I feel it’s probably benefitting him not harming him. Any insight from other parents is extremely appreciated.

FYI I use the AmbiSci100P app that’s available on the App Store, &amp; the Sleep-Deep HP/SPK setting with Brown Noise, if anyone feels their child would benefit (or even yourself) There are tons of free apps like that one available on both stores.

It’s unlikely of her to wake up in the middle of the night. We think it’s because she had to go, but was holding it in.

I don't mind distracting him when he has a tantrum because I won't carry him to the pop figure area, or just letting him scream it out when I put him down and stop carrying him. But he's always been a biter and recently he's started hitting. Especially when he doesn't get what he wants by also just in general. 

Examples. Today he started getting fussy because I sat down with him on the couch instead of standing with him. He started crying and ""slapped""(failed his arm) at me. He also started hitting his father's head for fun. Then later he was sitting next to the dog petting her, this is new, so I said ""good job! Good gentle!"" To which he giggled and then hit her. When I said ""no! Gentle pets"" he was gentle again but then started laughing and hitting her. 
 
His father laughs generally but I'm pretty constant on ""no hitting!"" Grab his hand he's hitting with and put him on the floor. When he's done with his tantrum I offer him toys and cuddles and he's fine.  The same with the biting. When he was still in my stomach i called him my xenomorph and that was a mistake.

Stressed-out mom of a freshly two-year old boy here. We're trying the Oh Crap method and failing miserably. 3 says in and each day has seen a touch more improvement than the last, but that's really not saying much. I'm talking 2.5 pees and 1.3/2 poops made it into the potty today, and countless pees made it onto the floor. He pees (and sometimes starts pooping) on the floor constantly. A small, lightning-speed puddle will appear, he'll shout, ""Pee!"" then run around until our cries to get to the potty lead him to sit down. Then.... Nothing. He doesn't finish the pee. Ever. Not a drop. So we wait, we gently tell him how nice it would feel/be to let the pee out, and we read books or play with him while he sits on the potty. He will sometimes help us clean up, but usually we're more focused on trying to get him to finish the pee rather than make more of a mess. 

I've never seen someone with such bladder control that he can go 10, 15, 20 minutes at a time without a drop. Then he'll get up, take a lap around the room, and produce another small puddle for us to start the process over again with. I can even tell he really has to go from holding it so long, but the potty doesn't seem to do anything but shut everything up tight. The times he does go, even if it's just a drop, we're always sure to praise him and give him high-fives, and his face lights up. (We don't really want to go down the road of using other rewards.) But this isn't apparently enough to learn how to release his urine on purpose on the potty. Or does this sound like a behavior issue? My husband and I are at his wit's end, and on Monday when the workweek starts, I'll be all on own again.

I’m new here and this is my first time posting. My son turned 2 on 08/03, I started to look into early intervention when he was a little over 18 months. He had a few words but not nearly what he was supposed to. We started with ABA (which wasn’t clarified until a couple of weeks ago, everyone kept referring to it as speech therapy) and he doesn’t love it. We started when everything was shutting down and have only done video calls, I’m doing the sessions with the therapist but everything seems to be a chore for him. 

Now, my main concern at the beginning was speech. They explained that the ABA needed to be the first step to ensure that he was able to sit down and pay attention during speech. We are in the process now of requesting speech and OT. 

Our therapist is a bit of an alarmist. Throughout the day he doesn’t behave like he does during the session, every little thing he does she comments about how she sees him having sensory issues and possibly stim (he crossed his fingers, avoids looking at me when I’m asking him to follow a command, and rocks back and forth trying to get out of the chair). I’m feeling very overwhelmed, I know that he doesn’t do any of that throughout the day but that’s all she sees during that hour. She mentioned that if I was to take him to a development pediatrician app he might end up diagnosed with autism. 

He plays pretend, has good eye contact throughout the day, imitated nursery rhymes and other things we do, gets excited when we’re going out and tries to put my shoes and he’s shoes on. Say bye and waves, can follow one step commands (turn light off, come or get out, sit, if you ask him to stop doing something he stops). 

He, however, avoids responding to his name. I say avoids because if I’m sitting facing him and say he’s name he’ll look. If my husband calls him he’ll look up but if he’s doing something and you call his name he won’t stop what he’s doing and look at you. She says that children he’s age are pleasers and he should be able to look up when he’s been called just to please us. 

Sometimes I look at him and I can see he’s behind, he’s never been around other children he’s age and has never been to daycare. A lot of the behaviors she sees and has mentioned do not happen when we’re out and about, he loves to be around other people. 

I know early intervention is great and the best thing we can do for him right now but I’m feeling very overwhelmed. I’m looking at him and almost trying to justify every little thing he does and it’s driving me nuts. His therapist did say once that if that wasn’t the behavior throughout the day that it was probably him being stubborn and wanting to be child-led instead of adult-directed. 

I wanted to see other’s experiences with the program. I don’t even know what a 2 year old should or shouldn’t be doing, kids are so different. When I called a few daycares to explain where he’s at right now, there response was that most 2 year olds are the same. 

Sorry for the long post!! I have been so worry that I might be missing something and not getting him the help he needs.",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,79195,public,self,Getting overwhelmed with early intervention,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/j4jvez/getting_overwhelmed_with_early_intervention/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We are all good with night time sleep. We have a routine. It works well. She sleeps all night. No issues there.

But I cannot seem to get her to take her nap on her own. As in *I have to rock her to sleep* or she won’t sleep at all. If I let her fall asleep on her own she’ll take her nap waaaay to close to night time and then won’t sleep until 1-2am. Not only that but she turns into shehulk and I get nothing done around the house and end up angry and frustrated.

She is at the point were she only takes one nap, which is right after lunch at around 1:30-2:00. She takes a looong time to fall asleep, 15mins to 30mins of rocking. I’ve tried to just cuddle but she doesn’t like it, *I need to rock her.* She is 18 months and starting to get heavy and sometimes fights sleep (and she *is* sleepy!) and throws her head back and gives me bruises. 

I’ve tried to just let her not sleep at her usual time and let her take her nap when she becomes exhausted but I couldn’t do it past the week. She just becomes unbearable to me. That 1:30min to 2hr nap she takes in the middle of the days makes us both more happy...

But I’m tired of rocking her to sleep. My right arm seems to have a bruise on it all the time. I know I should cherish this. She won’t need me to rock her to sleep soon. But dear lord I’m tired of it. 

I can’t make her room dark to simulate night, her room has a long rectangular window on the very top that’s not reachable. I’ve tried mimicking her sleep time routine and it hasn’t worked.

First time poster here. I have a 2 year old son (2 years, 2 months) who is normally a good sleeper. Did minor sleep training around 9 months to cut out night feeds, but other than that, I have just worked very hard to instill good habit (both in him and in us as parents).

We always do his nighttime routine, which ends with Mom, Dad and toddler reading 2 books together, then a family hug and in to bed he goes. Usually, no fussing occurs and he’s asleep within 15 minutes. I have a white noise machine with a nightlight on it, which we use for naps and nighttime.

For the last week or so, he has started to scream and cry when we leave the room. We have always shut his door tight which was never an issue. I do not want to get in to the habit of laying with him until he falls asleep. Yesterday, he cried for mom and dad for 10 minutes. Dad went in and rubbed his back for about 2-3 minutes, then left. Once again, toddler cried for about 10 minutes, and eventually put himself to sleep. I’m not one to usually let him cry it out, and normally wouldn’t allow him to cry for more than 15 minutes.

Thankfully he is not (yet) waking in the night, but wakes up crying between 5:30 and 6. Normally he will sleep until 6:30 at the earliest, and then play quietly until we go get him around 7. 

He was moved to a toddler bed in early August as he was climbing out of his crib. We had a minor setback after that but it only lasted about a week.

I have read about nighttime fears, 2 year molars, and other things that can affect sleep. I’m sure this is normal! Just looking for some tips and tricks that have worked for other parents in order to avoid having to stay with him until he falls asleep.

So our almost 16 month old is still not walking on her own. She just started pulling herself up when in her crib or in the play area (there are long skinny bars so it’s easier for her wrap her hands around it). She never crawled and started scooting some months ago. Right after her first birthday she scooted her butt right off our bed. She broke her leg, it was a buckle fracture or something to that effect. The docs said she has since healed beautifully and will have no long term issues but she’s still not walking. She pretty much failed all the gross motor skills for the 15 month exam. She had only just started pulling her self up right before that apt. Doc said he isn’t concerned because it’s normal for a lot of kids not to walk until 18 months. Okay. Fine. 
Fast forward a month and today the daycare pulled me aside when I picked her up because they’re concerned she’s not pulling herself up. Now they say kids are falling over her. They asked if we have thought about physical therapy. Just wondering if anyone else has had this sort of experience. When I told the teacher that her doctor thinks she’ll be walking by Dec, and if not we’ll start therapy then she said it isn’t the walking that’s concerning her. It’s that she won’t move at all unless other kids are there and that she doesn’t know how to fall. (She mist falls, there’s no sort of bending legs or putting hands down to stop it). I don’t know what to do about the falling thing. I’m scared to let her fall since the whole broken leg thing. Our floors are so hard. 
I already felt crappy because of the whole leg debacle but I mean now I’m feeling even worse because i feel like I singlehandedly have delayed her development. Not sure what I’m looking for here.

In my house, at the moment, I have a few toddler hacks that have been working well for us! For reference my toddler is 18m! 

• [condiment cup, baby spoon &amp; plastic bib](https://imgur.com/a/EmVsy16) is a great way for toddler to learn to eat yogurt, apple sauce, and cereal independently. Sure there’s still a mess, sometimes multiple servings, but it’s been a good transition to independent eating with utensils for us! 

• [toddler shelf](https://imgur.com/a/JMSmjHv) in the fridge has been wonderful! We just started it, but all of her cups, and anything we would allow her to get on her own would be on this shelf! As she gets older this will no doubt have more on it and change, but again I think it’s a good start to some independence, especially because she’ll have a sister in roughly 2 months! So I’m trying to help her be independent where we can! 

•[bathroom sink stool ](https://imgur.com/a/OPhWJR4) an oldie, classic and a goodie. Just never thought I would use it on such a young toddler! She loves to wash her hands and brush her teeth so it’s been working great for us!

Just after some commiseration / figuring out if this is normal or a phase.

Our 2.5 year old loves day care. He hasn’t had any extended break from it. However day care mornings are a STRUGGLE. He will be happy then I get him out to bed and he cries. Then I change his nappy and he is happy. Feed him breakfast he is happy. Put on shoes and he throws a fit because he knows he is leaving the house. Happy in the car. As soon as he sees day care he starts crying. We can’t go into the centre because of COVID so the carers take him crying from my arms. However during day he LOVES day care and has no issues. Then home time comes and he runs away from me and hides and cries when we take him home.



It’s just very disheartening - he cries when we take him TO day care and cries when he has to go home. Can’t make him happy either way. He has been a bit miserable from teething (2yo molars) but this is even outside of that because even with pain medication and being perfectly happy five seconds ago he starts clinging to me like a koala. I’m just not sure what to do or if it’s just a phase as it’s only started recently.


I give him plenty of pre warning in the morning, I try to give him space and time to play in the morning and not “rush” him and stress him out, in the afternoons we give lots of love and cuddles. 

It’s just hard to not be able to make him happy.

Any ideas? Or is it just an expression of his frustration at lack of choice / control?

He’s been going to the same day care since he was 8 months old, hasn’t had a break, and used to be absolutely fine on drop off and pick up up until a couple of months ago.

He does have some gaps - he goes Mon, Tues, Thurs. so I wondered if he’s suddenly gotten old enough to feel really disrupted with an odd routine?

I'm also a good/experienced cook so I'm up for making something from scratch, but I'm out of ideas on what will satisfy his hunger urges and also not be super unhealthy. He loves crunchy stuff (don't we all) but even things like Veggie Straws have a ton of salt.

He's up usually 2 times a night, and I'm currently giving him a small bottle of half milk half water for him to fall back asleep. I'm trying to get it down to just water, but he throws a screaming fit if there isn't at least a splash of milk. 

We have tried, it seems, everything-- we've done sleep training, from gentle methods (me staying in the room and soothing, etc.) to the cry-it-out method, straight from the Ferber book. It seems like we've been attempting sleep training of one kind or another for literally the past 2 years straight. When we do the full on cry-it-out method it works for like a week, and then he'll skip a nap and we're right back where we started with him waking up again, I'm assuming from being overtired. If he misses a nap he'll wake up at night. If he naps even 20 minutes too long or an hour too late in the day he'll wake up. If he's teething, has a cold, misses me at night, if the window is too open or too closed, or if his sister makes noises in the room next door he'll wake up.

He's speech delayed, and a total extrovert, so I know that part of it is the inability to get all of his energy out during the day when we're stuck at home due to COVID and also the inability to reason him back to sleep. I would do more cry it out, but  and his screaming wakes up his sister and my partner and and honestly, I don't think I can handle it anymore-- he is incredibly stubborn about it, and simply refuses to sleep if I'm not there, sometimes for literally hours. At this point the bottle seems the easiest way to just get him back in his bed, but I'm so tired of being awake for 20-30 minutes twice a night to do that. I'm exhausted. I try to take him in bed with me to just go back to sleep, but this just wakes him up more, and he'll be playing with the blankets, climbing everywhere. 

So, hit me with all of your tips, tricks, advice, literally anything. At this point I'm pretty sure I'll be sending him back to bed with a bottle when he's headed off to college. Help.

We are trying to be as cautious as possible. We socially distance, wear masks, avoid crowds, etc. I want to keep his classmates and teachers healthy.

We’ve been calling his doctor when he has cold symptoms, but the doctor always recommends he gets tested. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t really want to get him tested and keep him home for a week every time he has a runny nose. It’s extremely disruptive to my work and, most importantly, it’s really hard for him to constantly readjust. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for, just thoughts on what others are doing. I don’t want to be the parent who gets everyone sick, but I also don’t want to constantly pull my son out of class when he has a stuffy nose, or coughs, or seems a little fussy, etc.

I wanted to see if others share my same method.

note that I am speaking here of a child who would be at least two or three years old, not an infant.

when changing a child's disposable diaper, I am right handed. therefore, are usually form a capital T shape between my body and the child. in other words, I will usually stand on one side of the bed/surface and the child will be lying perpendicular to me. since I am right handed, their head will usually be to my left, and their feet/toes will be pointed to my right side. so if you can picture this, when cleaning them, I lift their legs up into my left toward their chest.

I tend to find having them lying perpendicular to me it is a lot more comfortable for me.

I am told that a lot of parents/caregivers do not do it this way. my best friend actually has the child lying parallel to them. so, their head is facing away from them, and their toes are pointed straight out toward my friends chest. forming more of a straight vertical line shape.

i've seen it done both ways, but I just don't see how one could get the angle correct having the child be parallel.

I frequently got so frustrated with her clinginess that I lost my temper.  I was feeling stressed because I was expecting another baby, and wasn't sure how to cope with it all.  

I'm here to report that it got a lot better, and to give other moms with clingy kids some encouragement.  

The first year of my new baby's life was really hard.  My first child still wanted all of my attention.  My second was happy to play by herself or to flip through a book while on my lap, so my first child was successful in sucking up all my attention.  The only real memories I have of my second child's first year are from when my first kid was napping.   I'm really sad about this, to be honest.  But I'm not really sure what I could have changed.  My first child learned to recognize when I was about to lose my temper, and would leave me alone if I was about to blow (but not until then), but that tended to mean that my second kid walked into a primed bomb.  It was still kind of miserable, and I still felt like a bad mom.   
 
This all started to really change about 8 months ago.  My younger child got old enough to play with the elder, and it was amazing.  Now, my mornings consist of only intermittent interacting with my children, instead of constant haranguing, and I love it.  I also feel like I can give my second kid more attention, as I'm not constantly emotionally tapped out.

My younger kid's naptimes are the most difficult part of my day.  I've instituted ""Mommy's break time.""  The older is to leave me alone for an hour after the younger has gone to sleep, then we'll do something together.  This goes less well.  Often, she will sit next to me, bored, and attempt to get my attention.  She usually refuses to play alone.  I often have to send her to her room to get a true break.  

My elder child also balks at being away from the house without me.  She was upset with me for days after attending a friend's birthday party I didn't stay for, despite me telling her beforehand I was dropping her off.  I want to sign her up for a once a week program, but she says she doesn't want to be away from me.  It's frustrating.

I would say our relationship is still more difficult than I would like.  She still has really intense needs (wants?  It's hard to know.  I'm sure she perceived them as needs), and we still occasionally get into patterns where I feel smothered and she feels ignored, but I don't lose my temper anymore.  It's not because I changed, though that was what I was hoping for two and a half years ago, it's because the circumstances around me changed and made it easier to parent my challenging child.

It’s hard to “teach in the moment” when he’s off the rails like that, and after the fact he doesn’t seem to care? I know that sounds awful- but it’s like he’s like yeah whatever, mom lol

Example: His daycare has this amazing full size wooden train for the kids to play on- because of COVID it’s off limits and they just want parents to redirect the kids instead of putting up barriers. My son loves this train- LOVES IT. I get it, it’s not fair!!
His classroom is directly in front of this train and he knows it- when we go to leave he refuses to be carried because he can do it himself- he’ll hold my hand until we get to the door- then he BOLTS for the train.
If I hold his hand forcefully I’m afraid I’ll dislocate his arm because this boy is STRONG. So I do the best I can but he gets away.
I talk to him about it and try to get him to follow me out- it’s a hot mess and I’m embarrassed as my kid is SCREAMING and going boneless when I try to pick him up. I try again and he starts yelling “OW! OW OW OW OW OW!!”
I’m mortified- he’s never done this! I’m not hurting him, but I’m afraid people think iam since he’s yelling OW!
I manage to get him out of the daycare kicking and screaming to have him go boneless again so I put him down- he RUNS away laughing- I’m yelling STOP NO FREEZE like we’ve been talking about, but it’s now a game.
I finally get him and carry him to the car kicking and screaming- he’s trying to smack me/hit me/kick me in protest and I finally get him in the car seat.
We drive 2 feet and then he’s fine and says “hi” with a smile.

The temperature control is on the bottom and is a nob....it was turned to off. None of us adults would have done that, so it obviously was him. Our kitchen is gated off but he knows how to open it and must have done it at some point between dinner and bedtime last night.

so our daughter is coming 18months, that last couple weeks we've let TV into her schedule because she's exhausting, she seemed interested and also old enough.  Also, I saw a post here about several shows that are basically designed to help them learn before schooltime.

We let her have about 45minutes in the morning (which we've since removed due to our concerns in her behaviour.). She wants baby bum or dave and ava on youtube which is basically nursery rhymes.

While watching, her eyes are basically glazed over and she's not very responsive or interactive.  I definitely think it has helped with her learning of numbers etc but when it comes time to turn it off, she usually gets a warning or two about what's going to happen.  Usually we get a 'nooooo' or something and plough on.

This morning for example, she was crying, screaming no and generally writhing around.  She takes a bit of calming down and then is demanding milk from her mum (we're assuming this is for comfort because she's upset or that she's just lost watching tv and doesn't realise she's hungry.)

Has anyone had similar to this?  I'd like to keep some short sittings in every couple days at least but her attachment/reaction and behaviour while watching has me a little spooked.

Do any other parents here have experience with their toddler possibly having a Sensory Processing Disorder? I would love to hear from other parents that have dealt with something similar and would love to know if you have any advice. I feel kind of lost.

My son is 18 months. I've known there was something going on with him since he was at least a year (his cousin of the same age was way more advanced in language, communication, and play) but his pediatrician at the time was about to retire and was very dismissive (I got the whole ""you're a first time mom, calm down, he's probably fine"" spiel). I got the same thing from family and tried to let things go and not worry. I brought up my concerns at his 15 month and the pediatrician we saw said it was too early to set up speech and language interventions and that all children develop at different rates. Anyway, fast forward to the 18 month check up- We'd since moved across the country and his new pediatrician immediately put through four referrals for evaluations for hearing, speech, OT, and to a developmental pediatrician. 

I'm happy that my son has a pediatrician that is taking things seriously, but man, this is overwhelming. I feel like we went from 0-60 all of the sudden. I spoke to a developmental pediatrician on the phone today and did a screener with her. She sounded pretty alarmed by some of my son's behaviors and she suspects he has some type of sensory processing issue (along with the speech and language delay). Me and my husband have been thinking the same thing and my husband has noise issues and I have some tactile issues, so it's not a huge surprise. There are certain sounds (like a cow mooing and certain harmonizing in songs) that make my son terrified. He also is obsessed with touching other children, which makes going to the playground hard in the midst of social distancing and it makes me really worried about his ability to make friends as he gets older. The issue at the moment is that all the various people we need to schedule evaluations with are booked out like crazy and hard to get ahold of. Also the developmental pediatrician wants us to find him some friends to play with but we're new to the area and are still in quarantine mode. I'm feeling kind of alone and would love to hear from other parents. I feel like I want to help my son while we're waiting for evaluations and services to get started, but I have no idea where to start. Woo!

I would just make her mini versions of whatever the rest of us were eating and she would never refuse anything. Fast  forward to her turning 2, seemingly overnight the only thing she wants to eat is French fries and noodles, occasionally chicken. She still will eat broccoli and corn, her favorite vegetables sometimes but she is pretty much refusing everything else she used to eat. She prefers to just snack which I give her relatively healthy snacks like tomatoes, cheese, fruits, and the occasional bowl of goldfish. I do not want to start cooking her something she will eat while the rest of the family eats something different or more complex. I don’t wanna get her stuck on like chicken nuggets and fries, which is the only thing my 9 year old sister will eat to this day. That is my worst nightmare. How can I broaden her pallet again?

Now, a while ago she pushed him from a chair and his head almost hit a sharp corner. Now I'm quite annoyed, but I can't do anything, if it was my son doing this I know the levers to push and make him regret his actions. With this girl I have no leverage and she continues to operate in this mode. 
I am quite disappointed and sad, I am thinking maybe I shouldn't invited her over again ( on one side) and on the other side thinking of giving punishments and building leverage on her ( I don't know if I have the authority of teaching somebody else's kids manners and even if so how far can I go). Overall i am feeling very bad.

Just a question I am hoping to get a perspective on.

I have a 22 month old daughter, and my wife is starting to be concerned that we will need to see a speech pathologist.  Currently, she is saying 23 words regularly, but has spoken many others either once or for a brief period of time.  She definitely understands what we are saying to her or asking her her to do, just doesn't seem to want to speak.  She is a very efficient at pointing to get to what she wants.

I think it may be a confidence thing.  If you ask her to say a word at normal volume, most often she doesn't try.  But if you whisper to her, you can see her trying to form the words with her lips and sometimes you can hear her trying to make the sounds.

Is this something that is to be expected?  Any advice on trying to get her to try more words?

My 3 year old has been resisting pooping in the potty for a while now. And he hates getting his butt wiped to the point that he was going out of his way not to tell us and just tried to poop in his shorts even though he was right in front of us.

We never thought it would end. It was painful and has lead to more than one power struggle.

But a few days ago we were at Target, and he saw a bag of M&amp;Ms and asked for them. I decided to use it as a motivational tool and told him we would get them, but he would only get M&amp;Ms when he pooped in the potty, 1 for trying, 5 for succeeding.

So today I was standing in the kitchen getting food for the cat when my husband and son come downstairs and my husband is telling our 3 year old he will give him an M&amp;M for sitting on the potty.

3 year old sits on the potty and gets an M&amp;M, then promptly decides one is not enough. So he asks for more and we tell him that he can't have any more until he poops in the potty.

Son disappears into the bathroom and my husband and I don't think much of it. I feed the cat and start filling the soda stream bottles when our son announces ""I pooped in the potty!""

I look at my husband skeptically and go to investigate and sure enough, there it is. An almost man-sized poop sitting in the toilet.

We were thrilled; we partied and 3 year old got way more than 5 M&amp;Ms. He is currently bouncing off the walls from all the sugar, but I truly feel like we finally hit a turning point with this whole potty training thing and I pray it continues to go this way. \*fingers crossed!\*",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,78332,public,self,3 year old FINALLY pooped in the potty!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/j1mh1a/3_year_old_finally_pooped_in_the_potty/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I was reading an article discussing ways to build self esteem and confidence in our kids. Specifically for toddlers it explained that we shouldn’t discourage them from climbing and exploring (in appropriate locations like the park) due to our own fears. And the way they explained it has made a huge difference in both my toddlers’ (3&amp;4yo) within a week or less. So instead of discouraging them from climbing too high or attempting something they see the older kids do that might be too advanced, ask them what their plan is or, what are they going to do after they take another step higher. So I started doing this right away when my adventurous 3yo would get brave. I wouldn’t stop him, u would ask him “so you got up that high, now make a plan to get down. Then suggest places to put their feet and so on. This way of encouraging critical thinking has changed both of my kids entire outlook on life outside of home. And after they complete a big task without your help you could see the bells in their brains make the connection. They were so proud of themselves that they have implemented this “so what’s your plan?” Advice in other areas. It took maybe 4 trips to the park and my kids gained a sense of self confidence that i am so proud of. Since then the whining and unsure behavior has all but stopped. It has made my household a more calm place. I wish everyone the best.

I also worry about a time where she would not sleep, no matter what we would do she would be up all night and would flail and scream and cry when we put her in her bed for hours and hours. So I would bear hug her until she calmed down, because she would sometimes hurt her self throwing her head back against the wall or jumping off her bed on accident. 

I never questioned my parenting being too much before this pretending has happened but now I worry that I have messed her up and given her anxiety or some disorder😭 I can’t help but feel like I am doing things wrong.

So with the pretending, it started around spring time, she was pretending to be a dog, and his name is buster puppy. To get her to do anything while she was pretending we have to address her as such. This wasn’t super offer maybe once a day being short lived. Fast forward to now it is almost always all day long, she has a range of different characters most recently being “fancy” I am pregnant and was really struggling with sickness in the beginning and going to the doctors a lot. This resulted in a huge change or pace in our house, so I think this could also have an affect on her as well. 

But she get extremely upset if we do not call her who she is “pretending” to be, sometimes she doesn’t even know. She will not settles down until we say okay, or okay fancy or whoever she is. She is never herself, and I think the only time she is “herself” is when I adress her as ruby and she maybe forgets or is to distracted to realize I called her by her name and not who she wants to be. I was pretty worried about this last week, I relaxed and came to the conclusion that she is just very bright for her age, and will grow out of it. But last night we were all laying in bed together, she couldn’t sleep because we had a small road trip back home right before bed which she was asleep for in the car. She was looking at the ceiling saying that ruby is stuck there, after I was trying to explain that when mom and dad talk to you and say ruby we need to talk to Ruby. She would not accept and was puppy until she fell asleep. But before sleep she was talking. About knifes and something on the ceiling, I reminded her that knives are only for food, and she went on to pretending that she was just picking food and cutting it. 

Also around the time she started pretending she started picking her nails which has got a little better. 

She pretends in a lot of different ways too, about places and things, really about anything.

So I don’t want to overly worry about this because sometimes she just seems to be having fun I don’t want to disrupt that. But I really am starting to get worried that she is never herself, and that ruby is “over there” being invisible, and that she is someone else all the time. I’m worried she’ll start to fully believe it and develop some sort or identity disorder. Which led me to google which led me to think that I have done something wrong that has affected her 😭😭😭 

Should I bring her to a psychologist, I really feel like that is too much for a child her age but I am so worried and I don’t want to mess anything up and make her not want to be herself even more, or just to know that truly that pretending at this length is in fact normal 😣",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,78314,public,self,My almost 3yo daughter and her pretending,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/j1j8ua/my_almost_3yo_daughter_and_her_pretending/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

My 3 year old has finally been fully potty trained in the last month. We've had some issues with him playing in the sink instead of just washing his hands so we moved his little potty outside of the bathroom. 


So a little earlier today my son goes and says he has to potty. He uses it and takes one of the most massive duece logs I've ever seen from him. He tries to run off without wiping or dumping the specimen into the real potty and flushing it. I help him wipe and then his 1 year old sister starts crying from the other room. I run to check on her while son is washing his hands. Then son comes and asks for his reward for going potty, then it's time to put sister down for nap.


I come out from putting her down for nap and remember that we never got rid of his impressive bowel candy from earlier. I go to take care of it but it's gone. I ask my son if he dumped it in the potty and he said no. I look around horrified that there's no this brown monstrosity lurking somewhere in our house probably smooshed into the carpet.

My son is roughly around 2.5 years old and we introduced him to the potty but on my wife &amp; I we wasn’t as consistent. He’s currently in pull ups and sometimes when he uses the restroom in them, he says “Pee pee” lol (which means either he pooped or peed). So when we randomly decide to put him on his potty , he doesn’t want to use the restroom . He did a few months ago first thing in the morning but after while when i say come potty he takes off running and crying. So what approach did you take for potty training? Any advice or suggestions.

She isn't showing any readiness for toilet training so please don't suggest this as a solution :-)

Over the last few months all diaper changes have become progressively more difficult. I've employed the strategies I picked up reading various books but nothing works. Not holding my phone, the tablet, toy, FaceTime with my mom, talking nicely, etc. She has sensitive skin so she can't sit in a soiled diaper for too long. The few times I've let her sit with a poop and told her ""let me know when you're ready to clean your bum"" she will just never be ready. I talk her through it in a nice voice, make silly voices, ask her what wrong,etc. My strategies are successful about 2 out of 10 times. 

So now whenever it's time to change her, she screams, flails around, gets so upset she's choking on her own tears. It takes two of us to change her through force. She screams to not have her pants and diaper taken off, then once they're off and she's clean she screams to stay naked and not have a clean diaper and pants put back on. She screams ""no!"" so loudly I'm afraid CPS is going to be called on us.

This also happens when it's time to change from PJs into daytime clothes or daytime clothes into PJs.

I'm at my wit's end and truly dislike being a parent when this happens and I'm struggling to work through it. I'm in my bedroom cooling off from the diaper change we just did because there was a moment when I wanted to spank her (we don't do that, and I'm ashamed to admit the thought crossed my mind) and I knew I needed to walk away.

Is this developmental? Did someone hurt her (she goes to daycare 2 days a week so now my mind is going into overdrive)? What am I doing wrong? Does this happen to everyone and I just need to trudge on?

I had never priced the Elecare formula until today and it is $42.44 PER CAN and I mean just ONE can. I need to get a can as soon as possible because she has to eat every three hours and I have 41 minutes til it's time. you guys I have asked ally friends and family for help and no one can help. I went to my local social services and talked to a worker about help and she called food banks and things for charity and NO ONE has the Elecare formula. Local churches turned us down and said they had no funds and couldn't help. I have cried all afternoon and night and begged God to send help and idk I am losing hope. I feel like such a useless mother that has failed her daughter. She has to eat and it's very important for her because her being a preemie and still tiny she has to grow. So I'm asking for help! Yes I said it..I know I will get bashed and talked shit to but everyone told me that I should never be afraid to ask for help for my children and etc. Well here I am and hope and pray that someone will help my boy out so I can rest easy. I'm just tore up inside not knowing what to do. If any one could help us to get the Elecare for my daughter to be able to eat o will be so grateful and couldn't thank you enough. Please God send help! My information is:

Two nights ago I messaged my husband that I didn't want to do it anymore. Then both boys (2yo and 2mo sharing a room) were screaming instead of sleeping. 

But today, my 2yo made me laugh by nursing his lovey. He even made it burp. And the lovey needed a diaper, so he got the diaper holder from his daycare bag and wiped its bum with a wet wipe and tried to stick it in a new diaper. It looked professional! 

Then he layed down himself and told me he needed a new diaper too. So I changed a lovely poopy diaper without fuss (that's rare!).

Later he removed his pants and diaper himself and sat on the potty. He knows what the potty is for and how it's used, but he rarely wants to go himself. He didn't want to put a diaper or trousers on after. And when we sat down for lunch he told me he needed to go potty. So he did. And then he wanted a diaper, because lunch with a naked bum was silly, I guess.

After lunch he wanted to go upstairs and went to bed without any fuss. Timing aligned, so our baby went to bed too. Without nursing, without crying. It's a win!

He slept for a good two hours and we played outside for a bit after.

At dinner he wasn't fussy and ate his meat, some potatoes and even got him to try a brussels sprout.

Bedtime went quite well too. I'd love more days like this. I'll treasure this one for a while.

Anyhow, we are currently seeking autism evaluations at the regional medical centers (in MD, Kennedy Krieger, National Children's Hospital, and Mt. Washington).

**Kennedy Kreiger and National Children's Hospital'****s** evaluations appear to be very comprehensive, as it is an evaluation by a team (SLP, Occupational Therapist, and Clinical Psychologist):  

SLP will evaluate your child’s expressive and receptive language and social interaction. The SLP will use structured and semi-structured assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations to evaluate your child's speech and language. Information gathered from the evaluation will help the SLP determine your child’s strengths and deficits, and thus develop recommendations for enhancing the child’s language and interaction.

Occupational Therapist (OT) will assess your child’s gross motor, fine motor, visual motor, visual perceptual, oral and sensory processing skills. The use of standardized and non-standardized assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations will be used to assess your child’s patterns of strength and need that impact daily performance of functional tasks. Recommendations will be provided for home, school and community implementation.

clinical psychologist: Following the evaluation with the SLP and OT, you and your child will meet with a clinical psychologist. The psychologist will conduct a clinical interview to obtain information about your child’s birth and developmental history, medical history, and social and behavioral history. The psychologist will also perform a standardized evaluation of your child's play, behavior, and social skills. Information collected during the interview, intake information gathered prior to your visit, evaluation, behavioral observations of your child, and results from the assessments with SLP will be reviewed in order to provide diagnostic impressions and information related to behavioral/psychological functioning. The clinical psychologist will provide recommendations regarding additional interventions or follow-up services that may be beneficial for your child.

  


Unfortunately, with those two hospitals, the current wait time is 6-10 months for in-person evaluations.  We had a consultation with a Pediatric Psychologist from Mt Washington last week and was told that Mt Washington offers telemed evaluation, instead of a team of specialists it will just be the Pediatric Psychologist, having us parents interact with our boy following her instructions while she observes over the laptop camera.   

&amp;#x200B;

Our question right now is should we do the telemed evaluation by a pediatric psychologist or wait for an in-person evaluation by a team?  The psychologist said SLP/OT arent really necessary for an autism diagnosis since cognitive/language issues isnt part of the autism diagnosis.  Instead, it is based on two areas - social communication and any restricted/repetitive patterns or interests.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since our 24mo is starting speech therapy soon, even without the diagnosis, we were wondering if we should wait or get an evaluation asap via telemed.  What do you all think?

Aside from the basics (first aid, water, folding chairs, extra snacks, tons of wipes, books, sound machine, flashlights/lanterns, etc), and fun stuff like s’mores and glow sticks, any other things I should keep in mind that I may not have thought of yet?

-frequently does not respond to name when engrossed/really interested in something else 
-has recently developed a pretty keen fascination with things that spin
-has begun crossing fingers in a strange way, particularly when anxious...also, holds arms up at chest level, bent at the elbow with fingers postured while walking
-flaps arms when excited, mad, anxious (for a couple of seconds at a time, not prolonged and can be distracted out of it)

-loves playing with strings

My son (2) started daycare a couple of weeks ago, and currently he's only there from 9-12 because I am 95% sure he won't have good naps there. So I prefer him to come home and have his nap at home. A bunch of our friends had kids start daycare recently too, and they all say their kids either don't nap there at all some days, or only sleep for 30 minutes (where they'd usually sleep 2-3 hours at home). There's a chart on the wall detailing the times of each kids naps, and I can see that naps there are generally pretty bad. 

I've always had a lot of anxiety around my son's sleep, probably a relic from the baby stage, and I've always been really really protective about his naps. I get really worried at the idea that he might have bad naps 5 days a week, and wondering how that would translate to his naps on the weekends, and his nighttime sleep, and generally his mood and development throughout the rest of the day/week.

Ideally I'd like to extend the time he's at daycare so that I can get some things done, and have him take his nap there, but I'm terrified that if he fails to nap well at daycare it'll affect all his naps from here on, as well as his nighttime sleep and mood.

I am a father of 2 year 4 month old and a little nervous about going through an autism diagnosis here in Ontario, Canada. At 2 year old during regular visit, I went to his pediatrician when I told her he isn't still speaking alot and at the time I noticed he was pacing (walking in circles). 

During this pandemic both me and my wife are working from home and have decided to stop his daycare since he was falling sick twice with viral every month and we didnt want to take the risk of covid panic. So when both me and wife were in meeting for working, we started noticed he would get bored and start pacing.

That said, today, my son is able to speak more than 50 words (note we are bilingual) so he speaks a few words in our native and others mostly english. He doesnt yet speaks in sentences. The only sentence I remember him saying is ""daddy sit"". 

He loves sitting with a book and pointing things calling out names of things (sheep, cow, sun, apple etc). I cannot say numbers or letters yet. He points out to stuff he needs, he says ""stairs"" if he wants to go downstairs or upstairs. Loves his screen time watching rhymes but we limit that to some extent. I just hate the fact his development is most likely affected because we dont have enough time to spend with him and are scared to send him to daycare due to pandemic which I am debating now.

Yesterday, when we visited his ped for noticing white marks in his nail thinking maybe he has some deficiency (which we were told its nothing), our doctor was more focused on autism. Now what she was telling me was not staring at her when she was talking to my child combined with delayed speech are sign of autism. Of course, I am not in denial and I will go through with the diognosis but I am still questioning her method of her diagnosis. There was a nurse with whom my son was interacting, giving hi-fi when asked, he even spread his arms to take him in her arms and all while making eye contact (not litterally staring tho). 

At home, or places he is never shy. If anyone is being a little friendly and says ""outside"" he will be ready to hold you hands and walk out with you doesnt matter who you are. As a parent, I am genenuinely nervous about his development. His diagnosis is scheduled on 2nd October and I am really hoping it comes out he has nothing like that. 

I post this here to ask how were your kids at this age and what you think of this situation? Is it really that bad of 2 year old toddler not speaking and staring in your eyes if you talk to them etc.

Good morning ,

So I have an almost 2.5 year old son who throws a tantrum for nearly anything lol. Yes , I’m aware this is what most children his age do but I would love to hear your way of approaching your child when they throw a tantrum. Normally when I tell him “No” about anything , he cries and lay on the ground throwing a tantrum. It seems as if it gets worse by the day unfortunately. Usually I tell him no over and over and it gets worse and worse . So I usually go to the “old school” approach and tap/spank him on his leg or pull up. I honestly don’t spank him a lot but i really do not want to whatsoever or make that be my last last resort. So I was curious to know of ways you usually stop your toddler from throwing a tantrum. In addition, he still breastfeeds for comfort and for
Him to sleep. Is not a huge issue however that’s the “quick fix” of calming him down or him going to sleep at night or taking a nap. Not to mention, my wife and I just had a baby 5 days ago and she’s breastfeeding as well. So any advice about ways of having toddler overcoming tantrum besides spanking would be greatly appreciated.

A little context before I bombard you with questions: My boyfriend's older brother and son (2 1/2 years old) just moved in with him. In the past month, my boyfriend has assumed the 'second parent' role that he wasn't necessarily prepared for. My boyfriend wanted to help out his brother in a time of transition and financial need. He's awesome with his nephew - gentle, kind, loves to play and teach him new things. He's spoken with his brother about boundaries, but still isn't quite sure where he lands on the 'uncle-parenting' spectrum. Currently, my boyfriend is working on potty training and expanding his nephew's very limited vocabulary (he has under 50 words and can't yet communicate when he needs to go to the bathroom which is making potty training difficult). I love them all and really just want to see their living situation be successful.

My questions are (any and all answers appreciated!):

* How can my partner set boundaries with his brother?
* How can I best support my partner?
* How did you encourage your toddler to speak?
* How do you know when to seek out a speech eval?
* Potty training - is it too soon to start?

Im sorry if this gets really long, I’m just processing it all and really beating myself up. I’m struggling with my day care provider who for the most part I like, but she’s very old school and sometimes we don’t see eye to eye on certain things. 

I should probably preface by explaining that my daughter who is 3, is suspected to be on the spectrum or have ADHD and we’ve been in the process of having her evaluated but the process is taking for freaking ever. It’s been almost two years now since we started the process, it’s ridiculous. 

So anyway, my daughter goes to day care twice a week simply for the social aspect of it and our day care lady -let’s call her Judy- has commented on how my daughter should be doing certain things for her age. She should be using a regular cup at her age. She should be putting her shoes on correctly. She’s called her “flighty” because she likes to bounce from one activity to another. Whatever. These are things that I’ve tried working with her on but she has no interest so I don’t push it. However, I’m so very proud of her because after we have struggled with potty training for over a year now (and I didn’t want to push her), she is finally potty trained aside from while she’s sleeping or in the car. She does amazing and has even started going #2 on the toilet and I am SO proud of her. 

So recently, Judy has expressed frustrations about my daughter coming in to day care with a “saturated” (her exact words) pull up. So I cut back my daughters juice intake first thing in the morning to try and help with this. However, I like to make sure she has plenty to drink first thing in the morning before she goes to day care because I know she won’t get much to drink while she’s there because of the cup situation I mentioned previously. So, obviously.. she is wet by the time we get there but I wouldn’t call it saturated. 

Now, this is super confusing to my kiddo because any other day of the week, she doesn’t wear a pull up or diaper except at bed/nap time and in the car. But Judy says I can’t send her to day care without a pull up until she’s fully potty trained. My child doesn’t understand that a pull up is not actually a diaper. As long as she’s wearing it, she will pee in it. It’s that simple. Lately, the mornings that we go to day care, my kiddo says she wants to wear “shark undies” and I try to explain that she has to wear the pull up to go to day care but that she can still go potty on the toilet while she’s there. She gets upset because she doesn’t want to wear the pull up and this morning was upset when she wet her pull up as we were heading inside day care. 

So what am I supposed to do?? Judy wants her in a pull up while she’s there, but yet if she arrives in a wet pull up, Judy is annoyed. My daughter doesn’t need to go potty on the toilet first thing in the morning because she’s already gone in her diaper all night. It’s not until after she’s had her morning juice (which I have cut back on) that she needs to go potty which just so happens to be about the time we are in the car on the way to day care or right when we get there. Judy says she has kiddo sit on the toilet for up to three minutes at a time and she usually doesn’t go potty and just gets upset. Well yeah!!  She’s in a pull up so she’s going potty in that and no longer has to go so you’re just making her sit still on the toilet for three minutes which probably just feels like a time out at that point! I don’t know what to do here. I’ll also add that the only reason Judy even tries to have kiddo go on the toilet is because I was concerned about the number of pull ups I was having to send and asked if she was using the toilet while she was there. Judy said no, kiddo had no interest but that she could give it a try after I explained that kiddo is potty trained at home. I didn’t know that meant no opportunity to try without a pull up and having to sit on the toilet for several minutes. Because at home, she just goes in the bathroom and goes when she needs to go. She doesn’t even require any help from me unless she has pooped. 

Maybe I’m in the wrong, but I know my kid. She’s hard to communicate with sometimes because she doesn’t always understand directions but I always try anyway and she eventually catches on, it just takes her a tad longer than some kids and that’s ok. We work with her. 

Anyway! I’m so sorry for the ramble and if my thoughts seem scattered. I hope it all makes sense. I’m just feeling like a crappy mom because this lady makes me feel like there are so many things I’m doing wrong and now when I thought we had made great progress with something, it feels like it’s being taken away because it’s not enough or something. She makes me feel like my kid is “that kid” that she doesn’t like having around. But it also feels like she’s limiting my child because I know her abilities and she doesn’t get to express them while she’s there. So yeah.

So this is 2nd hand story.

I was induced 9/22 so my two girls were with the grandparents. My 4yr old with my parents and 2yr old with my MIL.

The 2yr old learned how to climb out of the crib the day she turned 17mths. Living with my MIL we were not prepared to switch her to a toddler bed though we tried. So we purchased a mesh crib tent where the mattress fits inside and you zip them in to prolong their time in the crib.

Yesterday during her nap time she somehow got out and came looking for grandma. She had no idea how she escaped.

My SO was able to go home last night and return today. He wanted to see how she escaped. 

So while he was in the shower this morning the 2yr old came into the bathroom. She had still been in the crib. He changed her diaper and put her back in so he could watch how she escaped.

The little sh$t unzipped the tent from the inside and climbed out. But she didn't stop there. She climbed back up and zipped the flap up. When she got to the end she couldn't get it all the way up so she planted a foot on the mattress and put her knee on the rail of the crib to completely zip it up!

Part of me is amazed but the other part is cursing 🤬 up a storm because now we have to deal with an escape artist as well as a newborn. We have baby gates on the bedroom doors as our rooms are connected by the bathroom.

His first day seemed great but subsequent days were less than.

As an overly anxious parent however, I have done as much research as I can on car seat safety. I’ve watched manufacture videos of front/side/back collisions on my make and model of vehicle. I read both my owners manual and car seat manual for instillation and I always have my local health department double check the seat is installed correctly. I’m aware that none of this qualifies me as an expert, I’m still a layperson when it comes to knowledge about car safety. Always read your owners and car seat manuals to make sure the seat can be installed in the middle. This is just my personal antidote. I’m also aware that the middle seat might not always be possible, especially for those with multiple children. 

I’ve always had car seats in the middle, but since my two and a half year old moved to forward facing in my 2008 Honda CR-V, I decided to put him on the passengers side in the back because the anchor system in the middle seat requires the third anchor to be hooked on the ceiling instead of the back of the seat like most models allow for. I figured this would increase the likelihood the seat would loosen over time making me have to readjust/tighten it constantly, and that the belt would be in the way of my trunk space so I decided the side would be the best option.

Getting onto the accident: My significant other was driving and my toddler (THANK GOD) was staying at grandmas house for the weekend as we decided to take a much needed socially distanced trip just the two of us. A women in a mini van pulled out of a parking lot full force, impacting the back passenger side door (again, the door the car seat is at). The side/curtain airbags were deployed in both the front and back seat and the car spun around in the middle of the road, and it ended with us facing the direction we were coming from. 

My first thought was that my arm was broken. The side airbag hit it hard. Luckily I’m fine, we got X-rays. It’s just bruised and swollen today. My second thought was to look in the back seat. The curtain airbag did not hit the side of the car seat like I assumed it would (we all have those little head protectors that protect the sides of the head built into the seat), but instead came down from above and slightly to the side — right where my toddlers head would’ve been. The car seat would NOT of been between the airbag and his head in this case. As a nurse, nothing terrifies me more than pediatric traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure. And there’s no doubt in my mind we would’ve been life flighted to the nearest pediatric ICU for head trauma or a broken neck had he been on the car. I was so livid at this women. I was even more pissed off when she tried to blame her actions on a parked truck for blocking the view, but there’s a difference between inching out and pulling out full force. I understand things happen sometimes, but based on where she impacted us it’s clear we were right in front of her, I mean the front half of the car was passed her already. My car will likely be totaled.

Again, just my personal antidote. Ive always read middle is safest and it makes sense to me. I’ve also had my health department verify this. I’m trying not to kick myself over “what-if’s” but it’s hard not to when your child’s life could’ve been at stake. 

Some tips: 
-Car seats are deemed ineffective after being an accident. This is why it’s important not to purchase used car seats, as you never know if it’s been in one or not. I will be purchasing a new one. 

-Manufactures have videos of accident safety tests on your make/model available to the public. I believe there’s a government website I found this on (United States) but I do not remember the site name.

-Always read both the owners manual and seat manual for proper instructions for instillation. 

-See if your local health department has a car seat instillation program where someone who is trained will help you install your seat or check that it is installed correctly. 

I know we are all trying are best as parents so I hope this doesn’t worry anyone with multiple car seats or who can put on in the middle. If anyone has anything else to add about car safety, please feel free to do so! I’m always open to learning more.

She's 3 in January (2.5, 33 months, almost 3, etc) she is my 3rd and has been the WORST to potty train, but we are getting there. 

So she is doing this thing. Using her bed as her toilet. So, here is our saga... 

Our daughter does not nap, but likes to do all her sleeping at night. And she wakes up late morning, and then is sneaky quiet as she plays in her room. If I get her up RIGHT when she wants to get up she is a tantruming mess ALL DAY. Please know, I am not joking. She will literally have a non stop meltdown from the time she gets up, till she goes down, with breaks to eat, and breathe. So, I watch her the best I can pandemic schooling the 2 older brothers. 

And usually 30 or so min after she wakes, I can go get her. But she ALWAYS urinates on her bed/bedding by the time I get her. 30 min is how far I had widdled the time to. Her pedi is ok with her sleeping in since she doesn't nap (go me!) 

Hopefully you follow me. 

So, we began dressing her in clothes she can't get out of. She can undress herself. Backwards jammies be damned. She must have a gnome friend living in her doll house or something... idk man. She gets out of there. She escapes everything. 

We have placed an extra potty in there WITH this neat little potty bag that has an absorbent pad inside it. (I frankly don't trust her not to spill it, little potty has a locking top she hasn't figured out yet... but there is still time..... )

She goes potty in said potty, she uses it.. and THEN pees on her bedding. 

We have cut out sippys of water at night (all my kids have slept with water) and cut back the last sippy of water she gets (no juice or milk for her) so. By 10:30 am (when I get her) she gas not had any liquids since 6pm (the end of dinner) save the delicacy of soapy bath water- hork. She probably drinks a good half gallon of water a day from when she gets up, to dinner. 

We have changed diaper brands. 

We have thought about duct taping the diaper to her, but she has no hips so I don't think it would work (and that whole not acceptable thing) 

She is my 3rd so OBVIOUSLY she wants me to feel as clueless as a parent as possible for the last Harrah. So can anyone provide me with solidarity as I try and keep up with her laundry, advice from your own delicate defeating demon, or even someone explain to me WHY my only daughter has been the absolute WORST to potty train OR is this connected? 

(Oh, and because its relevant we began potty training her later than her brothers... but she began withholding when wearing diapers and causing herself other issues due to the discomfort of using her diaper. We STILL have withholding problems, however its more of an issue for us to get her to relax long enough- not she is too young to train) 

TLDR: my spawn absolutely fills her size 6 diaper to the BRIM with pee, pees in a potty with an absorbent pad, AND THEN pees on her bedding (usually she has drug it onto the floor- or straight up on her sheets)

basically what the title says, he is severely sensitive to change, to the point of triggering meltdowns where he’s screaming and crying until the change is reverted. 

for example, when he was at the age of using a pacifer, whenever it would be replaced with a new one(because the old one was too small or broken), he would have a meltdown and stay awake all night until he had the old pacifier back. 

another example is that when he would have new shoes or socks, he would refuse to wear them and insist on wearing the old shoes, no matter how small they were. 

today, his father bought new diapers for him (a different brand than normal), and he refused to wear them. he held his bladder for hours, and began crying because it was becoming painful to hold it in. eventually he was forced into the diaper, and he immediately peed and had another meltdown. 

i’i can’t take him to a neurologist or a doctor, we don’t have any money and his parents are a neglectful (they hit him when he cries, they don’t take care of him and leave him to the oldest brother to. they don’t play with him and let him play on a mobile phone to keep him busy. he rarely gets to go out, only when the brother takes him out does he get to) 

if this is important, he also doesn’t know how to speak yet (he can speak as well as a one year old). his brother says that he has always been anxious of everything (people, games, anything non-familiar). he hurts himself badly when he’s angry as well.

Every day I struggle with guilt/pride over it.

To give you an idea of the schedule:

- wake-up and breakfast are with me (mom), and then we usually head outside for a park visit or bike ride. If it's bad weather, we go to his room and do stickers/puzzles/train sets/whatever he's into.
- lunch around 12:30pm, and after that he does quiet time in his room on his own until about 3pm. He used to nap between 1-3pm, but he stopped sleeping - out of necessity/wanting that break (I do freelance part time work and try to cram a lot of it in that time frame).
- after quiet time, he hangs out with me doing books, maybe another outdoor jaunt, or some potty training/puzzles/stickers until dinner (~6pm)
- after dinner we usually get him to tidy his room, and then he can watch some TV or play on his tablet for ~45mins, then it's bath and bed by 8:30.

I guess I'm wondering how this compares to other only children who aren't in daycare. I'm proud that he seems happy and content while playing on his own, but I'm also feeling like his dad and I are being shitty parents and just tapping out early because we can.

Terrible? Good development? Should I chill out on the guilt feelings? I find myself needing a lot of recharge, and so does my husband (although I think I'm better at powering through).

If it weren't for Covid I'd have him in more activities, but it's just not a safe option for us right now.

My daughter caught what we believed to be your proto-typical gastroenteritis virus about 4 weeks ago.  She had typical symptoms for 3 nights (vomiting, diarrhea, no fever) and recovered thereafter.  She went on for about 5 days without any symptoms at all and then had a recurrence of vomiting overnight.  This has gone on for the last month or so during which she will be completely fine for days at a time, then out of nowhere will throw up one night and the pattern will repeat (it has occurred 6 separate times now in the last 30 or so days).  I do want to note that she is acting completely 100% normal and energetic outside of these vomiting episodes.  Also, to clarify on the vomiting - she is spitting up very little food and mostly bile / saliva and each time that she has thrown up, it has happened overnight between 3 and 5 AM (leading me to believe this may be reflux or nausea at play).   With all that said, she has been examined by her doctor and all of her labs came back 100% normal.  Doctors at this point believe she could be constipated and needing to clear her system - we are monitoring her and she does a follow up visit in the next week.

On nap days, regardless of how early in the day it ended or how short it was, she sleeps late AF. Like 11pm late. When we skip her nap she goes down at a reasonable time (8ish). Sometimes she naps for 2.5 hours so I'm hesitant to drop it but damn I am so over these late nights.

We moved to temporary accommodation a month ago while we buy our next house. I decided to sit in the room with him while he went to sleep otherwise he would have been scared to be alone in the new room. Well a month later I’m still sitting here, except he will no longer go to sleep. If I ever try to leave he will become absolutely hysterical and I’m not prepared to leave him like that for long. 

I’ve tried putting him on 1 nap, which he goes to sleep for because he’s so tired but he’s waking up very upset after 40 mins and not going back to sleep. He will flat out not have a second nap even though he is so tired. 

Since we got back from holiday a week ago he won’t do bedtime either, just screams staring at me so I eventually give him another bottle of milk to reset him. After sometimes 3 or 4 goes on the bottle he’s eventually tired himself out enough to go to sleep. Maybe he’s overtired cause usually he’s been awake 6+ hours at this point because of missed naps. 

Up until this point I’ve been all about counting wake times, but I haven’t got a clue what they should be anymore as he’s not seeming to follow any of them. It also doesn’t help that I have no idea what time he wakes up in the morning as he lies there quietly for over an hour if left.

Last night, we put her in the tub, which she loves, and she immediately said she had to pee and wanted to go on the potty.  I was surprised, but I figured she was seeing other kids at daycare go so she was finally becoming interested in the potty.  So I pulled her out of the tub and sat her on her training potty.  Within 20 seconds she peed.  Dad and I celebrated, she got her sticker, and she was super happy.

BUT THEN...just a mere 10 seconds later, her smile turned to a full blown, open-mouthed, red face, teary-eyed wail.  She was crying, super upset, and we still have absolutely no idea why.  She was inconsolable.  We tried everything, and she didn’t want to get back in the tub, either.  This girl NEVER has meltdowns like that.  She’s very even-tempered and wel-behaved...for a toddler at least.

I yelled his name right in his face, and he immediately crumpled and started crying. He came right to me for a hug and I said I was so sorry, that is not okay for me to yell, and I hugged him tight. But the guilt is killing me and I feel like a monster.

Backstory leading up to it: 

He was following me around the house, screaming at the top of his lungs. He tends to do this for the first couple nights right before bedtime, after his dad leaves (my husband works out of town for a week at a time). I know my little one is having big feelings about dad being gone again, but good grief child, please stop screaming as loud as you can and following me around the house while you do it!! 

I try saying things like “Please stop screaming, that hurts my ears” several times with no luck. Then I get down on his level, and say things like “I need you to stop screaming now, I’m starting to feel upset” and ultimately getting to “I need to leave you here right now because I feel very upset by this screaming” and I leave the room to take some deep breaths. But that little bugger opens the door and FOLLOWS me, screaming his head off. When I look at his face, it’s like he knows exactly what he’s doing. He stops to listen when I say those things and then just start screaming again!

And so the third time he followed me into another room, I snapped and knelt down and yelled “Henry Oliver!!” right at him. 

I was screamed at by my father a lot growing up and I know that getting screamed at is a big trigger for me. I immediately start getting panicky when anyone yells at me (thankfully that hasn’t been very often until this toddler behaviour has cropped up). I’m very dedicated to breaking the cycle of trauma in my family and NOT yelling at my kids, so I feel extra bad about this incident. I’m working with my therapist on this, but holy smokes, I just want to know I’m not the only one who has snapped like this?

It takes 1.5-2hrs to get him down sometimes and it’s EXHAUSTING. He doesn’t pull this stunt during nap time, he goes down fairly quickly for that. My husband and I try hard to stick to a regular routine. Dinner, ideally some quiet time, milk, teeth brushing, potty, get pull ups on, read books/tell stories, turn on Hatch (white noise machine) then bed. He’s already in a big boy bed, so he can get out whenever he wants and he’s definitely been doing this more and more. He usually shrieks, cries and throws a fit as soon as my husband and I leave the room then eventually comes running back out after us. He always wants us to tell him another story, but one is never enough. We’ve tried eliminating stories altogether, letting him cry it out for a bit in his room (but then I always feel sickeningly guilty letting my 2.5 year old sob himself to sleep), we’ve tried talking about his feelings and explaining why mommy/daddy need to leave the room for bedtime, we’ve laid next to him until he falls asleep, we’ve tried leaving his door open all the way, cracked and closed, we’ve tried to let him read books to entertain himself until he crashes etc. We’ve tried a ton of things and nothing appeases him. He continues to hoot and holler like a wild animal once we leave. We’re feeling defeated. We get frustrated, not only with him but with each other. My husband is working full time and from home due to COVID. He starts a new MBA program in a week or so. I’m pursuing a nursing degree and a full time mom. We just moved into a new home at the end of August. We also have a 4 month old who can be very demanding, especially for me since I exclusively breastfeed.

He just hates his hair being messed with.

He also won't sit in the seat, not if it's off the bike or on the bike. I got him on my lap on the bike, but that's it. Trying to do that every day to get him used to the idea, but he completely refuses to go in the seat.

Love this community haven't posted much but I search everything!

Girl is 3 next week. Daycare since age 1. She's super sweet at home. Any behaviour issues have been manageable by mommy &amp; daddy.

I'm having trouble lately when I find out she is hitting her friend at school. Daughter admits to us and says on her own accord she was hitting her friend, we'll call him Samuel. She says Samuel cried and cried because she hit him. Lots. I asked if teacher had a talk with her after and she says yea.

I feel like I do know when my daughter is fibbing or telling the truth. She says no pretty firm when I ask about something and it's a no. I know how to ask to get some responses and piece together the rest, you all know.

Anyway, I asked one teacher, Sandi, about it, her favorite teacher, she said Samuel went to teacher Sandi crying after he got hit. Sandi said there was no issues yesterday no hitting or crying.

So I don't know who to believe. I usually communicate issues directly to the director of the center. The week before my daughter didn't want to go to school one day. When I queried her she said teacher was calling her naughty and she was really sad saying ""I didn't hit Samuel!"" We stayed home and I told the director she had a bad day. He just had to call and know why I told him ""someone"" called her naughty, maybe another kid? He looked into it and she was jumping on the couch and got talked to.

Anyway, TL:DR-  Mostly what can I do at home to stop her jumping on the furniture and hitting kids at school?

She clams up and doesn't want to reveal much about these incidents. I try to put it delicately without prying or judging of course.

Tantrums, pee all over the floors and blankets multiple times, fighting, not listening. So many tears and little time outs. 
Googling ""is it normal for my 2.5 year old to be rough with the animals"" after he chased the cat with a yoga mat on his arm trying to crush her, and used a wooden truck to play crash to pass with the small dog.
Endless attempts at patience, slowly and softly explaining that animals have feelings, asking after two minutes ""do you know why you got put in a time out"" to make it a learning experience. So many hugs with shrill screams in my ears.
And he loved every minute of it. 😑

And a few days a week he’s the only kid in their extended care program meaning everyone else leaves at 12:15. He’s very good so apparently he just lays on his mat for an hour quietly.

We are using the oh crap method and are now just over a week in. 


She is at the stage now where she will go pee on the potty when prompted, but not unprompted. She has gone poo in the potty a few times when prompted, but mainly accidents still for poop. We can leave the house in pants/commando and she generally holds it fine. 


My concern is, we are still having at least 1 accident per day. And sometimes the accidents are beyond frustrating and seem completely unnecessary. For example, 2 days ago she used the potty to go pee just fine in the morning, and then 10 mins later peed in her pants out of nowhere. And for some reason after she woke up from her nap today, she is on a full-on potty strike. Will sit on the potty but REFUSES to go, and had one giant accident because of it. 


Is this normal for 9 days in? Many people I ask will immediately jump to “are you sure she’s ready?” And that isnt a helpful question because yes I’m pretty sure she’s ready. I put in all this work, I don’t want to throw in the towel already. But I just wonder if I’m doing something wrong so any tweaks or helpful hints would be appreciated.

I feel like I'm ultimately just at an awkward age right now... My daughter ""X"" is 2 3/4 (3 in November) and my son ""Y"" is 1 1/2. They're exactly 15 months and 1 day apart...

My son is at that horrible age where they don't know how to play, and they only grab/take everything from another kid. In general I'd consider my son mischievous and annoying. (Sorry.) Let me start by saying my daughter (my first) was a HORRIBLE baby. Screamed ALL the time, and couldn't sleep without being held. But turned out to be an outstanding toddler. She would always listen to me if I told her not to touch something, she would always follow me in public, I never had to worry about ""corralling"" her or watching where she was. She would always stay by me in public, do whatever was said and still does. 

My son is the opposite. He was a super easy baby, barely cried and would sleep when you put him in the crib within minutes. But he seems to be a troublesome toddler. I have to watch him in public or he'll run away, hates holding hands, if I tell him to stop touching something and even move his hand away from it, he'll put his hand right back and stare at me while doing it.

I have no idea what to do... I just moved to a new city and now I have both kids more often instead of just one or the other. IT'S HORRIBLE. 

Anytime my daughter tries to play with a toy my son is crowding her and grabbing her toys ASAP. I can understand her frustration. At the beginning she was a lot more patient with him, but I've been here a month now and now even if my son ""Y"" is in her presence she is yelling ""GO AWAY!!"" Pushing him, kicking him, telling him to ""go see Daddy"" and throwing him to the floor. Even when he's not doing anything, and just in her general presence. 

I've tried telling my daughter a million times, ""be nice"" ""don't push/kick your brother"" ""stop"" ""it's not nice"" but that seems to be the only subject she won't listen to me in. I don't entirely blame her because I can see how her brother is annoying as shit towards her. (He annoys the crap out of me too.) 

I don't have anybody to learn from... My parents were extremely abusive, and my ex/father of kids has no parents either, and only learns new things when I do myself. So I feel like I'm alone on the learning subject. 

I tried googling how to help but it only mentions ""rewarding good behaviour from the eldest."" But my daughter doesn't really ever show nice playing with him. Ever. It's hard to find the time to teach them to play together because I'm cooking them their meals, keeping the place clean, and taking them out to parks during the day. I don't usually get home to sit down with them unless I'm alone with one of them, one-on-one.

I say lots of positive things with my daughter, ""good job going pee!"" ""Nice waiting at the slide!"" ""Great colouring!"" Everything! She gets lots of praise and attention. They both gets lots of attention...

I really hate being a mom right now and I'm so tired of my son constantly hiding behind me from his sister, and my daughter constantly crying and whining because she can't do anything without him pestering her... (I've tried separating them too, but it just makes my son cry) I wish my kids were older and more in the ""logic"" stage instead of the impulsive toddler stage.

It seemed she was motivated by being around other toddlers using the potty.

For the past 5 months, she mainly been at home with us. We tried using a sticker chart, with some limited success to get her to continue using the potty. She lost interest and we didn't pressure her. She tells us when she's peeing and pooping, but usually while/after it happened. 

About 4 weeks ago, her younger sister was born. 

A few days ago, we attempted 3 day potty training. We kept her pantsless except for outside time (we have mulch and a sandbox!) and it was miserable. She screamed and resisted at nearly every single potty suggestion. She was only willing to sit on the potty while holding an iPad, and we didn't find this sustainable. She pooped and peed on the floor more than in the potty and begged for a diaper repeatedly. She had tantrums all day long that turned quite aggressive. She (unintentionally) kicked me in my csection incision which is still healing. 

On the morning of day 3, we called it quits. She went back into pull-ups. Her attitude completely changed for the better. 

Since then, she's been changing her own pull-ups. Its cool when its just pee. But, she seems to poop after waking up from her nap and silently tries to change her diaper. It's resulted twice in her smearing poop around her room in her attempt to change herself.

We've removed the diapers and wipes from her room. We will be more closely monitoring the end of her nap time. 

What else can we do? How should we move forward with potty training?

- At no to little cost (for instance, I crawl around on all fours with her on my back like I'm a Horsey, we dance a lot, etc)

I read the 3 day potty training book, but bought a little potty for her and she was doing really well on the second day self prompting and only 1 accident. 3rd day I had dad watch her and she pooped on the floor and he freaked out and then she started having accidents all over the place and refusing to go on the potty. Dad thinks she is too young and will take longer to train. I’ve been reading the Oh Crap! Method today and to me it sounds like she is definitely ready, she could hold her pee, go when I asked her to and go without asking or help on the little potty a couple times. She did a little peepee dance so that was her cue. It’s been a week since we’ve put her back in diapers. My question is do you think I should wait until she is 2? It seemed like she was doing so well until she got scared and started refusing. I will admit on the 3rd day we may have been over-prompting.

He started reflux meds and ice cut dairy, which seems to be trending in the right direction, but he’s a baby, so there will still times when he just scream cries. If it happens in the same room with my older son for more than a minute, it upsets my older son to the point where he is hysterically crying and one of us has to sit with him and actively work on helping him calm down. This happened twice in the car driving home from picking the older one up from daycare and again last night at dinner when I had to give the baby medicine.

Has anyone else been through this that has suggestions on anything that was helpful? After the first daycare pick up, I talked through it all with the older one to try to prep him for what might happen in the car, but it didn’t make a difference. It’s to the point where we haven’t been out of the house as a family for over two months because younger son is so hit-or-miss on whether he’ll scream in the car or not.

This is going to be unnecessarily long, because I need to work out my thoughts, so buckle in or bail!

My older son will be 18 months later this month, and he's having a hard time warming up to some family members. I'm not sure if quarantine has anything to do with it, or if personalities are the culprit, maybe a mix, but his anxiety gives Me anxiety, and I just want him to be happy and comfortable.  

Specifically, he is anxious around my in-laws. My mother-in-law in particular, but also my brother-in-law. They have really strong, loud personalities and voices, but we're not a really noisy family at home. We talk, but at like a normal volume, not the volume you'd use of you were talking to someone all the way across a busy sports stadium. As a result, he is more than shy around them. He flat out does not warm up, won't let them hold him without screaming, won't make eye contact, won't let them play with him. Even over many consecutive days.

I don't make him do anything like hug them or even acknowledge their presence, because I remember how much I disliked certain family members after being forced to be affectionate with them as a child. It actually makes me kind of sad because now I've gotten close with one of those family members and I wish we'd always had a closer relationship. That being said, my mother-in-law takes it really personally. After a couple of days of being rejected she gets a bit pouty and I can tell she is really hurt. She doesn't Say anything directly and keeps trying with him, but he's just not having any of it. She is his only grandma so I really want him to have a good relationship with her, and she's such an amazing mom to my husband and his brothers. He's also her first (biological) grandchild so she was so excited for his arrival, and I can tell that her expectations are really letting her down. She was diagnosed with cancer right before we conceived, and is now doing well but I know she worried she may never meet him, and so is all the more invested in it. Man I just feel so bad for her in this regard.

However, I rely on this fantastic woman for support because I have a younger baby as well, and it's becoming difficult to accept help because it is starting to make more work for me calming him down and then still dealing with his needs, on top of dealing with the little baby. I really need the help, but the help is unwanted by my son!

In the before times, he was so chill with them, and spent overnights without us there. I know he's gone through some other developmental changes that may have increased his separation anxiety regardless of covid, but I do worry about the impact our isolation has on him.

My brother-in-law I'm not as worried about because he's just a bit of a bonehead and tries to pick the babies up as soon as he walks through the door, Android 6 I get that a big hairy stranger appearing and plucking you out of your Mama's arms is scary, so we avoid it as much as possible now, but I worry the damage has been done from before I acquired a spine. But we don't see him too often do it's not as big of a deal, but he does love my kids, and my son loves His kids, so I'd like the relationship to improve.

He is not like this with everyone though! For example, my family he's totally cool with. They are significantly quieter, and give him lots of space to come to them, so I'm sure that helps. My dad is one of his best buds, and he lights up when he visits his Grandpa. My sisters are great with him and he adores them, will let them play with him for hours and change him, and I'm really grateful for their presence in my sons' lives. He's also okay with my father-in-law, who is a pretty quiet dude, especially contrasted against his wife, which I think contributes to her totally understandable feelings.

It's hard being his person all of the time when his dad (his Real favourite person) is at work. I want to help him feel safe and comfortable with all these wonderful people who love him and treat him like gold. I want all family members to feel connected to him and not feel rejected constantly. What can I do!!??

Also should note that they are really good people. I don't think that they have ever or would ever do anything to hurt him. I think it's just typical toddler business, I just want to move through it faster. Maybe I should just appreciate it more since it won't last forever, but man it's hard to decline help with the newborn.",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,70633,public,self,Almost 18 month old anxious around family members,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/ircb5u/almost_18_month_old_anxious_around_family_members/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
