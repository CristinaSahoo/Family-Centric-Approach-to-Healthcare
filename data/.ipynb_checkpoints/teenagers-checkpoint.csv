We're less than a decade apart

He is 21

He is in year 2 of a 4 year military contract in another state. 

I wasn't in his life until he was 15 years old (Didn't even know he existed or I would've come in sooner)

Chris has been really unfortunate in that he grew up without his mom - that being said he has had a lot of parental figures (a great aunt, a step mom, and a dad) who have stepped in to raise him at different times. Mostly however, he grew up raised by his father and step mom in a small town in the midwest (and it's a racist and poorly educated one, not the cute ones where everyone knows each other), and his father had ADD - and so does Christopher. His step mom while I don't doubt she loves him very much - is mentally unstable and I'm concerned for him around her. Both of his parents passed away suddenly from underlying conditions and his step mom kicked him out suddenly one day- he has some problems with abandonment so I try to tread very lightly with ultimatums and rule setting. He's lived with me since 16. 

Chris is a very bright, handsome, and healthy young man and I just want him to achieve greatness and happiness. I want to know that he'll have a comfortable life jampacked with joy and a family of his own. THAT BEING SAID, I'm so lost right now. I love this kid like my own and there's never been any question about that- I just don't know how to parent him right now or if I should ? If he were any other 21 year old I'd leave him alone and assume he knows I love him and let him make his mistakes. But I am so terrified of him thinking he's stopped being my kid, especially since he's military and living away from home I know he's going to screw up and get drunk//sleep around. Every time I talk to him - it's the same story, he's sleeping around and getting wasted every weekend and not taking care of himself,  not wearing a mask out with friends, he even stopped wearing sunscreen which I totally thought I had hammered in! 

It's hard for me to talk to him - because every time it scares me. I'm scared for him every day and from 2000 miles away I can't stop him or really do anything. I try to send texts that just say I love you, Goodnight kid, or other short affirmations. I'm trying to find the appropriate balance between guidance and not smothering him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone with a similar kid or experience tell me if these behaviors are normal? If I should be more proactive or if I need to take a step back? Have I messed up? Is this an ADD thing?

I'm doing it all on my own, so financially things does get tight sometimes.
My daughter loves cooking and baking, and wants to become a chef. She already bakes in her spare time and is earning herself a bit of money on the side. She insists on giving me a small percentage of the profit she makes with each sale to cover electricity and using 'my equipment'. This kid is something else, I never asked for this or discussed it with her even, but she insists as she says it's good business.
She was researching and found a second hand kenwood chef that she wants to buy, but it's just expensive and out of reach for her. We discussed it and agreed that I'll buy it for her and it will be her Christmas present and next year's birthday present.
This weekend we drove one town over and went to purchase her kenwood chef. The lady that sold it to us demonstrated how it works and everything was great.
This evening she used her mixer for a biscuit order and the frigging thing burnt out. Electrical smell and everything.
I'm heartbroken for her. 😔
What do I do now? I can't just absorb this cost and still get her a Christmas present and birthday present next year, because I honestly just don't have the money to absorb this cost. Plus if I do, it's a 'double gift' in terms of money spent on her gifts which is unfair to her brother.
But I'm so heartbroken for her... What do I do? Do you think it would be fair to meet her halfway and say I'll still get her a gift for Christmas and her birthday, but she needs to over time pay me back half the cost of this broken mixer.
I feel so cruel doing that though, but also, I can't just absorb the cost and double up on her brother's gifts.

No matter the consequences, no matter who is harmed, regardless of how many times you tell him - the behaviors are repeated.

I sometimes watch two teen girls, 13 and 15 that are a friend's daughters. The friend is in rehab and mostly out of their life. Father got new girlfriend and stepdaughter who he favors, both girls feel rejected by parents. I have a 4 year old and generally just try to be the cool aunt type that listens but I'm not the greatest communicator myself (tough for me to communicate while emotionally charged). 

Today we went to the pumpkin patch, a pre-arranged trip they knew about and expressed interest in. I bought tickets and we went with my husband and daughter.

The entire time they complained about everything. They were hot/tired/bored/feet hurt/hungry, etc. For 4 hours I listened to the complaining every 5 minutes or less, it ruined our entire time. I paid for their lunch, their pumpkins, some sunflowers and drinks as well as pizza without any thank you's, gratitude, pleasantness, or just silence would have been fine. I bought the ""trail frights"" tickets which were $40 bucks for all of us and we didn't do it because the complaining was so terrible I couldn't take it anymore. They didn't want to walk, don't like things jumping out at them, don't like the dark, recognized people there from an old school they wanted to avoid. I dropped $200 bucks for nothing and I'm pissed.

How do I broach this with them? I feel like some of the attitude has to do with their difficult childhood but honestly I don't want to take them anywhere else after today.",True,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,2137.0,public,self,How do you handle whining/complaining,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/j92krl/how_do_you_handle_whiningcomplaining/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We go there every other day but my dad is known to not be the best. He is a very angry person and can be an asshole if he feels like it. I think he vents his frustration from his work on us by punishing us or stuff like that but I can't be sure maybe he's a just a really angry guy. We asked to go to the park today and my dad flipped out and started yelling ""We can't drive you to the park everyday. Go get some exercise and walk to the park. My mom says, ""I can drive them I'm off work."" My dad goes ""No, all they do is sit around playing video games and eating garbage. They can walk today"" I mean that's complete bullshit we both like to go outside and fool around with neighborhood friends or we both like to bike and I, and recently my brother, have picked up skating and we both enjoy it alot. We go to the park as much as we can. We cannot play video games during the week either, and my parents often take us on trips to the mall and grocery store which often take around 4-6 hours. So when the weekend comes, we usually try to get in as much time as possible, in order to get challenges and weekly items. My dad, chooses to focus only on what we do that he doesn't like. He says he's going to get his oil changed and he wants to bring us. We both ask him why he needs us and he says that we need to get away from video games for a couple hours. You give us 2 days out of every week to play video games. How can you not expect us to try and squeeze in as much time as possible when you know we have weekly items we want to get? So anyway we ask our mom and he's flipping out calling us lazy f*ckers. It gets dark at 7 my brother can't get home until 5. If we walk there and back, that gives us about 30 minutes to skate when if we drove we would get 2 hours. My dad needs anger management classes or something because I just want him to stop being such and angry douchebag all the time. Thanks for reading my rant guys. (P.S. I just remembered whenever I talk with my friends on ps4 I close my door and talk slightly above normal talking volume my dad busts In mid conversation and tells me to be quieter. Also he enters my room by banging on the door about 4-5 times super loud. I don't know why he does this.

I would be so grateful for some advice. My niece just turned 18 and has been out of control since she was 13. 

Background:
My niece (18) and her older sister (24) lost their parents when they were 3 and 9 years old. My parents decided to take the girls in and raise them. I(28) left for university abroad and the girls stayed with my parents. The older sister is just fine, she kept good grades and has a decent job now. 

The younger sister however is out of control! At 13, she started misbehaving, from smoking weed and having sex with older guys. My parents couldn’t control her so they enrolled her in an all girls rehabilitation school. She wasn’t allowed out and lived there for several months. When she came out, she seemed fine at first but after 1 month, she started sneaking out the house again, getting high and having  sex with wayyyy older men. My mom passed and after her behavior continued, my dad enrolled her in long term for 3 years - she was only released on 28 Sept and already 1 Oct, she was caught with an older guy in her bedroom smoking weeding and having sex. My dad is terrified of having strange men in and out the house - men she doesn’t even know since she’s been locked away for the past 3 years!!
My father will be 70 soon and I live abroad. I know this stress is too much for him and it’s difficult for her to come live with me since I live in Dubai for work and that type of behavior would def land her in jail!

My dad just wants her out now! I’m so worried about her future and what will happen to her on the streets. She doesn’t have relationships with other family members, she’ll be all alone- the guilt is killing me because I feel responsible for seeing her be successful but she doesn’t seem to care much. When I speak to her, she says she does care and wants to do better but always seems to mess up. Please, what should we do?! She has therapists who said she was ready for the “real world” and noted significant improvements! They are shocked to find out she is doing these things after being away for 3 years!! I feel helpless, she lives in the Caribbean so it’s hard to imagine what her life will be like, I’m scared of unwanted pregnancies, diseases or worst - rape or death.

edit : about an hour ago my mom made me take the password off of my phone and leave it on the counter downstairs - i didnt want to but she said ""i won't do anything!"" defensively when i told her i didnt want her to look through my phone - while i went up to my room to do hw on my laptop. i just want back downstairs real quick for a snack and found out that my mom had been looking through my phone at everything. i put my password back on it; i'll probably get in trouble for it later but im just upset and pissed rn.",True,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,2108.0,public,self,privacy for teenagers (15 y/o),0.0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/j28ao6/privacy_for_teenagers_15_yo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eldest is 14 and has had issues with anxiety since they were 8 (probably before but they became obvious around this age) 

We've been through (not thorough) assessment for dyspraxia and autism and it was concluded it was anxiety disorder that was causing the issues. 

In the past year or so they've been having more and more difficulty in falling asleep and staying asleep for a full night. First we put it down to hormones but it's getting worse. Typical teen would normally be a struggle to get up in the morning! 

We've been trying warm showers, comfier bedding, pillow sprays (lavender/chamomile) and chill out before bed but nothing is working. 

Not sure if this is also connected but we had an incident last night of bed wetting for the first time since they were a toddler. 

Lots of issues with over thinking and negative mindset which have been difficult to change even with regular psychology appts and CBT. 

Recently melatonin was suggested but I wondered about CBD oil instead as it's said to help with anxiety as well.

Son got in an accident last week (his fault) and we think the magnitude of the situation had hit him. 

We went to school this morning and texted us that he’s leaving school and he’s feeling stressed and anxious

Husband replied no you are not (meaning you aren’t leaving school) but son took it like he’s not stressed. Son is saying we don’t care about his mental health and he will not be coming home at all this weekend. 

We pay for his phone and I can track him in it but he’s turned off his location services and I don’t know where he is. We assume he is at his girlfriends but we aren’t sure. 

We are loving parents and are trying our best. He thinks we are controlling. I feel like we failed him, he’s selfish, no worth ethic (he does have a job) with no real direction. We are able to give our children things we didn’t have growing up but most of all we try to give them our time. 17 year old son wants nothing to do with us for the most part. We have a 19 year old and a 13 year old and they are not like him. 

Not sure what to do. Thought we would let him have tonight and then demand him to come home by noon tomorrow or there are consequences. What if he won’t come home?  What can we do?

He won’t respond to texts and we are telling him we love him and want to talk to him and work this out 

Looking for some non judgemental advice please. I’m a wreck.

For context I am in my early twenties and I recently moved back home after finishing college. I have to share my little brother's room. It was going well during the holidays but now that school has started again every day gets worse. On top of being diagnosed with asperger, he is now a teenager.

He is extremely stubborn. He eats everything he comes across, leaving nothing for the rest of us, lies, is completely obssessed with money and 100% self-centered. Asking him to do something is hard because he doesn't remember things that don't interest him, so you have to ask 20 times. He's always been that way but now on top of that he's became quite rebellious and talks back every chance he gets. He has some qualities to him and can be very cool but as soon as things don't go his way he can be the worst. He likes pushing people's buttons for fun and doesn't have much empathy. To sum it up : he is exhausting.

I'm home all day so I have to deal with him quite often and honestly I don't know how to handle the amount of ungratefulness and impertinence he shows on a daily basis. When we argue I try to remain calm as getting angry doesn't really work with him anyway, but I'm often on the verge of tears because I am so disappointed and angry by how careless and cold he can be. He is money/reward motivated and that is it. I'm angry because I don't think he realizes how hurtful and tiring his behaviour is and how it affects our family. I know it's bad but deep down I think I want to hurt him like he hurts us, because he simply is incapable of understanding it and does not care one bit.

I just want to keep my cool and try to keep a good relationship with him (my big sister now hates him and doesn't really talk to him anymore), but it is so hard. I try to think before I speak and I leave the room when angry but I hate feeling this way. I'm usually a very calm person but everyone has a limit.

We are carrying out a study exploring how awareness of our bodies is related to the quality of relationships we form and our mental health. To investigate this, we are asking people ages 11-18 and their parent/guardian to help us with our research. This study has been reviewed and approved by the College Ethics Committee at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Participation involves parents and their child completing a set of online questionnaires. The study takes approximately 15 minutes for parents and 25 minutes for your child. Participants welcome from anywhere in the world.

“Whether or not a parent monitors a child’s Social Security number can lead to someone using that information to commit fraud,” said Aliza Vigderman of Security.org. “The crime can go undetected for years, as most victims don’t discover it until they are adults trying to apply for a loan or file a tax return, and by that point it’s too late, except for the thief!” 

Security.org’s ([https://www.security.org](https://www.security.org/)) new report, **“Child Identity Theft: Parent Awareness, Behaviors and Attitudes,”** finds more than one-third of parents don’t follow best practices such as shredding documents or storing online records securely. 

It can be found at:  

[**https://www.security.org/digital-safety/child-identity-theft/**](https://www.security.org/digital-safety/child-identity-theft/) 

In addition, the study found that:  

* Nearly two-thirds of parents are concerned about child identity theft, with the most frequently cited risks being social media, medical records and school forms. 
* Fifteen percent of parents haven’t taken any action to prevent child identity theft, such as shredding - or safely storing - sensitive documents, reviewing a child’s education records or limiting information posted on social media. 
* Forty-three percent of parents with household income brackets $175,000 and up reported child identity theft, higher than the average reported child identity theft of 23 percent from households with incomes of $174,999 and below.

She was diagnosed at 6 or 7 originally. At that age I took her to therapy for 9 or 10 months but she refused to participate. At 8 she broke my nose, on a seperate occassion hot me in the face with her booster seat nearly causing a car accident. She was placed in acute inpatient psychiatric care on her 9th birthday and again at 12 when she attacked me and threatened to kill my cat. She refuses her medication, refuses to leave the house, refuses therapy and is showing signs of disassociating. She is in a mental health crisis, about a month ago a friend and I were able to take her to the ER (was a minor miracle that we got her in the car and didn't have to call 911) but they refused to treat her because she says she doesn't want to hurt herself or anyone else (because she knows what not to say). Have had to confiscate a steak knife from her room and kitchen shears, scissors and a utility knife from under her pillows. At 14 she is too large for me to physically restrain her on my own let alone transport her to city seling etc if she is refusing. 

I used to hold out hope that she would outgrow her issues or that someday we could have a relationship resembling that of family members or parent/child but at this point it is not likely. She has confided she doesn't feel e.otions like other people, doesn't feel empathy and doesn't experience guilt especially when she feels justified in her anger which doesn't take much (the other day she lost it because I didn't tear a croissant in half to eat it and that wasn't the 'right' way to eat it). 

At 9 her counselor recommended a place like Provo Canyon School...I refused after looking them up and seeing their history of violations and abuse allegations not only by staff but also other children placed there. She was much higher functioning at that time as well.

Now I am looking at long term residential treatment but most programs are easily $10,000+ a month and am still fighting insurance to cover her bills from 2 years ago.

Her father has tbi and ptsd, a history of domestic violence and substance abuse and they do not have a relationship. 

At this point I am not sure what else to do. I just know we can't keep living this way for either of our sakes. I worry about inpatient placement as those facilities are prone to abuse. I also worry about fister care and if she is sent to be with her father...

First of all, I’d like to commend you all for the nightmare you’re currently enduring/hopefully somewhat enjoying. I certainly do not envy you.

OK, ladies and gents, I am aware that this is an awkward conversation to have with your reclusive, moody teens but by god, you must have it.

Also, admittedly, this is not an anecdote I’m particularly thrilled to share, but for the sake of your children I ought to divulge it. Please be kind.

Recently, in the process of losing my virginity, I became confused as to what my partner was expecting in terms of retraction of the foreskin. I experienced a great deal of discomfort during a large portion of the process. Ultimately, what could have been a lovely experience was one that I left quite confused and totally embarrassed.

“How so?”, you may ask. Well, not only was I not taught proper genital hygiene by my parents (nor my rather prestigious school, which is rather concerning), I was at no point informed that the foreskin is supposed to be retracted to behind the glans. Yes, I should think that it sounds silly, because it is. In my 15 years of living, no one had bothered to explain to me how such an important part of me works and how to look after it. So after doing some research, it appears that, due to my appalling lack of education, I have contracted a mild case of balantits. A completely avoidable condition in this situation had I merely been educated.

So, you wonderfully brave people, I implore you that you take the time to sit your lad down and have a chat, just short, sweet and without any faffing about and he should get the point, or at least be informed enough to pursue further education online (of which there is plenty, to a higher standard, [I endorse this comprehensive article from the well-renowned University of Queensland should you yourself need a refresher] (https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2019/12/‘how-do-i-clean-my-penis’) ).

They don’t want to come over, though, unless 17DD is home.) 

My world has revolved around 17DD for 17 years (in a healthy way, of course.) Every decision I made was scrutinized thoroughly (by me) because I knew it would affect her life. I was 18 when I married her dad, 20 when I gave birth to her. Being 20 years apart in age has actually been great. I was always her parent first, but the older she got, the closer we became and she’s confide in me and depend on me like a friend. 

I live in Louisiana. Her dad lives in Georgia. He’s an airline pilot, so DD flies for free. She’s been able to fly to go visit him whenever his/her schedules allowed, and I never stopped her from visiting. 

Her dad gave her a BMW for her 17th birthday, with the stipulation that she stay the summer with him to watch his 3 boys (from his 2nd wife) in order to work off the car. Definitely a fair trade. She didn’t want to go. Thought she’d be bored. She didn’t want to go most of the summer without being with me. She knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime, so went anyway. 

Summer progresses. Since her stepmom isn’t there anymore, she’s more comfortable and feels more at home there. She finally develops a better relationship with her dad. She gets to spend time with her little brothers. She finds a job babysitting for some spending cash. She ends up with a boyfriend. Her dad finally goes “FB official” with a chick he’s been seeing, and honestly, she’s great and I’m happy for him. They all go on mini vacays to Las Vegas, San Francisco, wherever, especially when he has a long layover somewhere cool. DD is happy. 

Over the summer, I get vibes from her that she’s considering staying in GA. She eventually tells me she wants to split her time half and half between us. Then it ends up being that she wants to live there and visit me when she can. The day before yesterday made it official. She registered for school in GA. 

My heart shattered. 

Logically, I get it. She has a chance to have relationships with her dad and brothers that she couldn’t before. He can give her a lifestyle I never could afford. She loves the area they live in better than where I live. She can be a “jet setter” and do spontaneous vacays and such, and drive around ATL in her BMW with her cute BF. She’s 17, and her priorities are different than before. It happens as you grow up and stretch out your wings. 

My heart, though... I am devastated. I knew she’d move on in life, because that’s how life goes. I just figured I’d have that one last year, her senior year, with her. Her last year of dance (which I’ve been driving her to and from for the past 6 years) where she’d be able to do the special senior dancer presentation and performance. Prom. Her school here doesn’t do junior prom, so I’ve been looking forward to her senior prom. Waiting for acceptance letters to colleges in the mail. 

Just. Being. Her. Mom.

For one last year...

Who am I now? What do I do with myself? I can’t crawl out of this depression and grief long enough to do any of the things I usually enjoy. I know I’ll “always be her mom”, but it’s not the same. I’m lost now. And after the news of her registering for school there, I feel like I’ve been emotionally kicked in the gut.

Since she has moved in with us we have had her sneak out of the house twice at age 12 to go to a 16 year old boys house, I've caught her trying to steal my blood pressure medication &amp; I know she's gone through our bedroom &amp; stolen things, had the school call more times i can count with her in the counselors or nurses office saying that she's crying because of some injustice in her life, sending inappropriate photos on my work phone even though she swore she wouldn't, etc. I realize that kids go through things like this but these are not my main concern. 
My main concern is her need for attention &amp; how she will lie or exaggerate stories to get that attention. Since she's started puberty the attention seeking behavior has gotten worse. It's gotten to the point that she will not speak to us unless she wants something &amp; if we say no she will become abusive (cussing, throwing a fit, exaggerating stories about whichever parent has ""wronged"" her to anyone who will listen).
Over the past few days, I got her a new phone for her 15th birthday because she seemed to be doing better with her bad behavior. Within that week and a half she has completely flipped. She then went to a friend's house for a week.  She then asked if this friend could come over on 2 days her father &amp; I were working and I said no but she could come over the weekend she started cursing me out, calling the idea of her coming over the weekend pathetic, complaining how she never gets to do anything, how she's ""so fucking pissed"" that she wanted to punch someone It went on and on and turns out they never asked if the girl could come over &amp; she wasn't allowed anyway!
I ended up going off on her after she cussed at me while she was still at the friend's house over the phone &amp; it was more of the same of how terrible her life is &amp; how terrible her father &amp; i are. 
Then she texts me the next day to ask if I'll drive her to some random boys house. When I bring up her behavior of cursing someone out &amp; then asking them to do something, especially if she doesn't speak to us unless she's asking for something she said ""how am I supposed to talk to you unless I'm asking something?"" This blew me away. I really don't think she values anyone unless they are doing something for her &amp; it's really causing me to worry about her future. Can someone tell me, is this behavior normal?

Another short example of her behavior - last year I scheduled a 7 day cruise &amp; we were to board the boat on her birthday. She actually got pissed off because we would be boarding a boat on her birthday &amp; there wouldn't be anything special ON her birthday. If it doesn't happen the day of her birthday then nothing you do matters &amp; she feels sorry for herself. Keep in mind, she never acknowledges anyone else's birthday unless you remind her &amp; then it's a quick Happy birthday.",True,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,1967.0,public,self,Concerned about my stepdaughter,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/ieat3i/concerned_about_my_stepdaughter/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My eldest daughter is 19. She has problems with alcohol and weed. She hates herself. Her dad was emotionally abusive to me throughout her growing up, and to her. He is a narcissist and used my eldest as the 'scapegoat' whilst my then youngest was the 'golden child'. We later went on to have another child when our then youngest was 11, our now youngest, is now 5. 
Because I was in an abusive relationship, was controlled and manipulated, I sided with him on so many things I shouldn't have. I stepped back and watched as bad parenting would happen. My self esteem was so low and my life at the time went from extreme highs to extreme lows and I struggled when obstacles came up as I was running on so little energy, physical and emotional. 
We have been separated since June 2018. We are now divorced. I still struggle with breaking free from the way my ex made me feel, we were together for 18 years. I educated myself about narcissist behaviours not long before the split. 
My mum died in November 2018, aged 64, and my eldest had the best relationship with her, seeing as I wasnt 'available' throughout my marriage. 

I have a lot of guilt. 

In December 2019 I had a sudden cardiac arrest. The results have now shown it was genetic. 
So not only have my 3 children had their parents split up (albeit messy, it was definitely the right decision I made), their very close grandparent died (my 16 year old daughter, the middle daughter, found her), and then their mother got rushed to hospital in an ambulance having had 3 sets of defribillator shocks, whilst they are all downstairs waiting. My boyfriend was with me when it happened, thank God... he performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, my only sibling, my brother came immediately to care for the 3 girls and I can't thank them enough. They stopped what happened being something they had to deal with directly. In fact if my boyfriend hadnt have been there, they would have walked into my dead body that early Thursday morning. 

So we are dealing with a lot. I've been in recovery, I'm almost back to normal, my brain needs more work as I was out for 15 minutes. We have, as a family been trying our best to just get though the day to day stuff. My eldest finished her 3rd year at college in the pandemic. My middle daughter didnt sit gcses, and is awaiting results this week (predicted grades). My youngest is going into year 1. 

So my 19 year old has been on a path of self destruction since my mum passed. I wasnt really parenting for a while after my mum passed. I let things go. I didnt want stress. I didnt want to stress   they'd been through enough, and so had I. It didnt work out. My ex was causing problems for me left right and centre. I was doing a shit job of being a parent and was finally reigning it all back in when I had the cardiac arrest. But my eldest two seemed to resent me after the CA.  I really needed their help when I got back from hospital and they moaned and I just couldn't do everything that needed to be done. By the middle of January 2020 I'd decided enough was enough. I sent me eldest to her dads (he sent her to his eldest daughters after 2 days) and my middle daughter almost assaulted me and went to her half sisters house a couple of days later. My middle daughter stayed with her half sister until mid April,  she wanted to come back and make amends but I was reluctant and scared but I allowed her. 
Then two weeks ago my eldest also wanted to come back. I was very reluctant for this to happen. My eldest also has manipulating tendencies, like her dad, and I was very happy as it were. And now the alcohol is a problem and the weed is a problem and I feel the stress coming back, not only for me but for my younger two and I'm not sure what to do. I want to help her, but she doesnt want to help herself. Her child benefit ends at the end of August and I've told her she needs to give me 25% of a wage she hasn't got yet. She has an interview in a couple of days. She has been super helpful around the house, but things just arent right. She takes fluoxetine and I've urged her to get counselling. She is so resistant to do anything to help herself. When she does have a job (and she's had many!) She just decides she cant be bothered anymore. She has older men off the internet sending her money for I dont know what! It's a mess! Does anyone know what I should do? My brother and boyfriend were so resistant to letting my eldest (and my middle daughter really too) come back after they witnessed her treating me badly. But I'm their mother. I feel like it's my responsibility. 
Oh dad really doesnt have much to do with the eldest two. They ask him for money a lot (without my knowledge) but he has a girlfriend he lives with 3 hours away so isn't around to share the parenting responsibilities.

As a family we are big on emotion coaching and one to one chats about issues that come up, but this isn't quite doing it for her anymore. I know that my parenting style needs to adapt as she gets older but I'd like to consciously parent her through it rather than just respond to the flow. I have my own experience as a teenage girl to look back on I guess, but my mum wasn't there for me in the way I'd like to be there for my daughter, so some tips would be useful.

We have a large team of outpatient therapists involved, including individual therapy, medication management, family therapy, individual addiction therapy, and addiction group therapy. Unfortunately, things are continuing to escalate despite every intervention we’ve tried (and they’ve been extensive and not just limited to therapy). Her drug use and the combination of substances she has or continues to use put her at risk of accidental overdose. Furthermore, she has stolen money and drugs from family and friends, and alcohol from stores, putting her at risk of serious legal consequences. She continues to use drugs in our house, even after we confiscate and destroy everything regularly, which we are adamantly opposed to. We are working with the mental health and addiction team and our insurance regarding a temporary higher level of care, like an inpatient facility to try to better manage underlying mental health concerns and help her learn better coping skills to try to be clean an sober. Those are usually only about a month long. Our daughter does not think she has a problem and doesn’t want help, she blames us for all her issues and behavior. The only reason she does the therapy is because we make her.

Any parents been through this before? We understand addiction is complicated and likelihood of relapse, even after treatment, is pretty high. We’re concerned it might be worse for our daughter since she still doesn’t take accountability or want to change.

One of our main concerns is people keep talking to us like we have many options, but we don’t see what they are outside of the temporary solutions (like short term inpatient) that our insurance will pay for? And even then, we can’t physically force her to go in the building if she says no, and neither can the staff, because that would be abuse.

We can’t kick her out of the house if she continues on this path, since she’s our legal responsibility and that would be considered abuse/neglect in the form of abandonment. 

We kind of feel like she runs the show now, because if she decides not to change, there is nothing we can do aside from making her do therapy, taking away privileges, and filing police report(s) if she continues to commit illegal acts. We can say “you’re not allowed to live here if you keep doing these things, so you can choose to get help and stop, or you have to move out,” but that’s not true, because we have no where we could send her.

We don’t have enough money to afford “boot camp” or “rehab” or “boarding school” out of pocket, if this fails. 

Are we missing something? 

While we’re afraid our daughter could end up dead or in jail, and that’s the primary concern, we are also admittedly struggling with how this is impacting our life. We’re at the point now that we have security cameras everywhere, locks on doors in the house so she can’t get our valuables, when people come over we have to lock up their stuff so she doesn’t steal it, and we can’t really bring her anywhere because she might steal from other people. We have to regularly search her things to destroy the drugs and paraphernalia. We can’t trust her at all. We have to supervise her most of the time and she can’t really have any freedom away. And of course having to live in a house where drugs are being used. It’s really a poor quality of life.",True,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,1941.0,public,self,Parenting teenager with mental health and addiction issues,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/i9rp8b/parenting_teenager_with_mental_health_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Context: I'm 17 and a boy, and my mom rarely ever has anything good to say to me. Granted I'm not the best at academics( ~70-90%) but she rarely says anything besides talk about how worried she is for my scores or what colleges I plan to or should apply to. And she never likes to take help or advice from anyone unless she asks for it. 
We are looking after 4 newborn kittens currently and me and my dad had to go out on an emergency to get a replacement formula and syringe to feed them. Today, when I tried to tell her that the way she was feeding them wasn't the safest, she weny ballistic on me. She started telling me that she didn't get to live a ""luxurious"" childhood like I am(we're upper middle class) and that she never gave two shits whether a cat fed her kittens or let them die or anything and says I shouldn't either. Wtf? They deserve to live as much as we do and they're my cat's babies. Then she goes off on how she wishes she could have sent me away to boarding with nothing so I could learn how to live like she did and how in her view she has been nothing but a ""slave"" to my dad and now me (she tells me to only focus on academics, so I do that but she tells me to focus on everything else and that I should be living independently like my cousin, who barely passed grade 10, still failing in a subject and wants to run a photocopying store) and she gets angry all the time at both of us because we're incapable of ""lateral thinking"". 
On top of this, I never have the heart to argue with her because she always has to be right no matter what and she tries to enforce her views on me in the name of teaching me to accept knowledge. 
She even comments a lot on my FRIENDS' looks and behaviour which I have told her not to(countless times but she doesn't listen) and always thinks my best friend, who is a girl is some kind of sneaky shit trying to destroy my life. She tries to tell me that I should never let my emotions get in the way of anything. I literally don't know how to deal with her and I've just been obeyingnand agreeing with her on everything for the past 7 years.

Any advice? Does she need to see someone? She did it at around 3pm I think, ear isn't sore, not weeping or discoloured, she has no temperature, it isn't seeping, nor did it bleed.

I know this is probably strikingly obvious but mum and dad think she'll be fine and I'm just overreacting. I, however, feel as though she needs to be seen.

But lately he's decided that I- his Mom- am a particularly good target, and he's getting disrespectful. Every single day, whatever I do or say is stupid or pointless. He corrects the way I say things, thought it was dumb of me to take out a credit card instead of cash at the sandwich shop (I was buying HIM a sandwich and pop), and he makes fun of my lack of short-term memory and forgetting things. He and I are both home for the summer, my husband and older sisters work full time, and he's often bored. I think he's decided that teasing ME has become a way to entertain himself! 

I don't mind good natured ribbing. My personality has always been to joke back and be good natured and let it slide. But he's my son. And I'm his mom. 

I already raised 2 girls, they're 22 and 20. The now 20 year old went through a really disrespectful and mean-to-me stage when she was in her teens. She's much more kind and mature now. The only difference with her was that it was direct, meant to take her frustrations out on me, and it wasn't disguised as jokes and humor. 

Should I start taking away privileges like his IPad if he continues this?

Being not his actual parents, were obviously in a difficult place. I want to take his phone away until school starts and ground him until the time being, because he broke our rules, our one major rule involving his phone.

 However I try to put myself in his shoes. I wasnt getting naked pictures of anyone but when i was 13 I was interested in porn and was a typical boy. Parents, can you help me out here please?

I am a single mom and she asked me if her boy friend sleep over and I said I am not comfortable with that so I said no. 

However, She brought her boy friend any way and slept and spent time in her room last night.

(All have birthdays soon)
 
Currently the two oldest, my husband and I live in a travel trailer with the youngest living 50 ft away with my husband’s parents. The 11 year old is free to flit back and forth at will, while the other two really don’t spend much time with the grandparents due to conflict caused by grandma. 

This situation was originally put in place due to finances, and some severe mental health concerns on my end. Since then my husband has graduated college , and finally landed a well paying job that is going to allow us to move into an actual home/apartment with all 3 kids. My mental health has stabilized and I’m working as well. (For background)

When we move, we will not be charging the oldest rent, utilities, phone, insurance etc, even though she has a part time job. We were talking earlier about the financial aspect of moving, insurance and child care for her siblings. She brought up the topic, not me. She had surgery in January and needs a second surgery to finish repairing a hole in her bladder. My husband’s recent job change meant the loss of our health insurance so we will be getting that ourselves. We didn’t realize how expensive it would be, between $1500 and $2000 a month for the family. Her college plans have been disrupted by the needed surgery, Miss Rona (as she calls it) and out of district costs of college. She just graduated from high school and with an Associate’s Degree from the local community college. 

Though the middle and youngest are both old enough to not need a sitter, they absolutely do not get along and can’t be left alone together. Because of the way they don’t get along, I am unwilling to hire an outside sitter. The middle child has some mental health challenges of his own and can be difficult. (He’s not a danger, just an asshole) 

Before we got the estimate on how much insurance cost, our plan was for me to become a housewife again to take care of the kids after school because my husband doesn’t have set hours. 

Now to the point. The oldest volunteered to watch them for approximately 3 1/2 hours Mon - Fri from the time they get home from school until I get home. I’m not entirely sure that is fair to her. They aren’t her responsibility. If she were to watch them, it would be pretty much just making sure they leave each other alone and not arguing. I’m fairly certain that after grabbing a snack, my son will retreat to his room to be left alone. 

Is this too much to ask of my oldest? She will be 18 by the time we move. Her employer is more than willing to work with her schedule to allow this, so it would not have an impact on her job. Is this something that we should pay her for, considering we will 100% be taking care of her financially?",True,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,1865.0,public,self,Almost 18 year old and responsibilities,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/hyy7qh/almost_18_year_old_and_responsibilities/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He plays video games, all day and night, like I am talking from the time he wakes up at **12 pm to 6 am (!)** and let me tell you my sister does not really have a very good foundation herself. She eats junk food every single day, like I'm talking fast food pizza, Mcdonald's every single day, and my nephew imitates just that. She also is a very moody person, she yells at me every single time I say something. The way she talks is just like she as some sort of attitude towards me as well.

Like fuck, I am only 25 but I know how to treat people, and know how I want to be treated especially with my family. She is very unapproachable, and I am EONS closer to my friends than I am with her. I am a super laid back person and love to talk to people, but with my sister, it's a different story and I don't talk to her for that very reason.

My nephew hasn't ate a single vegetable since he was born, not even like a leaf, just straight pizza, soda and Mcdonald's. Everytime I try to get him to try vegetables he starts to cry, and get frustrated and my sister starts to yell at me. He doesn't get good grades at all in school, and he's that type of person that doesn't know how to tie his shoe, so his mom gets him slip on shoes instead of teaching him. He gets super frustrated with a lot of things, and even though he is 12 years old I see this as a issue that he does not have a father figure in his life ( I did not either).

My mom (his grandma) does not see any issue with anything and still babies him on everything as well. He refuses to go outside to socialize with his friends or doesn't like to play outside, just stay home all day and play video games, like he was playing until 6 am and I took away his laptop (that I gifted him for Christmas) and then at night now he just plays on his iPhone using data (I have no jurisdiction to take that away.) I try to get him to come do things with me like walk my dog or workout but he refuses and I don't want to force him to. I used to take him to the library or fishing all the time but now he only wants to play video games.

During the day I have a lot of things that I do, like work, music production, spending time with friends. I know part of the issue is that he does not have a father figure, and I always keep blaming myself for it that I'm not a good enough uncle, and never find time to spend with him. It really sucks, but I really do not want to take part in being the father figure at this point in my life especially when his mom treats me like absolute dog shit, and I know it's for him not her but still...

*Sidestory:* *I was in the same exact situation as him without a father figure. I was the most bullied victim, all four years of highschool, had a 0.9 GPA. Literally ditched school every single day to try to avoid being bullied and racked up 300 unexcused absences by Sophomore year of HS. Just to go home and play video games from sun up to sun down. Tried every prescription anti depressants on the market until they told me it was time for EST (Electro shock therapy where they shock your brain for depression treatment, of course I declined.)*

*I was expelled from highschool for drug dealing, and dropped out community college with all D’s and F’s in my class. My depression and anxiety continued. Joined the military (US Army) for six years because I had no direction. I realized that I needed to build my character through hard experiences. That was going to be the only way to fight my depression and anxiety. Went to State University after, and struggled a bit while working full time at a Biopharma company. Today my depression and anxiety is almost completely gone, drug free.*

I know all of you have this thing where it seems better to just leave a certain issue alone, or separate yourself from that situation to avoid conflict and have a peace of mind. But at times throughout the day I do blame myself entirely, for him just wasting his childhood life in his room. I was in the same exact situation. What can I do to help his absolute garbage eating habits, his insane video game usage (because I can't control it), overall shape him to become a better person? Or should I just allow my sister/mom to pamper him with no real direction for him in life?

My mom died three years ago. My husband and I took in my younger siblings (9 and 13 at the time). Everything still feels so new to us. 

Now, we’re dealing with mental health issues for one sibling (he’s 15 now). We know he’s got issues related to grief but he’s also showing OCD symptoms (mostly constant hand washing right now). We’re working with a facility, he ha taking prescription medication... we’re just trying everything we can. 
I know It’s hard for him. And I feel bad anytime I start to feel frustrated. 
I have my own mental health issues to work on that date back before mom passed, and has just gotten worse. But I’m trying my best to be present for the kids. 
Well, today was just a bad day. It was a bad day at work, he had a bad day at home. When I got home, his hands were red and raw from washing so much. Also, I hadn’t noticed because I work so much that ALL the towels I had washed on Wednesday were now gone. I still have no idea what he does with the towels when my husband and I are at work, but he’ll use a whole cabinet full in one week. It was just... not a good day. 

I went off on him. I never lost control like this before. But today was just the last straw. All this time we’re putting into this and all the times he says he understands what he’s doing and how it’s affecting him yet he’s still doing it. And I feel like a failure of a “parents because I have to go to work everyday and I cannot be home to help him work through it. And I just lost my shit tonight. I feel horrible.

I want this 13F to be strong, confident, and to be able to explore her sexuality on her own terms. But how do I encourage her to do this without posting photos that reveal too much online? 

Important notes: 

1. Not my biological child, she is my cousins child. Her parents are in jail. She lives with her grandma (my aunt) and I take care of her when she is not with grandma. This child jokingly will call me “mom” every once in a while. I’ve always considered her to be like a younger sister to me. 

2. She experienced regular sexual trauma when she was a child. The incidents stopped January 2019. She is supposed to begin therapy in late April (getting her just an appointment has been a long and complicated process that I’m sure has compounded all the trauma she hasn’t been dealing with); but with this Coronavirus sweeping the U.S I worry that her starting therapy is going to be pushed back even further.


Another thing: I personally think that replacing her iPhone with a camera-less trac phone would solve the problem of her posting these photos on the internet, but I worry that it would just be as effective as putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound in the long run. 

Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation to this?

This morning, right as I was waking up, my Dear Daughter (12f) hit me with the info that her bff(12) had texted and told her that he has decided that he is female to male trans and his preferred pronouns. DD said ok and that was pretty much the end of the exchange. To be clear, she is not particularly bothered by this revelation, is a pretty ""go along, get along"" kind of person, and didn't ask any follow up questions. I personally don't particularly care about this transition because not my child, not my body, not my problem. These two have not seen each other in person since March when schools shut down but have kept in contact.  Previously, DD often spent the night with her friend, so of course the question of if sleepovers will resume after quarantine came up in her conversation with me. I started to say no since we normally wouldn't let her spend the night with boys but then stopped myself because this relationship existed prior to the transition and I need to think on it a little bit. DD's dad will be of the opinion that, if he's a boy now then he will be treated as a boy and that means no more spending the night. I'm not sure if this is the appropriate response to the situation.

So he has done a complete 180 and its really hard, my mom has had to file for incompetency which has been hell because my dad doesn't see what's wrong with himself and so he thinks my mom is after his money. She's not, but we needed to because he was trying to send money to girls on Facebook because he was ""saving the from the sex trade"" (they are sugar babys looking for money and he doesn't see that). So yeah he sometimes treats me like dirt for defending my mom and stuff, I've always been a head strong, stubborn mouthy little snot and ok so back to the issue at hand. My boyfriend and I have been in a serious relationship for 2 years and we've been off and on ""dating"" since we were like 12 and 15 (yes yes the age gap, trust me my parents had an issue with it too). Now I grew up with him, his mom babysat me and my brother when we were younger and his sister is my best friend, we hid our relationship when we kids because well we knew they'd break us up, and that came true when I was 14 my dad read my texts with him and I had said something about wanting to make out with my boyfriend in his bed (listen I was young and stupid). And so my dad cut us off, it was by far the worst couple of months in my life. But then again about 10 months later he and I started secretly talking again, I was 15 and he had turned 18, we kept it secret and I ended up losing my virginity. Now please dont hate my boyfriend he is honestly one of the most hard working and down to earth guys you could meet, he is amazing and there was absolutely no pressure to have sex, honestly it happened accidentally. But anyway so that happened, and now fast forward to this past week, so my parents are Christian and I'm trying my best to be a good and not sinful kid but well its been tough😂. And so my dad decided to snoop thru my messages using the family computer, I didn't realize I was logged in but I was and I tried to cover my tracks but sometimes I forgot to delete some things and so my dad just as thrilled as ever in his demented state decided to discuss it over the dinner table with my little brother (15) present. I felt betrayed and hurt because I had finally felt safe like nobody could take me away from my boyfriend again, and I want to be honest with my mom and tell her my virginity is long gone and everything but she has made it clear that if she knew the whole truth and if we did have sex it would be game over. So now I've had the biggest teenage attitude you could find towards my dad and sometimes my mom. I feel bad I do, but I wanna just be honest without risking my relationship.

I feel like it  belongs because its a teenager. I dont like talking about this, but I am curious what others would do in our situation because we question ourselves constantly. 

We just had a baby, ready to take on life and i get a call from my father who I havent talked to in almost 2 years telling me my brother has been to different behavior hospitals from PA(where they lived) to Dallas, TX and if nobody picked him up he would end up in foster care.

Naturally we took him in because i don't want my brother in foster care. My dad kept insisting that it was temporary and that he had another hospital lined up in San Antonio in December. After a very long discussion my wife and i agreed he didnt need that, he needed a caring, loving, and the right disciplinary system in place. 

My family was very against because my brother has been known to be ""the bad kid"" when he was younger. But he proved to be well be haved for the most part. In a short time period we got him saying manners and being respectful, got him on a steady bed time and not staying up pulling all nights playing video games, not eating junk food constantly and eating whenever, and hasn't said one curse word since hes been with us(his dad let him cuss left and right whenever he wanted to)and my family actually enjoyed him and took him as one of us. 

When January came, I had to enroll him into school, something I thought I wouldn't be doing for several years, especially for a kid that wasn't mine. Things became tough, ya know because he was the new kid. He started stealing, looking at porn, acting out at school and it was like he was a new person. 

We had a pretty good talk and I told him pretty much everything, that we were his last choice and if he acted up he was going back to his dads, who straight up said ""i don't know what i would do with him"" and that we wanted him to have a happy healthy home. But if he kept things up he wouldn't have a home because we need him to help because having a baby is tough already. 

Its tough, never in a million years would my wife and i think we would be taking care of my brother. We really aren't ready for a teenager but were taking it a day at a time. My dad is very stingy about money, we struggle so much to have enough groceries. He gets social security from his mom who died when he was younger, but it all goes to my dad. My wife is a stay at home mom and is constantly stressed because were trying to be more responsible and limit screen time playing video games, even though were gamers our self and taking it one day at a time. 

I'm having to be a brother and a parent at the same time and I have to fight with myself and which is which because we didnt grow up together so my wife is usually the one who does the discipline. We've thought about actually adopting and taking action to get the social security so we have financial support but ita just exhausting think about it too. He has told us that he doesn't want to go back because he's genuinely happy with us and doesn't want to go back to his old ways. So I feel like we're semi-doing something right.

My son has always wet the bed. Like, never a dry night, full pull-up every night. I’ve talked to his pediatrician about it repeatedly since he was like 9, but his pedi is unconcerned. Ever male on both sides of the family has been a bedwetter, so his pedi said he wouldn’t really expect anything different and to not worry. We tried alarms, limiting water, everything - nothing worked. I kept buying pull-ups. It’s annoying because they’re expensive, but he didn’t seem bothered, his pedi wasn’t bothered, so I dealt with it. 

Around Christmas time, as a last-ditch effort, I paid $200 for this system that combines exercises with an alarmed mat for the bed, and an online reinforcement system. It required that either myself or my husband sleep on the couch downstairs to hear the alarm in the night, tracking the times he was peeing, etc. Honestly, I had ZERO expectations that it would work, but IT DID. But it took a solid 6-7 weeks of one of us staying downstairs and getting up throughout the night. It was a huge sacrifice but I was so thrilled that he didn’t have to feel embarrassed about sleepovers or camps or friends seeing his pull-ups, etc. He was really happy to be dry every night, and done with the bed wetting. He was dry for several months.

But now it’s summer, and he is back to wetting the bed. I have a hunch it’s because he spends so much more time sleeping now, like he was able to train his body to hold it for 8 hours during the school year, but not 10-11 like he sleeps in the summer. We’ve encouraged him to start up the exercises again and do what worked last time, but he just doesn’t care. We stayed at an Airbnb so I bought another pack of pull-ups so he wouldn’t ruin the mattress, so he’ll just wear those, or just pee all over. He’s terrible about doing his wash afterwards, so his room constantly smells like pee.

I’ve reached the end of my patience because now I know he’s *capable* of holding it, he just has no desire to put in the effort to do the things that worked last time. And I have no desire to start paying for pull-ups or sleeping downstairs for a month or two. 

My husband and my son both have depression - they’re both medicated and doing well but both VERY sensitive to criticism. My husband is still scarred from how badly he feels his dad shamed him about HIS bed wetting, so with all those factors I don’t want to come in like a shrew here. But I’m to the point where I’m ready to say, “Listen, you know that if you do your exercises, drink your water, and get up at a reasonable hour you can stay dry. If you are choosing not to do those things and you’re still wetting the bed, I’m going to start having you pay for your pull-ups out of your allowance.” Is that reasonable or unreasonable?

I have been picking her up weekly for six years. 

My little sister is 15. 

She is a really good kid. It's been a hard few months on me with my medical issues and having to be on medical leave for work. We also did not have our lease approved for another year (I got an emotional support animal) so we are moving in my little sister's town. We got approved for the apartment there and will be putting down the deposit hopefully next week.  We are looking forward to starting an open adoption for an older child through foster care once we get settled. 

I have made sure to ask my little sister if she was ok with this and she seems really on board. We are adopting between the ages 11-15. It will take probably one to two years for the adoption to go through due to meeting and paperwork, ect.  I bring this up because I think she may be feeling insecure about it. I say this because she has been joking about how I have ""unofficially adopted her"" and all types of stuff like that. 

I am teaching my little sister how to drive in case my vision goes out or my body becomes numb. These issues are 70% under control but just in case. One the way to our driving practice spot she starts talking about how no one in her class likes one another and in her health class it is filled with cheerleaders. She then goes onto say that she is planning to steal their papers or take their tests and mark them down with the wrong answers. She keeps going on about how she won't get caught and how much she hates them, ect. Apparently her friend and her are the only two ""non preppy"" people in the health class and they are planning to be against the cheerleaders. Ok, whatever but I need to know if I need to take this seriously and what to do. I pretty much told her it was her life but she shouldn't get cocky because she could get caught and she would have consequences. 

Also, she keeps overestimating herself in driving. She wants to get on the main road but she still needs a little more practice. She keeps telling me that she already knows how to drive and she shouldn't have to practice. Mind you she didn't know how to use turn signals until last lesson and she tells me that my directions are distracting her. It's frustrating.

I split with her dad when she was 13. This was after another on of his affairs, in fact on her 13th birthday he was with his girlfriend and not with us. It was all a mess. 

I tried to co parent, to be honest I lived in fear of him, so generally lived and parented by his rules. Until he decided to get married to the woman he had the affair with. At this point my DD started to make allegations about him. She was seeing a counsellor for some issues with her diabetes and body image but actually it just turned into a place where she could make up new stories and be believed. She did this at school with teachers too. To the point that I had the school phoning me to tell me to cut all contact with her father. This obviously tore the family apart, and much as He had been violent and controlling to me, I knew he hadn’t done that to her. She was telling really damaging lies! I confronted her in a joint counselling session and the psychiatrist told me I was not allowed to question her version of events. I felt powerless. 

At first I tried to help, to understand and one day said enough was enough, she was just trying to hurt her father for a battle that wasn’t her own. The long and the short of it is, that now she’s done the same to me. She made up exactly the same stories but this time about me. She posts lies on social media, she also accused a boy of rape and has ruined his life. The thing is, I don’t believe her. This sounds like something a mother should never say but she doesn’t seem to have a conscience at all. It’s so so scary. 

The social workers told the school to butt out after putting me through rigorous interviews, actually hell. They tried to help us get some mediation but she didn’t turn up. 

I enabled her lies when she was seemingly going through distress, I allowed her to gaslight and manipulate me. I blame myself most of the time but then perhaps that what she wants. Is it really possible for a child you sacrificed everything about yourself for to try and give them a better life to be so hateful? How can she not see the damage she’s done? And how can people let her get away with it. My biggest fear is that she’ll always get away with it and leave a path of destroyed lives behind her and that I was responsible for bringing her into the world.

I went to my local social services and talked to a worker about help and she called food banks and things for charity and NO ONE has the Elecare formula.

Strict rules that are inconsistently enforced, no trust in him to make decisions, no chances for him to make the wrong decision and learn from it, and frequently being *told* how he really thinks or feels about something, rather than being listened to and taken seriously. Mom doesn't even trust him to make his own lunch. They bombard him with their own attitudes about politics and current events, not in a way that encourages active thought and discussion, but rather in such a way that shuts down any idea that anyone who thinks different could possibly be anything other than malicious and evil or a complete moron.

(For context, there are two (now adult) siblings between me and lil bro who were both afforded *way* more trust, autonomy, and real support of their individuality by my parents. Oddly enough, they have both turned out to be far better and more capable adults than I am.)

I see my brother being driven down the exact same path that got me where I am, unable to assert or protect myself, unable to confidently make decisions, utterly unprepared for the world. I was blindsided by the fact that much of what they taught me just doesn't add up with how humans are. I have been immobilized by indecision for years. I've been manipulated and taken advantage of because I was taught not to trust my own judgement. I am only now finally working my way out of this dark pit that they dug for me and it's so painful, exhausting, and humiliating.

Anytime I try to nudge my parents in a different direction, suggest that maybe he's old enough to think for himself, that maybe they are (specifically mom is) suffocating him and that his feelings might be more than just ""teenage rebellion"" it seems like they feel (mom feels) personally attacked. Like I have no idea what I'm talking about because I don't have kids. Like I know nothing because I'm still a kid myself. Like I'm trying to ""poison him"" with my ""liberal agenda.""

I guess basically the question is, are they right? Should I butt out and just resolve to help him through the aftermath as best I can? Is it enough to just listen when he expresses his feelings and frustrations to me because I'm the only person he feels safe to do that with? Should I go the other way? Should I be pushing more? If so, how do I do that without alienating my parents and making it seem like I'm trying to take their little boy away from them?

She lies constantly, even if we know for a fact she took something, she will look us dead in the eye and lie about it until we confront her with evidence. When she's knows she's been had, she just apologizes, says she doesn't know why she keeps doing it. (It's been happening pretty much weekly, she's been grounded for almost 3 months now because she won't stop) We're kind of at a loss, we believe we've tried everything we can. I'm starting to feel like she might be doing it to sabotage my relationship with my partner. I think she may feel like this is serious and she's worried he's going to ""replace"" her dad (he passed away 5 years ago this June) though we've told her time and time again that this is not the case, and he reinforces that with his actions. I'm just hoping for some advice and would like y'all's opinions of how we're dealing with this.

She is grounded, no friends, no phone, we allowed her to keep her tv until last week; she got caught stealing, my partner told her if she kept stealing she wouldn't be able to keep living here, and 2 days later she did it again. So she lost her tv as well. I've got her starting counseling next week, and we're considering trying separate living for a few months to try and separate her from any temptations and hopefully form some good habits while she and I stay with my grandparents. We had a 3 hour family meeting where we all expressed ourselves and I thought it helped, but this was before the incident where she lost her tv, so I guess not. 

I've talked to her about how stealing will ruin her life, smoking weed as a teenager can be detrimental to her brain's development, and that no one is going to want her around if she's constantly stealing, and that's not a good feeling. I told her all she needs to do to get through her last 5 years of being a minor is not steal, not smoke anything in my home, and apply herself at school. That's literally all I'm asking.

Her father was abusive (to me) in her early years but I divorced him 5 years ago after seeking help from social services, and I have been a single mum to 3 since then. Social services have not been involved since, and we were advised that contact was at our own discretion. Their dad spends time with the children maybe once a month (lately it has been more often) and we get along better now than we have before. He has a new partner and so do I, and everything in that department is fine.


I’m having issues with my 12 year old. She’s hit puberty hard and I’m really struggling to get through. She’s moody, angry, frustrated and aggressive, especially towards her younger siblings.


We live in a small, three bedroomed council flat, in which she shares a room with her younger sister (8). I’m a full-time carer to my disabled brother and a part-time student, so money is always an issue.


My two younger children (1 girl, 1 boy), go to primary school that’s a 40 minute walk (one way) away, and I’m always exhausted when I come home from the school run. Basically, I’m always doing something and I’m very tired, so I’m not as available for fun as I would like to be. That said, I always try to spend time with my children, doing homework, reading, listening about their days and hobbies, and they know that if there’s an issue I will set time aside with just them to talk it out.


However, my issue is that my eldest is weird, and I think maybe has some kind of mental illness. She talks on discord to other (alleged) children her age and they “role play” being demons and devils and whatnot. This frightens me because she doesn’t know these people and some of the things that get said are troubling. I’ve spoken to her about it and she insists it’s harmless and not causing her any problems. 


She has no “in real life” friends, (except for one boy who she says is her “boyfriend” but she isn’t sure of his last name? I’ve never met him). She says that Discord is the only way to talk to her friends. 


I monitor her internet usage through her computer profile and have noticed she has been visiting pornographic sites. I’ve talked to her frankly about the fact masturbation is healthy and pornography (and how damaging it can be) and have since blocked access to such things. She hasn’t said a word about it.


When she misbehaves, I take away her internet privileges, which obviously means she can’t talk online. Her mood then (understandably) takes a dive and she will sulk around the house and take her aggression out on her siblings. I have to intervene in this and try to de-escalate the situation - all of this is expected of course. I was a teenager once and the eldest of 7, so I totally understand and sympathise with her feelings. I introduced her to meditation and breathing techniques in the hope it will help to calm her down.


I’ve talked to her about how feeling anger is okay, but acting aggressively is not. She says she “can’t help it” and has no control. In her role play chats she plays as a girl who is psychotic, and I worry that is affecting her mentally. I don’t know if banning her from discord completely is the way to go?


On more than one occasion she has made up fantasy stories / lies about her real life - she admitted this had happened when a situation escalated and her classmate told her teacher that I was abusing her (I wasn’t). She has told people online that I am dead. She said she does it for attention and that she “wishes [her] life was harder”.


I have been to talk to her teachers several times since she started at this school in September, and she is now part of a “club” that focuses on social skills, hoping that it will help her make friends and understand people better, but the school called me today and want me to go to a meeting tomorrow because they have “some concerns”. I’m afraid she’s made more things up, or that I’m going to be blamed for something. Her lie telling is so believable that she makes me second guess myself. 


In primary school she was such a sociable little girl and had lots of friends who she would see after school and play with, but suddenly she seems more interested in the virtual world. We’ve talked about maybe getting her into a club of some sorts which she actually seems interested in - there is an Air Cadets near where we live, but I am so low on money I’m not sure I would manage.


I’m incredibly anxious about the meeting tomorrow and in way over my head here. Can anybody offer any advice?

My daughter (12) is a HUGE Hamilton fan.  

Not sure exactly how, but she knows all the songs and is constantly going on about how awesome it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I researched taking her to NYC to see it in person, but then I saw how much tickets are and then travel and hotel stays plus meals would make that trip unreasonably pricey.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when I found out it was coming to our metro area as a traveling show.

&amp;#x200B;

Perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Scored two tickets really close to the action, she's excited. I'm excited to have one other thing to experience and share with her.  She is barreling into her teens so I have to strategically position myself so I can walk the fine line between ""squeal"" and ""ugh"" all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

She told her friend. Her friend is now looking for seat near us.

So much for the dad and daughter event.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope her parents are buying 2 seats and planning to come along because if not then this will officially change my status from dad to chaperone.

Here's the DL: My 15 yo son recently moved out of our house into his bio dads. I was with his dad for six years when I was a teenager, till 22. He gave me heroin for the first time, and after two years of homelessness, jail, and crime I broke free from him. I got pregnant the ONE time we had chance encounter sex. I got pregnant, and didn't tell him, after my son was born, Bio was sleeping with my sister and happened to see a pic of my son (who looks a lot like him), so he found us. I was apprehensive, but I heard judge Judy say several times it's healthy for the kid to have a daD, so I let them see each other. I even introduced bio to my new bf, who was like a sister to me, though she was only 17... He proceeded to get her pregnant and had a son, then she split and no one has talked to her since. 
Bio started doing drugs again when my son was four and five. I still let my son see him, with me supervising. I foolishly let bio borrow $400-- never saw it again.
Eventually bio got off drugs again, and him and his younger kid moved in with his mom. My son went there every weekend, no problems. I was finally able to make peace with all of the horrible things bio had done to me. I got married, and my husband and son really didn't get along. My husband comes from a very stern household, so it was hard for him to break that way of life. He didn't beat my son or anything, there was just constantly tension.
When my son was 14, we moved and he was in a new school. Some girl instantly clung to him, and he then started lying and having sex. 
They broke up after a year of drama, and then my dad died. It was a hard time. My husband was very rude to my son one night, all hell broke lose, but eventually he apologized.
One week after my dad died, bio called me and said he wasn't bringing Henry home because Henry needed to stay with him (a forty years old man still living with his mom). I said no way, and called the police, but nothing could be done because we didn't have a custody order.
I tried to reach my son, but he shut me down Everytime, he broke my heart. When I did see him it was obvious he was brainwashed. He wasn't the same. Bio had always been a master manipulator, and he had worked his magic on his own kid. I didn't see my son for three weeks, and I finally said I was going to sit out of their house until he came out.
When I got home after that, there was a stranger at my door. He said 'are you -----?"" I said yes, and he shoved papers at me and ran off. They were custody papers, filled with lies. 
I didn't fight it because #1 I don't have a rich daddy to get a lawyer like bio does (all the trouble we got in I was always the one sitting in jail, while his dad threw cash at the situation so Bio could always be free), and #2 I can't make my son do what he doesn't want to, the courts would just go with what he wants anyway.

Bio FINALLY moved out with an old girlfriend, DJ we will call her. They got married. DJ also has a daughter that is my son's age, who just so happens to have been ""in love"" with my son since she had met him when they were kids. He used to read me some really creepy obsessed texts from her...
 Fast forward months later,
Today I was hanging out with his cousin, who is 17, and I was telling her about how I haven't seen my son in months-- and she told me my son told her two months ago ""that he and DJs daughter have sex all the time, sometimes four times a day. The parents leave them alone all the time, like, ALL THE TIME, so they do it constantly.""
Ask anyone that knows me if I'm a good mom, and the answer is YES. But I can't really do anything about my son sleeping with his step sister, can I? I dunno. I just feel like that is really fucking weird, and unhealthy, no boundaries... Has anyone ever encountered a situation like this? What should I do? Should I text Bio and give him a piece of my mind? I haven't talked to him for three months, the last time I did I lost it on him, it didn't go well...

Granted, she was with her little brother who is 5, when I asked her what she did all day, she said she was up in her room with him, then she took a nap. She didn't even give him a snack.

To give you an example, She cleaned her room 2 days ago, and it's a complete mess again. Clothes and shoes on the floor and all over the place.

Example: 

Me: Does your friend's room look this messy? 
Her: no its clean
Me: ok
Her: but I clean it before people come over, how do I know they aren't doing the same thing? 

Me in my head : THATS NOT THE FUCKING POINT!!

Today she is at a halloween party. I told ger from now on if she doesn't take care her responsibilities at home, she will no longer be allowed to do ___ (record music, go out with friends, etc.) 

I have reason to believe she is not all there mentally, as in she can't read between the lines, takes everything literal word for word..so if i say ""take out the garbage"" She needs me to say ""put the garbage in the big black garbage can and roll it out to the curb"".

I’m a single mother of a 17 year old son. His father left when he was a baby and he has never known him. (I don’t even know if he’s still in the country.) I had him very young and have slowly built up a very good life for us. I am not rich by any means but we live in a nice home and he has always gotten most of the things he’s wanted, within reason. However. He has the most expectant and ungrateful attitude if any child I have EVER known. He will not work although we made a deal that if he got his own car (his grandparents co-signed which makes this even more confusing) he would attain a job and keep it just to have extra spending money as my money is now even more tied up with a new car payment and insurance every month. Well, he never got a job. Constant promises that he’s looking, but nothing. I finally took away his car thinking that would surely that would motivate him because he will be the only one in his group of friends with no car. He didn’t care. Just gets rides from friends. So now I have an extra car that I don’t use that I’m paying on and his grad parties don’t want me to sell it - because they co-signed I don’t think I could anyway. Not sure how that works. I digress. I also found out that he has been cheating in his girlfriend who is an absolute sweetheart, and he has been smoking weed. He has zero motivation or desire to do ANYTHING except skateboard and video games. He does not seem bothered by the fact that he has no money or transportation. I have tried having numerous motivating talks and really trying to get through to him but he flat out doesn’t care. He is almost 18 and I fear he will not even get a job when he graduates.

Why should teens have any reason to be stressed?

Adolescence is a very stressful time for a lot of kids. A study by the John Hopkins University School of Medicine, helps to better understand why mental illness is predominant among young adults.

They worked with young mice who exhibited the genes of mental illness. When they exposed the young mice to stress, they were able to trigger the signs and symptoms associated with mental illness.

Akira Sawa, MD, Phd, a psychiatry professor at John Hopkins Medical Center says, “Having the genes for mental illness puts the mice at risk, but it is not enough to cause mental illness. When you add stress to the equation, at an age when the mouse brain is most similar to the human adolescent brain, the mental illness is triggered.”

This mental illness that is shown in the mice is now seen predominantly in the teens of this century.

Today, in front of the entire band, the director told the other kid, a sophomore, to get in there because he'd be the one marching. When my son asked why, he was just told ""because"". We're all devastated. Family was coming in to town to see him march his senior year. He's spent thousands of hours in rehearsals before and after school. And now he has to go to school, still put in the hours, but push props around.

What do I say to him? I told him to talk to the guidance counselor to drop band if he wants. But what if he can't? How can a 17 year old be expected to take this level of humiliation?

Should I try to talk to the band director? That would probably make it worse I'm afraid.

I feel like my son's senior year is ruined and I'm helpless to make it better. He's been crying off and on all afternoon. His father and I have hugged him and taken him to dinner and offered support for whatever he decides to do.

One of them kids who will come a talk with the grownups, something that I have always appreciated is a child who feels comfortable with adults. 

Recently her mum and stepdad broke up, did the whole yo-yo relationship for a while. Jenny was whiteness to every argument, gets told even more by her mum later and seems to be brushed over unless her mum needs a shoulder to cry on. 

Yesterday Jenny turns up straight from school. Abby and Jenny go upstairs to do their thing for a while then they both come back down to chill with me while I made dinner. Abby said Jenny was in isolation at school which was shocking really. I asked Jenny what she did and she says she was caught drinking with her friends, I asked what her mum had said and her mums response was ""I'm too tired to deal with your stuff"". 
My heart broke for her. I feel this was a cry for attention and her mum is too consumed with her own issues to see how it's bothering her kid. 

I love Jenny like I love my own and can't see her going through pain. I've told her plenty of times my door is always open even if Abby's out. If she needs a quiet place to come chill with free wifi she's welcome to come chill with me or hang in Abby's rooms anytime. I just don't know how to help her right now. I made it clear without coming down hard that drinking in school is just stupid all it does it get you in trouble and waste a perfectly good education, she's a bright kid with a fantastic future ahead if she knuckles down at school but fear right now she's going off the tracks, 

She's also been texting boys. Not a bad thing but the content of some of the msg are a bit more mature than I think is appropriate. None of this behaviour was apparent 6month ago.

Here’s the thing with this. I have a 14 year old daughter who is diagnosed with moderate asthma. She’s had breathing issues since she was a baby, official diagnosis at 4. So she’s been on different rounds of drugs over the years for preventing asthma attacks, steroids, allergy medicine, etc, in addition to her rescue inhaler for an emergency attack. In the summer time, she’s very well controlled. Triggers are low, air has more moisture, etc. Well, it’s getting to be that time of year that always gets bad for her. We live in the Midwest, so there’s a dramatic drop in temperature when we transition from summer to fall and it happens pretty quickly. Cold weather is one of her triggers. October and November are mostly spent in and out of ER’s, taking steroids, etc. February is the worst month. For the last 2 years in a row, in February, she’s ended up in PICU. Once from a bad flare up due to having a cold, once with the flu. She also spent time admitted to the hospital in 2013 when she was 9 from going into respiratory arrest (passed out from lack of oxygen) although it wasn’t in the PICU. 

Now to be completely fair here, I’m sure I’m a little more over protective than I should/need to be with her. She’s almost 15. She knows what she can do and can’t do, can handle and can’t handle, and what’s going to be a trigger and she needs to get away from, if possible. 

Now that I’ve got the preface out of the way, here’s the situation at hand. She goes to a pulmonologist every 3 months. While we’re there, they do a basic check up, listen to her lungs, ask her how she’s doing, do a lung function test, rewrite her scripts and send us on our way. Well, these past few times we’ve gone, her PFT (pulmonary function test) scores have been pretty low. For those who don’t know what that is, it’s basically just taking as much air into your lungs as they can hold and blowing that air out into a tube as fast and hard as you can and until you run out of air. My daughter, being the “I just can’t even” teenager that she is, doesn’t take this test seriously. She doesn’t want to do it, thinks it’s a waste of time, etc. And I don’t always think she puts forth a real effort in doing so. 

So at this last visit, her scores were WAY low. Like lower than they’ve ever been, but she tells the doctor she’s not having any trouble breathing, doesn’t remember the last time she’s used her inhaler, etc. Doc is like, “Nope, something doesn’t make sense here.” So they give her some albuterol and retest. Scores go way up. Doc listens to her lungs, says she sounds clear. Doc says they’re gonna put her on a round of Prednisone (lung steroids) to be cautious. And also tells her something on the test, I don’t remember what, shows she has low levels of medication in her system. Basically looks at my child and tells her she has no reserve air in her lower lungs. So if she were to get a cold right now, etc, it’s likely she’s gonna end up in PICU. Explains the seriousness of taking her medicine everyday, and says, “You can die from asthma. And this is pretty serious.” 

So we get the script and my daughter’s like, “I’m so sick of asthma controlling my life. I’ve taken steroids every year for almost 15 years. This is probably why I’m so short. I hate this, etc.” okay, I understand that. It sucks. She has to be way more careful than most kids her age with being outside, playing sports, being around animals, etc. But I’m like, you have to take control of it and not let it control you. Which means, taking the medicine like you’re supposed to. Just because you feel good today doesn’t mean you don’t take the medicine. Right? Because asthma control medication is not to be taken as needed. It’s to prevent other things FROM being needed. 

Anyways, we start the steroids. Three a day for 5 days (you take all three at once). First 3 days, I basically have to force them down her throat. Now it’s the weekend (last weekend). She wants to go to the football game. Fine, I let her go. Then she wants to stay at her best friends house. Fine, I let her stay. Bring her all her medicine, tell her don’t forget to take it, etc. I text her probably 10 times that night, don’t forget to take the Prednisone. Okay mom, okay, okay, I will as soon as I eat, okay mom, OKAY MOM! Next day guess what? She didn’t take the medicine. So she goes to her dads the next day. I tell him, make her take it. He says ok. I text her another 10 times. Okay mom, I am, I will, okay mom. Comes home Sunday, guess what? 6 pills still in the bottle. So I say fine, that’s it. You’re grounded this weekend. You’re not going anywhere. You can remember to send your Snap streaks everyday but you can’t remember to take the medicine I reminded you 20 times to take in a 2 day period. The freaking lung doctor is telling you WHY you need to take this. You need to be responsible in your own healthcare. You’re gonna be an adult soon and these are things you’ll need to remember to do on your own.

So here it is, Friday, and she wants to go to the game. I tell her no, I said you’re grounded this weekend. I didn’t do anything drastic. Didn’t take her phone or take any privileges away, but I’m making her stay home just because I’m pissed off that she really just flat out ignored me telling her you need to do this. And I’ve been told probably 100 times since she got out of school how unreasonable I’m being. Am I though? Like how unreasonable is it for a parent to care about their child taking medications to keep their lungs open so that if they were to get a cold or something that they could, you know, BREATHE. Her dad thinks I’m being too harsh, her step dad thinks I’m being harsh. Her excuse? I forgot. How did you forget when I blew you up for 2 days telling you to take it? You didn’t forget, you just didn’t do it. I get that teenagers will be teenagers, but this is more than just forgetting to take the trash out. 

I’m not sure I’m looking for actual advice, because I’m standing my ground. She’s not going to that damn game because I already said no and I rarely go back on what I say. I just want to know if anyone else sees my point here? Am I seriously being unreasonable? Because I don’t feel like I am. And I feel like I’m being attacked by everyone around me because I said she can’t go to a damn football game tonight. As for the lesson I’m teaching her? Maybe nothing. You can’t force someone to care. It’s not like she broke phone curfew and I take the phone so she doesn’t do it again and maybe she’ll think twice before she sneaks on her phone past 10:00. She’s 14. As far as she’s concerned, she’s 10 foot and bulletproof and asthma isn’t as serious as we tell her it can be. But you would think spending time in the PICU on round the clock albuterol for 5 days and all the other crap they do that it would make her think a little harder about the fact that this shit can get out of control in the blink of an eye.

It is a big deal, with big consequences. The less opportunities, the less consequences, and the more serious it will be taken. That's how we feel about it.

Hi this is my first post here and I’m not really sure I’ve put it in the right place but I’m really worried about my daughter. She is 19 and has an Instagram page which is becoming more and more like a glamour modelling page all the time. It’s a public page and she has a lot of followers and I’m just really worried about how far this will go as she gets a lot of offers from men to buy her things or send her money and they often want something in return or they can get angry. I feel like she is quite naive but she tells me it is her body and she can do what she wants. She also wants a lot of plastic surgery and I am getting more worried that she will be open to offers from men or ‘photographers’ in order to pay for this. I have spoke to her for years about this but she thinks I am just a mum and I don’t understand. I just want to protect her and I worry that once something is out there online then you can never get rid of it. I am anxious all the time about having these conversations with her as I don’t want it to come across that I am judging her. Does anyone have a similar situation or can offer any helpful advice?

He was an alcoholic.  He died from Cirrhosis and Sepsis.  I realize my daughter has alot she is dealing with.  She has struggled socially since she was little.  She was bullied quite badly when she was in the 4th grade.  In 5th grade she became the bully.  She has become very mean and abusive.  She is bigger than me so when I try and ""make"" her do something, she get physical with me.  

I am a quiet and patient person and have always given her lots of love.  I try and give her space and let her know I'm here if she wants to talk.  She has been through many counselors/therapists.  She is a master manipulator.  It's to the point she refuses to go to school and hasn't left her room (except for bathroom breaks/showers) in three weeks.  She is obsessed with her cell phone.  It's all she does.  I have tried everything to get her to engage...nothing works.

I have been looking into therapeutic boarding schools and wilderness programs. Everything else aside....the cost of these programs is insane.   $50K for three months?!?!   I feel like she needs to be with me especially after losing her dad.  Then I think that since she blames me for so much maybe she needs time away from me.  I go back and forth with every decision I try and make.  I just want her to be happy.  I just read a post where someone's advise was to ""let them be"" and they will ""find their way"".  I sometimes think this is the best thing to do but the more I do that the more disrespectful and hateful she gets.  I have zero help and truly don't know what to do.  She can't stay in her room any longer...that in itself can't be good for her.

Need help on how to help him gain self-esteem and a vision for the future without making him feel lazy and worthless.

My son is an amazing guy (almost said kid). He's smart, thoughtful, compassionate, helpful, bold (with other people, not with us). For us...he is lazy, has no motivation to tackle any kind of project or goal, always does just the minimum to get by, has lost his vision for the future. I get frustrated because he doesn't contribute much around the house, but feels entitled to everything for doing nothing. When I point that out, he goes to a dark place of self-loathing, worthlessness, and he demonstrates a fatalistic world view.

The modern era has been pretty tough on kids these days. I actually love millennials, they are so smart and creative, they generally have strong values and a good sense of right and wrong. But in these post-truth days, it's hard for them to hold on to hope for the future which is essential to creating a sense of purpose and meaning.

So, when the conversation turns towards any discussion of his plans, his future, his life or when I get frustrated because he is so damn lazy that he won't do anything for himself or anyone else he begins to demonstrate this very dark world view, he starts spouting vitriol and saying things that he clearly does not believe, and he loses all hope and he begins loathing his own existence.

It is a vicious cycle, because I must admit, sometimes I can be a dick. I get frustrated, I won't tolerate him saying those things, that I know he doesn't believe (ie. like F\* the police, they're all killers and racists). And I confront him with his BS. I do cuss sometimes and I do get angry and frustrated. I make sure to tell him that I'm not made at him, the things he is saying, the feelings he is expressing are not him, but what he is doing, what he is feeling is not OK and he needs to fix it. This sends him into a depression for a few days.

I am constantly looking for opportunities to praise him, but any positive feedback I give him makes him feel worse! He says it sounds condescending. I thank him for even the smallest contribution and he hates it because he knows it wasn't a contribution. This makes me think that he is subconsciously NOT contributing to the household or making an effort with his life because he's afraid of doing something that I truly can be proud of. 

I don't think he has ever forgiven me for moving our family across the country and making him start high school in a whole new community and he is subconsciously trying to punish me by making sure he never does something I can be proud of. He will occasionally want to pick up a new hobby (mountainbiking), and I get so excited that I immediately buy him the equipment he needs and begin praising him. Which immediately prompts him to entirely give up on that hobby.

Doesn't help that he smokes pot and drinks alcohol occasionally. He's VERY open with me about his use of substances, partly because we do have open lines of communication, which I've worked very hard and made many compromises to keep open; but partly because he knows that if he openly tells me about his drug and alcohol use, he knows that it hurts me. Wouldn't mind some advice on this issue too. I don't think his pot/alcohol use is super-high risk, certainly he is far more in control than most of his friends and other college kids his age, but it is high-risk use at his age and it scares the hell out of me that he's going to (maybe already has) gotten addicted.

So, how do I break this vicious cycle? I need to find a way to get him to see hope in the future, find something to do that he loves and will sink his teeth into, demonstrate that I value his contribution to the family and I'm hurt when he won't do his fair share around the house, and get him to find something other than partying brings him any joy. 

I consider myself an excellent communicator, advisor, mentor and role model. But with him, sometimes I lose it and get so frustrated I yell at him. That sure doesn't help. But I feel like I need to yell at him to get him to snap out of it! Because I know that that is not who he is, not what he believes, not what he wants for his life. I know that deep inside he wants to be happy, he wants to accomplish great things, he is a natural born helper (in the Mr. Rogers sense of the word). 

This depressing pattern has gone on too long and I need to find a new way to ride-out these mini-storms. I need some new tools for helping him see that he has a great future. I've given him everything he's ever wanted or needed (and yes, that does imply that he is ""spoiled"" and that's probably true to some degree). I need to find a way to instill a work ethic, learn how to delay gratification, understand that good things don't come easy or free, and the best and most important things in life are love, family, and contributing to a better world. I think I live this with my life, but he clearly rejects everything about me and my life (I think because I hurt him with the move and he can't forgive me for that).

We do have a good relationship. We hug all the time, tell each other ""love you"", and are almost always able to have gigantic, convoluted and fascinating conversations on nearly any topic. But if the topic turns to his life, his goals, his future, he immediately shuts down. If I push it and want to talk about his future, his work ethic, his contribution (even just around the house, like helping with chores), the cycle starts all over, takes a couple of days to work out. Then we're back to square one.

Anyway, it just helps to write this all out. Trying to get it out of my head because it's literally tearing me apart and I can't stop thinking about it or worrying. Look forward to your thoughts.

I have a crisis right now and I need advice/suggestions or at least understand what I am going through.  So today marked the 5th time that my daughter put her hands on me and I am so broken by it.  I feel like a complete failure at parenting because I’ve raised a disrespectful human.  

She has been displaying rage for a few months where if I ask her to clean her room or do anything she slams the door on my face, or we’ll get into a screaming match.  One time I was driving and when I approached her about her failing a class she smacked me in the face.  I was just trying to be a tough mom/ disciplinarian and I had to quickly park the car to diffuse the situation. 

After today’s episode of physical altercation (I had to defend myself because she’s bigger than me).  After we both cooked off, I took her to the local crisis center. 

The social worker interviewed me and someone else interviewed her about what happened. I was told to seek help with a local program for my anxiety/anger and insomnia.  She was also set up to get help with a service that sends counselors to the house every week for adjustment behavior.  

They also said they were going to report it to child protective services and when they asked me if I hit her back I told them the truth.  I am so hurt and although I know I did the right thing by seeking help, I’m afraid for the unknown. 

My daughter is such a smart person but she is soooo strong willed and stubborn.  Tomorrow starts the counseling session but this stress is getting the best of me.  I love my daughter and I want her to have a happy and healthy life but I know my limitations with anxiety and I don’t want to ever hurt her.  I need advice or to hear of how others dealt with similar issues.  

I’m a single mom and her bio dad is nonexistent.  It’s just the two of us.

Now I know people might be saying why didn’t you get a friends or parents number... i being the worry wart that I am would have but i wasn’t around anyways we show up to the house my husband goes to the door, kid said there was no “daughter name” here. So we instantly freak out. He asked for the parent the mom comes to the door saying she left with 2 boys around 7pm up the street to some apartments to swim. So now we drive over there meanwhile I’m blowing her up and  still no response. We get there and The pool was empty and dark. Go back to the friends house, I get out and talk to the sister there. she gives me one of the boys numbers I tried calling no answer. We drive around then I get a message from her asking to spend the night... our response was helllll no you need to call us now. Then I get a “ plz”.  So we try to get her to call. But she wouldn’t call. Then the friends sister calls us saying she showed up to their house.  by this time it’s 11:45pm. She gets in the car and my husband looses his shit and is yelling and of course she came up with some excuse why she left and it wasn’t her fault yada yada. Now She doesn’t live with us and just comes over for a week or 2 at a time. So as a punishment by husband took the electronics away. But that’s about it. I don’t know what else he should do. And if he should call her mom and let her know. Now a part of of me feels like he’s not going to because this was the first time she actually gave him authority to make a decision on parenting and his daughter goes and pulls this. Now should he let the mom know so she has the same consequences at home as she does here? And besides taking away all electronics what other steps or punishments should he take?

We were always glad to know where they were, good kids all-in-all, very minimal drinking and a little weed, to be honest.

He went on an educational trip for two weeks, came back and immediately broke up with her, swearing off relationships. Well, suddenly, when my husband and I went away overnight last weekend, we noticed a girl visiting on our Ring door camera. She didn't stay long. Last night, she came over while we were home, and our son introduced us for 10 seconds and they went upstairs to the gameroom/kids ' rooms. I went to bed early, and my husband a little later. Neither of us checked to see if she had gone. When I got up, her car was still here. At this point, all we know is her first name and that she's vegan, and her bumper sticker says she loves Colorado. I only know she's old enough to drive. Ok she's just slipped out of the house while I'm writing this. We have always been very strong proponents of open talks about sex, the good and the consequences, and most importantly, preventing disease and unwanted pregnancy. My son is off to college in September (I hope!). He's quiet with a wry sense of humor once you get to know him, and super smart in math.

Now, while I am seeking bereavement and family counselling so we can all deal with this, I am 1000% new to parenting, having had none of my own due to my very queer life. 

My sister, much as I loved, her was anything but stable. She died leaving behind a teen who has rarely known a clean and supportive house where drugs, yelling, mounds of clutter, or frequents moves were not involved - not to mention a lot of homelessness the last year. I am also expecting him to be behind tremendously for his age academically, but we'll investigate more with the schools in the coming weeks and months. He seems to be excited to start living with me and seeing my ex (he's still local and been supportive of everything that's happened since he watched my nephews grow up), but I know the honeymoon will wane and eventually me and a raging 15 year old will butt heads on things. 

While I have a good support network and many resources locally thanks to the area I'm living in, I was hoping some literature/online resources might exist for parenting special needs/teens with trauma to fill in the gaps when we can't see a therapist or go to a support group. Books on parenting in general would be good too. While I am a big reader, most the books I'm finding are for teens coming out of foster care or teens that have grown up with a stable environment with the same parents. But most are for new parents welcoming a newborn into their life.

I'd really appreciate any books, websites, forums, blogs, or reddit threads related to these topics. Or anything else you feel is something that could be helpful.

By
James L. Casale

The current Allstate Insurance commercial airing daily on TV depicts a teenager pleading his case to his parents after he was engaged in a minor fender bender. For me, the commercial is less about Allstate’s accident forgiveness policy and more about a demonstration of effective parenting techniques. Parents, please pay close attention the next time you see it.

The Scene
The parents are sitting up in bed reading as their teenage son enters their room. The boy shows no fear or trepidation. On the contrary, he displays a certain amount of both comfort and cockiness. He states his case eloquently about his fender bender in a narrow drive-through while intimating, but not directly saying, that it is no big deal. Having done his research, the precocious teen proceeds to flatter his parents for being “so smart.” After all, they are Allstate customers who benefit from an accident forgiveness component in their insurance plan.

I See the Seven Cs of Effective Parenting

The parents listen attentively. Their body language is perfect. They are stoic, and there is no grimacing or eye-rolling.  Their eyes never leave their son. They show no emotion; they do not interrupt his plea.

Based on this particular scene, communication in this family is evident. He speaks; they listen. All this occurs while each family member remains calm and civil. If parents expect their children to be calm and civil, they must model these characteristics and many others with planned consistency. Kids learn by what they see and not by what is preached to them. We all may have our moments, but consistency, which requires collaboration between parents and a consistent devotion to a parenting plan, is a key ingredient of successful parenting.

The fact that this teenager would enter his parents’ bedroom and initiate this discussion reveals more than just the ability to communicate in this family. It also reveals a connectedness among family members that is characterized by trust, confidence, and open-mindedness. Trust must be part of the family culture if raising lifelong learners, men and women of character, and good citizens are the goals. 

After listening intently, showing no emotion or negative body language, and allowing their son to conclude his case, his mother calmly says, “Four weeks without the car.” Hearing the verdict and accepting the decision, the teen executes a perfect 180 and says, “OK, goodnight,” and then he hustles back to his room. They speak; he listens. Communication and connectedness rule.

Among all the other positive techniques displayed throughout this commercial, mom and dad also exhibit a commitment to work with each other and execute a plan that includes all of the above boldfaced Cs as well as providing consequences as they see fit. 

Parenting Is Not Easy

As comedian Jim Gaffigan said, “Most of the time, I feel totally unqualified to be a parent. I call those times being awake.” If you are a parent, you already know this, and I want to add that it takes courage to be a parent especially in the rough seas of the 21st century. These are the seas where distractions are limitlessness, where electronic devices rob our children of their childhoods, where face-to-face socializing is passé, where kids are not building forts, playing in empty lots, or enjoying nature, where the self-esteem movement seems to rule our public schools and our homes, where everybody gets a trophy, and where our college students need safe places, counselors, and now “baby goats” (University of Maine) to relieve their stress.

I exhort my fellow parents to hold your heads up high, walk tall, talk straight, coddle less, model your expectations, allow your children to suffer the consequences of inappropriate behavior, create a family mission statement that establishes a culture of learning at home, and devise a plan that includes the seven Cs of common-sense parenting. These tenets will help parents navigate the parenting journey.

Dr. Casale is both a state and national award-winning educator and the author of the highly praised book published by Skyhorse Publishing, Wise Up and Be the Solution: How to Create a Culture of Learning at Home and Guide Your Child to Succeed in School and Life. His second parenting book, Family Pledge: Raising Lifelong Learners and Good Citizens, has also received rave reviews. Both books are available on his website, jamescasalephd.com, in book stores, and online in print and eBook versions.

Your child: “Almost” (hasn't started and doesn't plan on turning it in) 

Does this sounds familiar? 

You work hard. VERY HARD to get the best for your child. The best clothes, the gadgets and most of all, the best education. You have looked for mentors and tutors to help. You have talked to the teachers and have been to the school. However, you are still having the same issues. Your beloved child is still struggling, not being attentive in class, and not earning the grades you KNOW they can earn. 

What is the problem??? 

I have been a tutor and Academic Coach for 5 years to teens all over America that have had the same challenges that your child does. From my study and experience, I have found many insights that crack the code to what the real issue is. 

It's not the learning dis-ability label 

Past the ADD or ADHD label 

Past the Autism label 

The real issue is that your child does NOT belong in that school. I'm not saying that your child cannot be successful in that school, but they do not belong. 

Picture this. In order to create the circus experience, human beings would go into the wild to capture Elephants and train them to follow their instructions for the amusement of a crowd. Elephants CAN master the act of following instructions, but is that their natural role in the world? To amuse us? No. For instance, the African Elephant's role in their environment is to pull down trees and break up thorny bushes, so that other animals can survive. They also use their tusks to create water holes in dry river beds. The Asian Elephant prevents the overgrowth of vegetation while spreading the seeds of the vegetation is eats. When an African or Asian Elephant is taken from its habitat, they can't do their jobs and therefore, put more work on other Elephants and negatively impact their natural environments and the animals they naturally live with. 

Your child was born into this world with an innate role in society. You know what your child is good at. Do they write well? Are they great at building things? Can they sing? Can they dance? Can they make connections between abstract and logical ideas to come up with new and creative solutions for existing problems? Whatever it is, that thing that they are good at is WHY they are here. It is their gift. It is the raw material they were given to build a great life. Their talent. 

However, our institutions don't really value that. Our institutions value the structures put in place to build a civilization. To build a man made ECOsystem or ECOnomy. The thing is that we are to work in harmony with natural ecosystems not create our own version of nature. But here we are.

The current public education system works for what it was made for. It's perfect for training human beings to respond to authority in a specific way. It's perfect for training humans to learn commands, to be on time, to follow the rules, to learn discipline. These things aren’t all bad, but sometimes you need to break the rules and follow your on command in order to contribute to humanity in a more meaningful way. 

When you really look at society, we do many things to feed our addictions (or traditions). We have huge department stores to feed our addiction of material consumption. We have tons of restaurants to feed our addiction to food. Hell, now we have tons of websites online to feed our addiction to information. Why are we so addicted? Why do we need more and more? What are we looking for? Well, we aren’t looking for anything. It's what we are running from. It's that feeling that we should be doing something else. That yearning to change it all today and do what we really came here to do. That talent. That innate gift that we have and wants to be unleashed on the world. That potential. That power that is suppressed in our kids. For the sake of conformity to society. 

Now I’m not saying that society is all bad, but we have gotten to a point where the has be sacrificed for the whole. NOW, your kids aren’t having that. What we are seeing now, is a new generation that has a tough, but exciting road ahead. They have to correct the mistakes of yesterday and create a greater harmony with the planet today. Therefore, their talents are not made for the traditional school construct. Thankfully today’s society is changing to reflect their talents. Their outside of the box thinking. Their outside of the box learning and expression. They are different, yes, but they must not be contained or suppressed, especially with medication. They must be liberated and fearlessly supported in their pursuits.

It's not easy for you. I know. You don’t know the future and you want the best for them. However, you must trust yourself and trust your child. See their true intentions, values and beliefs. Let them know that you believe in them. Let them know that nothing is inherently wrong with them. Let them know that they are valuable and have something to contribute. You love them. Nothing is wrong with them. They are valuable. Don’t let school ruin your child’s confidence to be who they truly are. The world needs your child.

I am helping my BF raise his two daughters full time, along with my own daughter. The younger two girls(11 &amp;13) and pretty great kids. Normal kid stuff but tolerable. The older girl(15) has progressively gotten to be more and more trouble. She was nine when we moved in together. At that point she would fabricate crazy stories, hung out with other mean kids, she would sneak around, take food(like eating half a jar of pickles instead of the healthy meal I prepared), she was obsessed with murder and forensic shows and she would lie about so much(and so well). She had a therapist at the time, who she decided to stop seeing, and the therapist supported her stopping therapy. As every year progresses her behaviour has gotten more sneaky and manipulative. We’ve tried to raise her in a living way, include her, guide her, be a good example. We are peace loving hippy type parents(we meditate for goodness sakes). We invite her to join in things, try to hug and love her. She hides in her room all the time(has done so since 9) and tells people we don’t include her. We don’t love her. When we are always trying, only to be told she doesn’t hug, or she doesn’t talk or whatever her reason of the day is. She would take things she wanted and when found out(or found in her room), she would outright deny it. When she started her period at 12 we asked her if she had any questions and she denied even starting her period. Told her we had to know so we could purchase her supplies(but she never would tell us and to this day suspect she probably stole her pads and tampons). I found bloody sheets and underwear tucked in the back of our linen closet and she still denied it. She would flush pads down the toilet and deny it. We found a corner full of used pads in her bedroom when we moved. All the while denying it. She started sneaking out of the house at 12, stealing from stores(caught and brought back by the RCMP),  I would suspect things were happening but every time it was brought up she would deny it. She started smoking at 12 and we found half a cigarette in her drawer that she denied as hers. All this time I’m very aware of what’s happening but she lies so easily that Dad wanted to believe her and I started to feel like I was the crazy one. At 13 she started self harming if she got caught doing something she shouldn’t do or if we wouldn’t allow her to do something. I brought structure and boundaries so we thought it was just rebellion against me. But Dad always wanted to believe the best in her so there was never any real consequences to any of it. Fast forward to last year when she got caught for cyber bullying(we found out because he kids Mom and aunt showed up at my house and tore a strip off me, in front of all my neighbours). We took away her phone and attempted to ground her but then she goes to self harm( superficial scratches and as assessed by therapist number 4 and 5 as a way to gain the upper hand on us). Her dad took her to the hospital after the last incident and she lived with her grandparents for four months. Where she continued with therapist number 5. We thought things were getting better. Laid some ground rules to come home(no threats of self harm, be respectful, no drinking, no drugs, no stealing and basically be a good human being). We all start going to group(DBT) classes and she comes home. Things SEEM to be going well. We, in response to the classes, attempted to be more trusting and give her the benefit of the doubt. Things seemed to have changed. Then she asked to have a party at our house. We were so proud of her we allowed it but with rules to be followed and we would be home but make ourselves scarce. Turns out they were sneaking drinking, vaping in our house and when caught they all lied to us. We kicked everyone out and had a calm chat. A couple days later we find out pics were posted to Instagram of them drinking and vaping and we caked them out on it. Calmly. She told us her friends mom bought them logout and she told her that we had alcohol readily available. We were going to call the police on the  Mom and a she was going to call on us. Her dad got a furious call from the other mom and he said he wouldn’t talk to her if she was just going to yell. It took three calls but she called down and they chatted. Turns out it was more lies and they had a friend purchase alcohol for them. This upset her dad and she threatened self harm and ran away to her cousins. Telling people she was scared of her dad and making it out like he was going to beat her. Never has he ever. He did slap her one time when she was arrested at 12. So he calls the police to have her returned home( and so he could once agin take her to the hospital if she was going to self harm). The police said they couldn’t make her come home.so she stayed at her cousins. In the meantime she admits to gong in our room and stealing from us, she admits to stealing some liquor from her grandparents(turns out it was actually A LOT). And her dad has basically said she can’t come home if she’s going to use lies and threats as a way to do whatever she wants. My daughter is scared of her(she has threatened her), and feels sick every time it’s her week to come to our place. Everyone is always on edge and honestly no one feels particularly safe. However because she is 15 the police can’t make her come home but they can force us to take her back in. Right now she’s safe where she is(but she is filling their heads full of lies about us and they are filling her head with the idea hat we are terrible parents). He will contact child protective services when they open to find out what to do, but at this point we are at our wits end. 5 therapists, gentle love, talking, guiding, tough love, yelling, everything, we’ve tried everything and nothing works with this kid. If she comes home we all will be under her control again, because she clearly can do whatever she wants without any real consequences.  Her dad did finally start seeing what she’s been doing for years but it’s almost too little too late. And of course I get blamed for everything when all I’ve ever done is try to love and provide a structured stable environment with expectations. I’ve even offered to leave the home if I’m really the problem. This has just been a skim of the hints that have happened over the last few years but I honk you get the picture. Now she is smoking weed, drinking, vaping, having sex(we found condoms) and she asked to go on BC as well as lying and manipulating us to get what she wants. 
We are legally responsible for her in Canada until she is 16, so if you have any advice it would be great. If not and you made it to this point thanks for reading. I just really needed to vent and hope we aren’t alone in this.

Is making your teenage child sleep on the couch without allowing them to get up from the couch after a certain hour, even to go to the restroom, through the threat of selling all of that child's furniture, as punishment, considered child abuse? Two so far have said yes. One has said ""Not really"". Another asked for more information, so here it is. 

https://www.quora.com/Is-making-your-teenage-child-sleep-on-the-couch-without-allowing-them-to-get-up-from-the-couch-after-a-certain-hour-even-to-go-to-the-restroom-through-the-threat-of-selling-all-of-that-childs-furniture-as-punishment

This is happening to my 15-year-old girlfriend (I'm 16). Her parents threatened to sell all furniture in her room if she did not sleep on the couch for TWO WEEKS or until they move in MARCH or later, and when she got on the couch at 9 p.m. she could not leave that couch, even to go to the bathroom. Doing so would risk losing her bed, drawers, everything. And get this: she's being punished for speaking her mind, confiding in her mother, telling her that she feels unsafe around her and that she makes her really, really sad. Her mother did not take it well (as often parents do because parents many times cannot seem to understand) and extended this punishment she originally was given because she went to bed at 10 rather than 9 on a school night. My girlfriend has also told me that at times, they'll even make her sleep outside, but that's not too common. These Mormon parents force her to go to church, missionary prep, etc. when she doesn't think of herself as Mormon, for she believes the religion to be sexist and old-minded. As Mormons, the stereotype would seem to suggest that they're nice, friendly, and loving; however, from what I have witnessed (when going to her house) and from what I have heard, her parents are truly unsafe to be around. Here's a list of evidence:

         1) They hit their children as punishment. This is many times not considered abuse, though personally, I 
             consider it as such. 

         2) They cover their children's mouths to cover their screams. I saw this first hand, though mildly when my 
              girlfriend's little sister was screaming about wanting to season the pasta they were making at that 
              moment, and her dad came up behind her and told her ""Shhh, hush"" while covering her mouth and nose 
             with his hand. At worst, after her mom hit her 
             with a wooden spoon for a misunderstanding (so she did nothing wrong), and she began saying how upset 
             she was, my girlfriend was restrained by her father, mouth covered. She responded by hitting her dad by 
             accident, trying to get away from him, yelling ""don't touch me, don't touch me!"" to which he said ""I can 
             touch you whenever I wanna"", and then he made her sit outside for two hours as punishment for hitting 
             him. 
        3) They make them sleep on the couch or even threaten to make them sleep outside
            as punishment, and as I've already 
            said, she's being threatened with losing her furniture, 
           which I wouldn't put past them since they're already moving into a new house in a few months (maybe 
           instead of selling it, they'd just move it to the new house and leave her furniture-less for those months)

         4) They will physically drag my girlfriend to church and other Mormon activities, even though she has told 
         them she doesn't believe the same things multiple times. When she does resist, she gets in big trouble, loses 
         privileges, and finally, gets verbally abused and literally dragged by the wrist. 

        5) The father is always incredibly busy in his office (one time my gf got trapped in their chicken coop and 
        yelled for an hour and 30 minutes for help, got no reaction because only her father was home in his office, 
        and ultimitely 
        had to break the door to get out, to which her father yelled at her for doing. What was she going to do, sit 
        there until her mother got home???) , the mother is constantly doing her own thing outside the house, the 
        bigger brother has terrible anger issues, and they have three little kids running around everywhere with little 
        to no supervision.

       6) They have no respect for their children, mostly my girlfriend, who they treat like a housemaid (she does all 
       the laundry, watches over the kids, etc.), downgrade her/put her down (literally today her mother told her she 
       would end up working at McDonald's), and have no respect for what she has to say (every time she speaks 
       up, she gets hit, or punished in some demeaning way). Furthermore, they leave her no privacy. They read 
       through her texts every night, and recently they took her phone away completely (forever, it seems) just 
       because she was using it in her room with the door closed. (It's actually been really difficult to keep in touch 
       this last week because she's been sleeping on the couch with no phone, so we can't even skype at night.)

She cries all the time, and she's miserable. She has a history of severe-ass depression (and I mean that BAD shit, like, she felt NUMB.) and I worry every day that one day it'll come back for good. She's felt numb every now and then recently. Her parents are killing her, mentally, and without any way to really contact her other than driving to her house, I can't really be there to support her as much as I'd like to. She's said multiple times that she wishes she could leave that hellhole, but if she did, she'd desperately miss her baby brother, the person she loves most in the world. Additionally, she recently told me that her parents may make her share a room with her 16 year-old brother in the new house.

Anyways, what are your opinions? Is this child abuse? Could I help her? Get her out of there, if she truly wanted to? 

Sincerely, 

Me. ",,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,,public,self,"A call to action against these ""people""?

i'm 15 right now, turn 16 in about 2 months, and i have struggled with mental illness for about 3 years. right now, i'm in counseling, on meds, and i'm the happiness i've ever been in a long, long time. it's taken a lot of hard work and support to get to this point, but i can remember when things weren't as easy, especially for my father. 

before i reached for help with my depression, i knew for a long time that something was wrong. i was always a bumbling child, social and bright and fast, but that summer, it was like i had hit a spot of slow wifi and began to buffer. i laughed at less things, stayed in bed for days, keep more thoughts to myself, spoke less, listened to more lana del rey lol. i felt muted, and dead, in simple terms. 

this didn't make much sense to my father, however. whenever he saw me sulking around in a puddle of my darkness, he didn't hesitate to chastise me, bothering me and telling me how good i had it. i didn't have cancer, i had no reason to be sad, inside, in bed. it drove him bonkers. he'd ridicule and mock me, maybe because he just saw it as teen angst or something. but i don't think he understood it, so it made him angry. however, that all changed one day -- inside of a fucking walmart. 

we were visiting my brother at college and shopping for groceries for his dorm at the local walmart. i was in a terrible bout for the weekend, and my dad was certainly not having it. i don't know what exactly he said to me, but i knew at one point, i was done with it. i had enough of being blamed and shamed for something i could not control, something i did not get a say in, so i said it. crying, in the middle of a walmart, i said, ""i think i have depression."" it shut him up immediately. he felt guilty and probably embarrassed because he had no idea. he apologized to me. by the next day, he started looking for a therapist. 

i guess im writing this because i just want to say something to the parents of teenagers out here, just because i've witnessed it first hand. you have to be patient. you can never assume you /think/ you know what's happening. it's common to think you have an idea of what's going on with your child because you've read about it, or you've heard rumors, or because you were a child yourself. but unfortunately, you just don't. you don't know what is going on inside of them. you never will know what they are going through. you won't. it's no one's fault, but since your child is a completely different person than you are/were, living in a completely different time period, there are things you just will not relate to you have no idea what they are thinking, not matter how well you know your child. of course you don't want your child to suffer, and it's hard to help them when you have literally no idea how to start. but in order to be a parent sometimes, you've got to work blind. it is terribly, terribly unfair. however, fairness was not the thing you signed up for. it was parenthood. i think a lot of us, people, i mean, we think that life gets easier as we age. it doesn't. we just get better at handling it. we become wiser, and smarter. we gain strategy and work ethic. we gain faith. that's you need in a time where you have no idea what's going on. after you making it clear that they have options of how to get better, you need to trust your kid. because no one knows themselves better than they do. 

you don't have to understand. that's not your job. 

be patient. don't make assumptions. be open minded. don't tell them that you're there, just be there. don't chase ignorance because you think you have a grasp on something. be aware. get them help if they need it. patience is uncomfortable, it is not easy, but then again, the important things never are.

She just turned 13 last month and I fear the next 5 years if I can not find a way to get through to her as we have tried everything we know. From hardcore grounding, to gentle pleading talks which seem to go in one ear and out the other. Here is some background to current info to understand the problem.


When our daughter was born we decided I would stay home to raise her while he worked to support the family (we both were latchkey kids and hated it). It was not an easy decision as we knew our budget would be very tight but to us it is worth it. We used this as an example among other things to teach her there would be tough choices in life and to not make rash decisions and to think a problem through with benefits and concicinses. Over the years we have tried to teach the importance of please and thank-you, giving to those in need (once a year we go through the house and fill boxes with clothes that don't fit and stuff we don't use and take it to goodwill. We let her do her own items.), and only take help if you really need the help, which we live by this ourselves. I will admit that I am a over-protective, and kind of strict mom that will not let her wear high heels, skirts/shorts above the knee, revealing or lacy (aka sexy) clothing. She knows that she can choose to have her ears pierced and wear makeup/nail polish when she turns 16-17. Both me and my husband are very introverted people and only have a couple of friends each (which I now realize was a mistake) so she did not have play dates or sleepovers, which according to the school has put her socially behind. I regret this, but I had been hurt so many times in the past by people that I avoid them. Now I will give you the problem I am having and so desperately want to fix as I fear for her future if I can't.


She has a violent temper (I did as a child also). When she is grounded or asked to do something she does not want to do she will scream and/or hit herself. I have talked to her about it many times, even telling her about my own temper and how I had learned to control it. I also told her what worked for me may not work for her and she would have to find what works for her. We searched the internet for different ways to try, but she does not seem to even be trying.


We have tried to teach her that nothing in life is free and that you must work hard for things you want in life. But she seems to have a sense of entitlement (I think she is getting this from kids at school) as she has stated that she should not have to do anything at home. The only thing we ask of her is that she clean her own room, do her homework, and one chore a day (such as taking out the trash, or loading the dishwasher and putting away the load before). When reminded she drops to the floor and cries, or starts screaming about none of the other kids have to do that. She changes clothes many times a day creating un-needed extra laundry for me to do. She sees how hard we work, but it does not seem to matter to her.


She does not know the value of money. She will use half a bottle of shampoo in the shower or even mix the shampoo with other stuff to “see what happens”. She uses goobs of toothpaste when brushing her teeth. She crumbles deodorant to play with like clay, and much more to long to list here. We have showed her many times the proper amount to use but it seems she just does not care.


A month ago we discovered that she has been going to the bathroom in containers in her room. When we sat down to talk about it she stated that she did not feel like wasting the time to go downstairs to the bathroom. We were horrified and took away computer privileges for 2 weeks, and explained the health concerns and danger this could create. She swears she has stopped but I don't think she has, I think she is finding a way to get rid of it before we find it as her room still has a bad smell to it.

I've been an involved dad all his life, though separated from his mom when he was three. There has been an undertone of conflict between the parents, and parental access has been interrupted a couple of times during his adolescence, which was quite traumatic for us both. 

At nineteen, I think he's still too young to understand the impact that parental alienation has had on our relationship. Sometimes (lately) I wonder if we'll ever get past it. Do normal teens of normal parents (if there's such a thing) ever express affection or appreciation for their moms and dads? I'm lowering my expectations these days.

So not sure even if this is the right thread? Someone recommended that maybe having a rant on here would share knew thoughts or give me a  better understanding of my situation. 

I have 6 children, ages ranging 23, 19, 18,14, 12 and 5 …. 5 boys 1 girl….. the first 3 are from a previous relationship and the 3 youngest are with my current husband. This post is mainly going to be about my 3rd son - he is 18 years old. I think I will just do this in point form as I want to try and keep it as short for you as possible.

2014 (15yrs)

constantly asking girls for nudes which resulted in me having all passwords and constant monitoring. Told him the monitoring would stop when he started behaving and started treating girls with respect.

Getting into fights at school

Constantly in bed on his mb where 90% of the girls were sending him self harm pictures to emotionally blackmail

He got in contact with his biological father (never been a part of his life by choice) and told him that he was being abused by my husband (been his Stepdad since he was 1), the reason? So biological father could pay for his ticket over east to meet a girl he'd fallen for online, because we said no.

taking his 19y old brothers belongings constantly (they share a room) even after being caught on numerous occasions. I even got to the point of having to check his bag every morning before he went to school. (Relationship between the two - terrible)

2016 (17yrs)

His first job was at Maccas, he ended up leaving after a few months because he said he didn't get many hours, I   think it was more the fact that he was doing whatever he wanted and not what the managers wanted.

He started another job, kept that only about a month, because he was constantly on his MB.
He didn't pass his Cert II… all he had left to do to pass was a 2 week work experience. Reason' he met a girl at school (1 or  2 weeks before). Apparently they fell in love. She told him she would miss him too much being at work experience for the two weeks. The work experience place was on the same street as their school, about 2 minutes away! So he stopped going which meant he didn't pass.  We had a big fight that day and he left home. I thought he'd be back in a few days. I was a total mess, but my husband and older children told me not to ask him back. That if he chose to come back it would be under our terms and not his. I felt like I was in a black pit for that whole month. I was useless to everyone. I wasn't a mother or a wife. I was just a big pile of useless crap. Every time I tried to defend his actions, everyone kept shovelling crap over my head.



2017 (18yrs)

He did a short 6 month pre apprenticeship course but hasn't  put much effort into finding an apprenticeship or job.

Happy to stay in bed all day and night on his mb ad come out for toilet, meal breaks 

He does however help with chores when asked

Does very childish immature dangerous things, eg; jumping off bridges and posting it on social media and telling everyone he broke his leg….. wasn't fun reading it - even if it was a joke!

Not positive but 95% sure he's on some sort of drugs…. I don't think it's the hard stuff but that could be a matter of time.

He hangs around people that probably don't help the situation, random juvi parties, drinking, smoking - you name it. I get that he's now legal and I don't want him to not live and have fun but there are limits.

I just found out he is fooling around with a 14 yr old (not the 1st or 2nd time). Spoke to him and told him about the legalities and at first he denied it, then shrugged it off…. 

He usually is in 4 or 5 relationships at one time. 

Keeps coming home with new clothes etc so God knows what he's done in order to get them.

Recently found cut scars on his wrist, when I asked him about it, he snapped at me saying you know about them and I don't want to talk about them and walked off. My gut tells me they are for attention but at the end of the day, I feel like I know nothing.

So I told him yesterday, that he had a choice to make. That either he or we get therapy to sort out these issues or he needs to move out. He has 3 younger siblings and I don't want his behaviours affecting anyone anymore than it already has. He has a 14 yr old sister who loves and adores him, but he's disrespecting females left right and centre, than he's not the best person to have around. He also has 2 younger brothers, and I don't want them thinking this behaviour is accepted here. 

He has never really disrespected me, as in yell at me or be rude to me intentionally. He still kisses me goodnight. He still says he loves me. 

His relationship with his stepdad is generally ok, although the last few years with his antics and the whole abuse thing has probably not helped. I get that my husband isn't happy with the situation and I can't blame him. 

His relationship with his older brothers is non existent - they have tried. But when you're constantly stealing from one I guess it's hard.

I just don't know if I've done the right thing. My head is saying yes and it's time to see things for what they are…. But my heart sees him as my chubby cheeked little monkey. What didn't I do? What did I miss? There is obviously something that we didn't give him along the way. What can I do now? Does anyone have any advice please?

He often bunks school (my parents have been notified many times) and yesterday was taken home in a police car after being caught stealing from tesco. 

My parents are well aware of everything and are taking no precautions in doing anything. My brother has caused trouble for a long time and they simply say they have given up on him and any mistakes he makes are on him and they don't want to have anything to do with him.

I am his older sister (19) and feel that if my parents won't do anything, I have to be responsible. It is also frustrating because when I was 14, my parents found out I had a boyfriend and my phone, laptop and all means of communication were confiscated for an entire year. I was never allowed out and was not allowed to have friends over, this carried on until I was 18. My parents were extremely strict and I have never tried drugs or smoking and only tried alcohol for the first time when I turned 18, and even now I drink responsibly. 

Anyway, my brother has never had any discipline and he does not fear my parents, even after being arrested he got back and nothing was said to him. I went to see him and he just bragged to me about how 'the police didnt do shit' and how he got away with it all and he's been doing it for half a year. 

He is constantly being held in detentions and being put out of lessons in school and still that doesn't affect him. He thinks he knows it all and when I try to talk to him I'm just a 'dumb bitch who doesn't know shit'. 

I went through his phone and also found messages between him and his friends discussing how they were going to lie to their parents about sleeping round each others when they were actually going to stay the night at a hotel with a couple of girls from their school and do drugs. 

How do I do something about this all?",,False,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,,,self,How do I discipline a teenager?,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/6o7rcp/how_do_i_discipline_a_teenager/,,{},,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,False,,,,,,,1487340581.0

He has been smoking weed with his friends and is being a little shit with his mom and grandparents. My sister is a single mom and she lives with my parents, his dad passed away from an illness when he was three. My sister asked me to give him a drug test, so I did and it came back positive. I had a talk with him about how he needs to apply himself and get good grades so he gets a shot at getting in to college and about the dangers of smoking weed at his age, told him how he needs to stop talking back and being a shit to my parents and his mom. I love my nephew and I'm worried that my sister is too soft with him, he's an only child. She has known the kid was failing his English class with an F since last September, she kind of knew he has been ditching class, and she still rewarded him by buying him stuff, letting him hang out with friends unsupervised, and was going to send him on a trip outside the country but now he has to go to summer school so that was cancelled this week. As I write this I realize my sister is a big part of this mess. But what can I do to help him get his act together? I'd hate to see him waste his life the way he's going.

Everything is normally pretty good. The usual bickering and what have you but nothing out of control. So my 15 year old has decided that she doesn't want to go to her high school anymore. She wants me to transfer her to a public high school where quite a few of her friends go. She currently goes to a private Catholic School, and has attended Catholic school since 1st grade. Keeping her and her brother in private school has been a huge financial commitment on our part. I mean we don't mind, public school did no favors to our kids and we really wanted better for our grandkids. I'm just so tired of the constant fighting about it. Constant demanding that we let her go to this other school. I've told her that I am more than willing to investigate other schools but it will absolutely not be this one in particular as it is literally bottom of the barrel. It's truly just eating me alive... Her and I have always been super, super close and suddenly it's become a battleground. These friends attended school with her last year but couldn't hack the academics and had to leave. She on the other hand is getting good grades and is clearly college  material . Any advice how to get through to her?",,,False,parentingteenagers,t5_3d8sl,,,self,Help with a angry teen,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/53vir3/help_with_a_angry_teen/,,{},,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,1368314179.0
