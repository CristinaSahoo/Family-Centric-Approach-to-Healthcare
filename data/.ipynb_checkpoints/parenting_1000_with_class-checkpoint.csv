I need advice and this is a bit long. My nearly 4 year old son has been having almost weekly playdates with a girl who is a few months older than he is, and they generally get along well and have fun together. But she‚Äôs very physical and tugs him when she wants him to follow her, puts him in headlocks that knock him to the ground, and grabs him around the neck with her hands. These often leave red marks/scratches/bruises on him. If they were isolated occurrences, I would let it go, but they‚Äôre not. I‚Äôve been telling her to stop since it‚Äôs happened so many times, even physically prying her fingers off him. My son also tells her he doesn‚Äôt like it and to stop. The mom is really more of an acquaintance and she also reprimands her daughter, but it happens every single time we get together. This girl has been kicked out of at least 1 preschool because of her behavior. 

Add to that after having these playdates nearly every week, I‚Äôve gotten to know the mom more and frankly, our personalities just don‚Äôt really mesh and I‚Äôm finding them tiresome. She‚Äôs a bullshitter/bragger and know it all. She‚Äôs blunt and lacks tact and a filter. 

Do I tolerate these playdates because my son does seem to enjoy them? I‚Äôve tried to space it out so we‚Äôre only having them every other week, and I do want my son to socialize (especially since he didn‚Äôt start preschool as planned due to covid), but frankly both the mom and daughter are trying my patience. I don‚Äôt want to totally torpedo the relationship because the mom and her husband are part of our local group of friends, but she‚Äôs a overbearing with trying to make plans, combined with the fact that I find her obnoxious. I know the point of the playdates is not for me to have fun. Do I just suck it up and have a conversation with her about maybe having them every other week, and deal with it for a few months? Note that I work part-time so my afternoon are free, and will continue that until my son is in preschool, so I anticipate once he is in preschool full-time and I go back to work full-time, we will not be able to have play dates during the week so it will naturally resolve itselfÔøº.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2848836,public,self,How do I tactfully break up with a ‚Äúmom‚Äù friend whose daughter is physical with my son?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/jcetz2/how_do_i_tactfully_break_up_with_a_mom_friend/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

The concerning details: My 17.5 month old son doesn't point or speak. Sometimes he chooses to run around rather than play with a toy. He doesn't hold things up for us to see. He likes to go up/down stairs and sometimes makes a ""hmmm"" noise when he's tired, stressed, or annoyed. He'll easily imitate some things we do but generally little interest in copying in most other things (hand motions to songs, ""kiss the baby"", mimicking words). Extremely quiet and spaced out when in the stroller.  Frequently ignores when we say ""look"" or point. He's usually not too interested in playing with other kids, but he'll watch them happily or play nearby.

The good details: He claps, waves (appropriately, without prompting), smiles and high fives when we say ""high five!"", has two hand signs we made up for him to tell us he's done or wants more, brings us things to share or for help, has very good eye contact, good name response. Good three point gaze when he sees something funny or weird. Loves hide and seek. He checks in on the playground and pulls me to come with him if I'm sitting on a bench. Has separation anxiety and cries when he sees us leave. He can do simple puzzles and stack five blocks. He gestures to two body parts when we ask. He can follow commands like ""get (name of book) for me"" or ""give me your pacifier"" when he feels like listening. He recently got one word - banana - that he uses appropriately. 

He hit all his gross and fine motor milestones early or on target. He doesn't like to sit still and prefers to explore and climb. Eats heartily and sleeps great. 

I called Early Intervention because every single thing I've read - including the M-CHAT on which he scores ""medium risk"" at 5 or 6 depending on how strict I am - says pointing is \*one of the\* most important indicators of autism. EI said they can't assess him until he's nearly 19 months old. 

Is this too long to wait? I hear the ""act now"" mantra and I am so worried I'm doing a disservice by waiting and not paying big $$$ out of pocket for a private developmental pediatrician (DP). Is an early diagnosis at this age key enough that I shouldn't hesitate to get him help? I found a DP who can see him in three weeks but it will cost half my monthly salary. Obviously I'll pay all that and more to get him help but I'm not sure how much time is of the essence in cases like this.

He mostly does a good job of listening to his coaches and trying to implement their instruction. At home, though, when we play sports that he hasn't participated at in organized leagues, he is very resistant to instruction and would prefer to do things his own way. The issue is that his poor form/poor fundamentals cause him to fail at what he is trying, which causes him to become frustrated, which causes him to give up.

Any tips on how to approach this and help him accept some basic instruction? Should I stop trying and get him real lessons at the sports he is interested in? Or should I just ignore it, let him mess around however he wants, and trust that when he's older he'll be more willing to accept coaching?

Other information that may be helpful:

* I've never been much of a good coach at anything. Even the sports I'm good at I've never been able to help other adults improve their games much. So I am struggling with how to help him.
* I am a very, very laid back parent. I don't get frustrated when he doesn't listen to my coaching, I don't get angry and I don't get upset. I try to be very, very aware of overcoaching and I don't want to be an overbearing parent. I try to keep the instruction I do offer very simple and basic. 
* He is a VERY easy-going kid. Even when he fails at a particular sport, he doesn't really throw tantrums. He just gets frustrated with himself and says he doesn't want to play anymore. And generally speaking, he is a very independent kid and doesn't like being instructed, but he also gives up easily.

* **Make a schedule** \- try to synch their busiest activities during your break time, so you can guide them and keep things safe for them. Also, add nap time to the schedule.
* **Eat together** \- it can be a good breather for both you and your kids.
* **Have time for the outdoors** \- it will give you your much-needed break from the long hours of sitting in front of the computer, and it will give your kids a breather too.
* **Set a reward system** \- so they can be motivated to keep quiet, to do their work, and enjoy while doing them.
* **Follow a sleep schedule** \- kids and adults alike should have enough hours of sleep to be at their best.
* **Talk to kids about your setup** \- making them know of the changes and the structure of your work at home system will help them behave accordingly.

TLDR: I'm well aware that many people don't ""plan"" or ""decide"" to have a second child, it just happens organically. What I'm trying to ask is if those of you who decided to start to try for a second child knew if you were ready or not, and if you had anxieties about it. 

BACKSTORY: Our son is just over 18 months and we had some trouble conceiving him in the first place.  He was a ""spontaneous pregnancy"" after I had been diagnosed with infertility and was going through testing. We are thinking it might be time to start trying for a second, as we would like them around 3-4 years apart if possible, and are well aware it may take a while like it did the first time. However I am struggling to tell if I'm ""ready"" emotionally, just because I'm afraid to sacrifice the one on one quality time with our son, I'm afraid of making him feel left out or jealous or something, and to add to that, I had HG with my first pregnancy. We know we want at least two kids, it just seems difficult to tell when it's time to try for another. How did you think or feel about it?  I can't tell if my anxieties about this are normal or if they're a sign I need to wait.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2848286,public,self,How did you know you were ready for a second child?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/jcbghg/how_did_you_know_you_were_ready_for_a_second_child/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

Trying to work from home and be my 13yo's teacher is the most awful, stressful thing I have ever done - and for context, I'm an OIF vet. I've literally spent over a year actively fighting in a war, have seen people killed and horrifically maimed, and I am more stressed out right now, sitting at my computer in the comfort of my own home than I was when I practically lived in full battle rattle and existed on MREs. At least in Iraq I could look forward to heading back to the FOB once a week. We were based out of Taji and they even had a swimming pool! And pizza! And other grown ups! And most importantly, I knew exactly how to do my job, and knew I was up the challenge, even when it was hard, and sad, and scary, and exhausting. 

Now? Well now I am doing my damnedest, but as Bob said ""They changed Math!!! How could they change math?!!? It's math!""  I've always imagined myself to be pretty smart - I mean, I do have a graduate degree, two, in fact, if you count that MS over there, gathering dust in the corner - but I'll be effed if I can remember how to do pre-algebra. Did I even take pre-algebra in the 7th grade? Have I ever even solved a math problem? Because I cannot do this stuff, and every time the mancub needs help, I inevitably make things worse and we then we both end up frustrated, angry, and sometimes a little teary.

And during the school day itself, exactly how I am supposed to make sure that my kid is tuned in, not just siting in front of his zoom meeting, zoned out and not participating? I'm in a meeting myself! My work didn't just disappear when COVID hit - it actually tripled. I get it, Ms. Teacher Ma'am, that you are frustrated and that you've never trained to teach a bunch of hormonal, bored, isolated kids in a virtual manner. And I completely understand that you are concerned that the mancub does not seem to be ""engaging in the lesson"" and you feel helpless because all the tricks and tactics normally available to you in an in-person environment are suddenly gone, but guess what? Just like I can't sit next to him in school during the day and poke him with a stick every time he tunes out, I cannot sit next to him all day and make sure he is actually participating in your lesson. I cannot make your lesson fun and engaging for you, and cannot magically make you better at using your own virtual conferencing platform. All I can do is make sure he turns on the computer and physically sits in front of it; I can make sure he completes all the assignments posted; and I can ground the bejesus out of him if he skips class or says something rude or offensive. But I cannot make you better at teaching an online class, and I cannot force him to enjoy learning in an online format. I have talked to this kid until I'm blue in the face, I've tried extended periods of active listening and attempting to engage him in a creative process to find a solution that rewards participation, but it just boils down to this: this is a sucky situation and nobody's happy. You, Ms. Teacher Ma'am hate teaching online and frankly, it shows. You are bad at it. The mancub hates learning online, and frankly, it shows. He is bad at it. But as long as he completes his all his work, turns it in, and maintains a passing grade, you, Ms. Teacher Ma'am, need to quit filling my inbox with reports that my kid is not paying attention. I KNOW he's not paying attention, you're class is boring and he's tuned out. It's been six weeks (8 weeks?) and I have done everything I can think of - environment changes, frequent walking breaks together with the dogs so he can get his blood flowing a little, setting up a new sticker chart that gets him ""wins"" every time he gets a good report from a teacher, which he can then trade in for perks and prizes, limiting screen time, increasing screen time, earlier bed times, earlier wakeup times, later wakeup times.

Her 3 year old liked me up until recently when I have been enforcing her bedtime. 

When I met my gf, her toddler would stay up at 3-6am watching tv. My gf has herniated disc so at night time she's bed bound. Since covid hit and everything was closed, and we couldn't go out we kinda just let her do it. She's very obedient kid otherwise so her having this freedom wasn't a big deal. 

However I started working about a month ago and her toddler has woken me up at 4-5am at least times now. One time she let our puppy out and I woke up to a big mess. Recently she woke me up at 5am when I have work at 7am. 


My first try was to turn off her tv, this caused her to bawl her eyes out, bang the floor ect.... I can handle her tantrums but my gf would feel bad, give in and have her come sleep with us. I told her that what she was doing was a harm because now she would want to sleep with us everytime we take away her tv. My gf made the argument that she's had the company of the tv for so long that it feel cruel to just turn it off and let her cry to sleep. Fine.... We put on youtube lullaby music this worked for one night.  Last night we tried it and she just had a tantrum again because it wasn't the tv show she wanted. It was alrdy 1am. We brought her to our room where we keep the tv on since it helps us fall asleep. She was up until 4am.. watching our tv waking me up again...  My gf isn't working so this really aggravated me. 

I also have to mention. Her toddler has been telling random people such as her parents and my gf friend that "" zeusthunder mad"". I mention this child that is bed time and she has to sleep she gets super upset at me and she says that I'm mad at her and she hides in her room. My gf feels bad and thinks I'm being too authoritarian. 

I have never yelled, screamed or hit her kid ever. I just get a tone sometimes, specially with this because I think my gf is harming her by allowing her to stay up all night watching tv and sleep all day during day time.

Not only does she eat very quickly and stuffs her mouth when eating, despite constant redirection and reminders not to (which could be considered fairly normal toddler behavior), but more worryingly, she associates food/hunger with any strong emotion she has, specifically if she is bored or upset but also if she is happy. She is comforted by food and highly enthusiastic about it. 

She has had meltdowns over food and cannot stop herself from asking repeatedly for food whenever she goes to someone‚Äôs house, including having meltdowns over food at other peoples houses when we intervene. Because others don‚Äôt understand the extent of her food obsession she is often offered food we would prefer she doesn‚Äôt have (candy, junky snacks) because other kids are eating it and our concerns are brushed off by other parents as silly and overbearing. For example, recently, we gave her a fruit for snack before arriving somewhere and then she was offered cookies by our host - it is difficult to say no when everyone else has cookies and we look like monster parents for not allowing her to partake( we do allow her a small portion in those instances but afterward she obsessed over it and asks for cookies repeatedly when feeling emotional). 

We are doing our best to model eating slowly and naming her emotions when she claims to be hungry and is clearly upset/bored/etc. We have found that saying yes to something sometimes decreases her interest in it, even so that she sometimes forgets asking for it, but it has not resolved her behavior by any means. If we gave her all the food she asked for she would be highly obese. She still says she is hungry and cries for food on average 3-4 times between meals and asks for food immediately upon waking. She is not fat per se (she looks normal and takes the appropriate size clothing for her age -3T - but her BMI is elevated at approx 18%) as we only give her healthy foods and highly limit her snacking options, so even though we have addressed the problem with her doctor, he was not particularly worried. 

We also noticed that when she was home from school (where food is provided) during quarantine, her weight for her height became normal, and when she returned to school she gained weight again to go back into the ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù BMI category. 

More concerning however is her obsessive behavior around food. Any strategies for helping her become less obsessed would be appreciated.

He's gone through TONS of changes in the past 3/4 months, and I know that can't be easy for anyone let alone a three year old. I know he misses his mom, but she's geographically far away now. He moved to a new city with me and partner and started preschool, and in the middle of all this, we moved to a bigger apartment and he had to change schools. Again, this is only three months ‚Äì it's a lot. He's generally not that difficult of a kid but this morning I feel like I lost my cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

First I went to wake him up for school (I take him in the mornings and partner picks him up at the end of the day) and saw that he had drawn on the wall again...obviously we shouldn't keep the crayons in his room, he's three and can't control himself, but he was coloring the day before and I just forgot. Regardless, he knows he's not supposed to draw on the wall, so I gathered up the crayons and put them in the locked closet which he was very upset about. Then he refused to put on his clothes for school. Then he refused to eat breakfast and kept whining to watch tv, so I told him you can watch tv after you eat. He didn't eat (and there was no tv, obviously), just found a box of nails from the recent move and spilled them all over the floor. By this time we had to run out the door and he refused to put his shoes on. I did my usual thing when he does that and just said ""okay, I'm walking to school, bye!"" and left (hiding just out of view in the stairwell), so he put his shoes on but then when I came out of ""hiding"" he ran back in front of the front door and tore his shoes off. So I put them on by force, and literally carried him crying down the stairs before plopping him down so we could walk the ten minutes to school. The entire time he cried, and tried to drag his feet so he didn't have to walk, so I kind of dragged him along and I had to kind of pull his arm up a bit so that he couldn't drag his feet (this is where I feel like I lost my cool). I would let him walk alone next to me and then he forced himself to fall over ‚Äì this is something he's done before when he didn't want to walk to school. So then I just started half dragging him by his arm again. About 100 yards before the school entrance he just said ""Anna, I'm done crying"" and walked the rest of the way calmly like normal. I plopped him on one of the benches and gave him a kiss and said goodbye and he waited quietly (he often cries at drop off and tries to run to me so he doesn't have to go to school). He did look kind of sad though, and I felt bad for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel kind of crappy because, first of all, no one likes being in a shitty mood. Also I feel crappy because I feel like I was using more physical force than I want to with the dragging him by his arm all the way to school thing. His dad and I are on the same page about discipline, no physical harm ever and consistency and following through with consequences. When he came to us he was having a lot of tantrums and they would be BAD, and he still has tantrums of course ‚Äì he's 3 ‚Äì but he's actually at a point now where he can calm himself down instead of just crying until he's exhausted, which is great. He comes and says sorry now after he's done something he knows he shouldn't, and both partner and I say sorry to him if we've overreacted or yelled. But I just don't know how the hell I was supposed to handle this morning. Partner says he would have done the same thing I did ‚Äì we're going to school, this isn't a negotiation.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that he's going to act this way both because that's just how three year old's are and also with everything he's going through it's normal to act out. We're used to each other's personalities by now but I know he misses his mom, and I know he's probably confused with the move and the new school, and he didn't even know what school was three months ago. But also just what am I supposed to do when he's in full fight mode other than just forcing him through the motions as I did this morning?

I have been struggling with PTSD for over a year. Lockdown made my mental health much much worse. I have 2 boys, ages 8 and 5, the 5 yo is autistic. The lockdown o had the boys here with no contact from anyone for 2¬Ω months, other than their dad coming to stand at the end of the gate for 10 mins once a week. I had them for lockdown for 8 months, with visits to their dads as and when he could 'fit them in' and the restrictions relaxed. My partner had to take the first 2 weeks off work unpaid, because the youngest was sent home with possible covid symptoms but no tests available, even though the symptoms started at their dads house and he still took them to school. 
He lives a 10 minute walk away. No visits except those 10 mins once a week, no phonecalls to them, no asking how they are. 

Well. Their school has just closed for 3+ weeks, with no definite return date. I have insisted that he takes off the first 2 weeks to look after them, and then I will until they can go back for however long it is again. Because I got home yesterday after picking them up and just broke down. I just can't. I can't do it again right now. I have just started therapy after waiting a year for it, just starting to make progress. I have had a crisis team out here 3 times this year and I just really really need to carry on helping myself get better, otherwise I will be no use at all to my boys. 

He said it is in the hands of his manager, he can't afford it, many excuses again. I told him it's not good enough sorry. The lockdown started with myself, my partner and my boys isolating, unpaid, with possible symptoms, because he knew there was symptoms and still took them to school, refusing to pick them up, because 'his job was more important' even though he should have been isolating with them.
I said he can use holiday, sick leave, parental/compassionate leave. And that he can pick them up either after he finished work last night or this morning before 10am as I have an appointment at 10:30. 
He has very angrily agreed. But only I think because his mother has made him. He has also stated that he won't be sending any child support for them this month, because of the pay he will lose. I couldn't care less about the pay tbh. But it's odd how that's the most important part of this to him, when we lost pay and it was just expected.

Anyway. I feel guilty for feeling the need to look after my mental health right now. I feel guilty that I don't think I can cope with another 3+ weeks with my boys, with no support or help from their dad. And I love them so much. But I really just cant. I was shaking and vomiting and hyperventilating and crying after I picked them up. My partner said he thinks that if I have to do it again, I will end up sectioned to help me sort myself out. And I agree. 
But I still feel guilty for my boys. How can I not cope with them? They are gorgeous, amazing boys, pretty well behaved, and I feel like I'm failing them with this.

I find myself checking her breathing often and worrying that her startle reflex is actualy a seizure but I have gotten better at controling those impulses. More recently I have been worried if I ame a got enough parent. Am I feeding her enough? Am I challenging her enough because I often forget to do tummy time with her or Im simply just too tired to interact and talk to her some days. Every time she goes for her shots and checkup I hold my breath that she has picked up enough weight and that there is nothing wrong. Every time our pediatrition tells us everything is great she is healthy and happy and picking up weight fine. She is now almost double her birth weight at 6.2 kgs. Not only is she meeting most of her milestones she seems to be two weeks ahead of most babies. I realized that I need to stop worrying so much one day without tummy time wont hurt her and I'm doing the best I can with what I got.

My 4 year old step child has been hurting themself (scratching until bleeding, hitting themself in the face to cause cuts and red marks, etc) and then reporting that others did it to them (adults and other children alike)

This child does have some possible underlying issues of concerns (hyperactive, lacks attention, lacks concern for others) they have a tendency to deal with all emotions extremely, often deliberately and consistently defiant, etc. Plays aggressively and sometimes violently. Randomly throughout the day they will hit themselves in the head regardless if they are happy, sad, excited, bored. The child is very smart and definitely knows the clear differences between right/wrong, whats nice and mean, and has developed a pretty good set of manipulation techniques. Other children have a difficult time playing with them due to the destructive natue and overwhelming energy (observed with siblings similar in age and at previous day care facility)

They have seen some therapists and doctors over the last year or maybe longer... but due to the child's age, there doesnt seem to be many options.

We have some concerns that a child hurting them self at such a young age just isnt normal and are baffled that a 4 year old would hurt them self and then blame others (other kids and adults who are close to the child)

Has anyone else experienced a child so young hurting them self and/or doing it and blaming others (especially an adult) for this? If so how has your child been doing, what options were available for support? How can we help them stop these behaviors?

This is not the purpose of this post and it is not something I wish to validate/explain/discuss as far as reasons why I work there. I  only mention it because I feel that it might be an important detail with regards to safety. And along those lines, in the last several years, human trafficking has become a silent and terrifying issue in our area. I have many friends that are social workers and city officials who have shared this information with me. Why it is not made more public is baffling.

Also, the school and the police have been notified and reports have been made.

Because of Corona, I ended up with a longer maternity leave than expected. That was wonderful and I'm so glad I got so much time to spend with my daughter without needing to worry about work. 

However, I have been working again, from home, for the past couple months. Originally, our plan was to figure out some kind of childcare for once I started working. My husband started a new job recently and our income has taken a major hit. Upon making a new budget, we have come to realize that we cannot afford childcare and I need to continue working so we can make ends meet.

While I work, my daughter wants me to play and interact with her, as any child would. She doesn't understand that I need to take time to work and won't be able to understand that any time soon. 

I feel like I'm being a bad mom because I'm not giving her as much attention and interaction throughout the day. She has recently discovered screeching as her preferred way to communicate and I find myself getting so frustrated. Sometimes I'll try all kinds of things and she screeches no matter what. Or she wants to play or practice walking (she still holds our hands to walk) or something along those lines.  

I don't know how to balance giving her needed attention as well as completing the work I need to do every day. When she starts to get upset I get so overwhelmed. I don't know what to prioritize and feel like I'm failing as a mom and at work. It's not unusual for me to end up crying as I reach my limit. Only to calm down and end up crying again later when I reach my limit even faster this time. 

If you're still here with me, thanks for reading this far. I know lots of parents have had to navigate working from home while parenting recently and I'm hoping someone might have a suggestion of how I can manage to do both.

I am really hoping to get some advice here as I am at a complete loss. I have a 4yo daughter that has been day potty trained since before she was two. A few months ago I started taking her to the toilet at night to get her night trained. I used to take her at around 11pm - 12am at night and around 4am(this one not always). She has remained dry almost every night to the point where I only started taking her once at night and she would even wake me up herself sometimes. I stopped night diapers around 2-3 months ago. 

Recently however she suddenly started peeing the bed almost every single night regardless of when i take her. So for example the other night I took her 3 times and her dad 2 times (we didn't know the other was taking her and were both sort of in panic) and she still ended up wetting the bed at 7 in the morning.  After this night, I put her back on diapers and stuck to the two times a night routine. However, whenever I go take her to the toilet I find that she has already peed in her diaper anyways. I dunno what the right thing to do here because she was doing really well but now she literally pees 4-6 times a night which I find unusual for her. I am thinking of just taking a whole break on the night training but I'm worried something may in fact be wrong with her.

I confronted him about it crying he said that he would never hurt me and he would never  do that to me againÔøºÔøºÔøº.. 
time went on things were goodÔøº, we had our little baby girl and then the doubts started rolling in againÔøº. Sure enough one night our-month-old baby in my arms we were sitting on the couch watching a movie I was exhausted and I saw that he was on his phone which I thought was weird I asked him what he was doing even though I got a glimpse of him on Snapchat, he said so naturally‚Äù I was just texting my mom‚Äù, I said OK let me see and I grabbed his phone he tried grabbing it back from me and then the Snapchat notification from a girl pop down. He cheated again. This time with a coworker he said it was only a bikini picture and then went through his phone saw that he had gotten nudes from another girl a few months prior. He said he was sorry &amp; was crying &amp; that ‚Äúhe‚Äôll change‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt really realize what he‚Äôd loose .. BS..  I was upset but I stupidly forgave himÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº. Couple days later I was going through his phone and I found a nude photo of his coworker Ôøºso he lied and it wasn‚Äôt just bikini pics. 
I forgave him you guys I know I‚Äôm SO STUPID. 
He still works with this girl to this day he is a nurse so he is around a bunch of girls all the time. This was six months ago. I can tell he has made changes since then, I have access to his phone we went to counseling etc. but when I try to bring up my insecurities or my feelings about our relationship or even just small issues like every relationship has he makes me feel like they‚Äôre not important ‚Äîjust more issues in our relationship, other than cheating. For example the other night I was crying because I had been bottling up my emotions for so long and he started yelling at me telling me to stop and how annoyed he was that I was even crying.. i‚Äôm really starting to realize how bad the situation really is and how he has been gaslighting me a manipulating me this entire timeÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº. It‚Äôs just so hard because he is a really good guy other than all the mistakes he‚Äôs made we have really really good times. But at this point it‚Äôs like my daughters are watching me go through all this I need to be a better example for them.. Hes also called me controlling for not letting him go get drinks with a girl friend (coworker) after work.. maybe I am but he just cheated on me with a freaking co worker 6 months ago?? So noüòÖ

Anyway what I‚Äôm really asking for is words of encouragement or advice.. maybe someone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation and how you built up the courage to leave. 

Btw he supports our family I am not in a good financial spot I am a stay at home mom and I would have to move back to Arizona ( I‚Äôm in Kansas now) with my parents and live in their guest bedroom with my two girls so it‚Äôs really not ideal but I think that‚Äôs maybe what is best.

With school back in session he's back with our resource teachers to help improve his reading skills which I'm positive with their help he will bounce back. 
Tonight I had him reading from reader books from school and he would read a line and complain that he was tired or it's boring. If he found a word that was difficult he would act like a wounded animal and the whole thing just becomes a mess. 

I as a child never was into reading. I preferred to be up in a tree or playing in a creek than sit and read a book. Now if the book really peaked my interest I could finish it in no time at all. And I have a sneaking suspicion that my son is like me in this area. 
 I resented my parents and teachers who made it seem like if you didn't like reading all the time there was something wrong.

I am 20 years old, my son is 14 months today. (yay!!) I have struggled with major depressive disorder for about 6 years. The postpartum depression was even more miserable. I have been fortunate enough to have a mother that lets me shack up with her as I go through college, etc. I share quite a big room with my son and I wouldn't have it any other way honestly. He is a TOTAL snuggle-bug. He is quick to jump from my arms into someone else's arms, but he is less than happy (so it seems) to come back to me. He expresses this by clinging on to their hair or shirt. I can't help but feel like he loves me less? I know what you're thinking: ""That can't possible be the case because you're his mother. You're where the food comes from."" Well, trust me, I know. I also struggled to breastfeed him. Probably because I can barely take care of myself. I'm pretty sure I only eat a single almost-square-meal a day with close to zero liquid of any sort. I just can't muster up the ability to carry out basic activities, especially since COVID-19. I feel like I can barely put out the bare minimum for him. Meaning he eats mostly frozen foods or meals, but I also do my best to give him yogurt, raisins, or other little snacks throughout the day. I make sure he drinks plenty of whole milk. But this is all I feel like I can do. Although it IS food, which is more than a lot of children, I don't feel like I'm doing my best for him and its affecting our relationship. I often find myself frustrated, mad, or borderline ready to have a mental breakdown. I feel unworthy of being a mom. I wonder how in the world I ended up with such a happy kid. He doesn't know how much I love him or how grateful I am for him. One day he'll know he quite literally saved me from myself. I unintentionally yell at him and I feel like such an awful person when I do. If I do though, I always do my best to apologize and give him lots of love. But the issue is I'm just ""doing my best"" and I don't think its enough. I feel like I don't deserve him. When he doesn't show me reciprocated affection I can't help but feel like its my fault. 


Anyways, sorry for the rant. I would really appreciate any advice I can grab. For myself as a mother or even to help parent.

Part of my conversation with my daughter last night (you can see my previews post for context) was that her sister becomes so angry so easily and constantly, and one resentment she have with my 15 years old is that sometimes ""she doesn't want to be with her"".

My oldest one likes to be heard when she ask for attention (but she could ignore you when you wants her attention). So my teenager said that her online school, homework, projects (plus her love for music) absorb her days, her thoughts, so sometimes she just doesn't wants anyone around, she also said ""you know that even I don't want you around either"" (keep in mind that we are close), it was funny so I just say OF COURSE I KNOW!.

Well, if you followed my previews post, last night was good but today she is stressed, her mind is in ""her problems"" which is fine.

I was armed with my face mask, hand sanitizer and my Infantino baby carrier. As I was unloading her from the car I saw someone I know from church. We haven't been to church in a couple of months because either it was cancelled or we didn't feel like it was safe to go just yet. She said ""Are you still getting the baby out?"" She said it like I was being an irresponsible parent for taking her out in public. I smiled and said, ""well this is the first time we've been out since May.""

I got a lot of weird looks and judgey stares as I walked through the toy aisle. My baby is 10.5 months and she's played with and gotten tired of every toy she has. I've made do with making homemade toys and activities, but she's still getting bored. 

What those people didn't know is that I've been fighting depression since she was born. PPD compounded by isolation and a lack of support system. What they don't know is that I've spent many days staring at the pile of dishes in the sink that only gets bigger and just cried because I just don't have the strength or energy to wash them. They don't know that I laid in bed and cried last night because my husband who has already worked a 50 hour week, got called in at midnight. So I was left alone with our teething, fussy baby again. They don't know that I sat with a screaming baby for 2 hours early this morning and held back tears because there was no relief for either of us. They don't know that I've only gone into a store 2 times in the past 4 months for fear of mine and my baby's safety.

I hadn't planned on going to Wal-Mart today. I've avoided it like the plague (pun completely intended). But today I couldn't bear to look at the dishes for one more minute. Or watch one more show on Netflix. I was like the Little Mermaid today and wanted to be where the people are. Even if I only spoke a few words to the cashier at checkout, I craved that adult human interaction. I wanted a taste of normalcy. I would have worn a full hazmat suit today if that meant that I got to go and do something like what I used to. 

With my baby snug against my chest and giving me weird looks because of my face mask, I got a taste of normal for the first time in months today. And no, it didn't make me feel all better. It didn't magically cure my depression. But as I left, I felt a little bit lighter. A little bit happier. A little bit more me. So before anyone makes judgey looks at the lady in Wal-Mart with her kids or baby, think about what she may be going through. Before you make a comment on why would she get her baby out in public, think about how long she has deprived herself of this very simple pleasure. Or better yet, mind your own damn business. We're all just trying to do the best we can right now.

Man, parenting is tough! I have an almost 19 month old son with a speech and language delay and developmental delays. We're going as fast as we can through the process to get him evaluated with our state's (we're in the US) early intervention program for speech, OT, and then follow up with a developmental pediatrician to find if autism and/or sensory processing disorder are what's causing this delay. I've suspected ASD and/or SPD since he was one due to him not meeting a lot of criteria on development checklists and the huge differences between him and my cousin's child of the same age, but was told by his past pediatrician it was way too early to look into anything and that he's ""perfect the way he is"".

The early intervention professionals have been so wonderful and we love our new pediatrician (we moved), but the developmental pediatrician that I did a phone questionnaire with and have talked to a couple times with questions has been so incredibly rude and disrespectful it was unbelievable. Both times I've talked with her, despite being very calm and kind, I've felt attacked. She went into our first phone conversation not wanting any introduction on my son, she had a really mean, cold tone. When she asked me questions and she didn't feel like my answers were clear enough she would repeat the question loudly in (again) a very mean voice. She complained to me about how parents think their child's behavior is typical when it isn't and are often in denial. She then told me she wouldn't see my son until I got the speech and OT evaluations done. So I went about getting those done but due to covid it's taking a long time to even get in with an appointment. I've been looking more into ASD and SPD and can definitely see many similarities with my son. I called her back after a week and left a message to tell her where I was in the process and see if there's any way to speed things up or anything else I should be doing. She called back and told me that the only reason she's having my son get a speech and OT evaluation before she meets with me (and him) is because she could tell from the first time we talked that if we did have a meeting I would argue with her the whole time (???) I have NO IDEA where she got this idea from. I'm pretty soft spoken, non-confrontational, and very polite. Literally I am so confused! I was speechless for a few seconds after she said this and she followed up with ""I even have it in my notes!"" She then raised her voice about how she can't stand it when parents make excuses for their children and try to tell her atypical behaviors are typical. I didn't even know what to say. There were a couple of times where I had to repeat a question I'd asked her because I was so shaken by her rudeness that I couldn't remember her answer and she would say in a very haughty voice ""LIKE I SAID... "" and then repeat her answer.  I told her that I'm very open to hear her expertise  and appreciate her taking these issues with my son seriously, but this is a whole new world for me with a lot of steps and I'm feeling a little lost and trying to find my footing. 

I felt like crying when I got off the phone. (I know, I know, I'm working on thickening my skin lol.) I thought about it for a day and decided to call my medical provider and try to get switched to a different developmental pediatrician for my son. I hate confrontation, but if this person is going to be that rude to me I really don't want her working with my son. My son's pediatrician is going to call me back to talk with me about my options. On one hand, I don't want to do anything that's going to set us back in this whole process, but on the other hand, I want to work with someone who sees me as part of the team and not some irritating obstacle that's getting in the way of her being able to efficiently do her job. She did mention that she has one thousand kids on her case load, which makes me think she's overworked and somewhat jaded, and I'm trying to be understanding of that, but man, that was an overall terrible experience that has brought so much extra stress to an already extremely stressful situation.  I would love to hear from other parents. Am I making the right decision here? As a first time parent, I am trying to find my voice and be more assertive.

I definitely thought my 7 year old daughter was spending too much time on screens, but reading the posts, that's how everybody was sounding, and what else could we do? Plus she's older so I figured it's natural for her to not want to play with toys, not want to go outside as much. Her big sister likes going on walks with me, drawing, reading books, and playing videogames - kids just have to find their own balance. But the 7 year old seemed to want to play games every waking hour. When she NEVER wanted to go outside anymore and cried about our family camping trip, I just figured she needed school to start so she could detox a little.

School started (in person, thank goodness) and she constantly whines about how she hates it. Her teacher said she doesn't even play with other kids on the playground, just walks around by herself and says ""I wish I was home playing minecraft."" Between roblox, animal crossing, that impostor game, I think I've screwed my kid up and fried her brain. Is ANY gaming okay for her? Do we need to treat this like AA and take away ALL of it for a few weeks? Set an evening cutoff time? What other activities can we do at home to distract her? I don't know what to do next. My husband likes screens way too much, he's admitting we have a problem but doesn't like my ideas of a 7pm family cutoff time or eating dinner around the table every night.

It's either like I'm talking to a wall, and she doesn't respond to what I say, or she'll purposely do the opposite of what I ask.

Often it'll escalate to her hitting/scratching me and pulling my hair. Earlier she kept screaming in the baby's ear. I forced her out of the room at that time for his safety, but usually I just try to stay calm and distract her through these episodes provided that she herself is physically safe.

She is driving me up the wall y'all. New developments are of course:

1. New baby, 7 weeks old. She usually LOVES him and wants to help take care of him, but I understand that a new baby can change the balance in the household

2. New neighbors with children we allow her to play with. Aged 3 and 7. These kids are often violent with each other and occasionally her. Just yesterday one came over, broke a toy in the yard, and ran off. They have sweet moments and they're also very young. I don't consider them to be inherently bad obviously, they're just kids, but I'm starting to get concerned that behavior is rubbing off. To be clear, when it escalates during play time and they start wrestling, I end the play time and take my kid home.

Typically being authoritarian does not work with my child. It'll escalate the situation. Ex: ""do NOT do that!"" Kid will do the thing harder. Distraction, if I can manage it, is best. Yesterday she would not get in the car. I told her I was getting angry, and I had to do an angry dance. She joined me in a dance of punching and kicking the air, then we laughed, and she got in the car.

I got a call from my 14yo daughter‚Äôs school wellness counselor yesterday while I was at work. She is suicidal, and I had no idea. She had asked to start seeing a therapist again because she was having anxiety and we‚Äôd been working on getting the appointments, but there were a lot of delays and her first solo appointment was just rescheduled to a later date that morning. She was meeting with the school counselor and an intern in the meantime. The head counselor called me while her meeting with the intern was happening, and they kept my daughter on the Zoom call to make sure she was safe until I could get to her. I dropped what I was doing and we went straight to the emergency room. They put her on a 5150 hold. Both the counselor and the psychiatrist she saw at the ER said it seemed primarily due to emotional abuse at the hands of her father. I know what he‚Äôs like, but the judge wasn‚Äôt convinced at our hearing and he still gets to see her most weekends and holidays and has equal legal custody. I‚Äôm so, so grateful that she had someone to talk to so we could get her help, because I DIDN‚ÄôT SEE IT. Even after I knew, I came home to get her to take her to the hospital and she seemed like her normal self. We were in the ER for almost 12 hours waiting for a transport to a pediatric facility and she seemed like her normal self. She has been feeling this way for over a year, and she has seemed like her normal self. I am terrified.

My boyfriend and I waited for 5-6 years to try for a baby. We had issues conceiving. We didn‚Äôt really tell our family, just because some of them are Debbie downers. My family have many boys in which I know from experience how to raise a baby. Of course this is sooooo different just because our baby is bigger than average in my family and I can‚Äôt take him back lol my baby is 4 months, he‚Äôs about 16-17 pounds, 26-27 inches. So you know how small babies were in my family. He‚Äôs learning so quickly, and I‚Äôm okay with that.  He has a firm grip to hold sippy cup, he‚Äôs learning to roll over and sit down a little. He wears 6-9 month clothes and uses small gestures for sign language especially milk when he‚Äôs hungry. Anyway that is my little back ground info. 

So yesterday I had my mil watch him because I worked. I wanted to give my niece a break from watching him and my bf mom always says she misses him. So I asked if she wanted to watch him for 3 hours. I don‚Äôt tell her his learning experiences because I figured it‚Äôs a precious moment for a grandma to see. Especially it‚Äôs her first grand baby. She only has two kids. Both men and my bf oldest doesn‚Äôt have kids. Of course we told her he‚Äôs growing and been learning quickly so we know. Anyway when I picked him up at 7pm she didn‚Äôt say nothing! By the time 9pm came around we literally about to sleep and she calls just to let my bf know baby is about to roll over and not let him sleep on the edge or else he would fall. I was a bit annoyed, she could of waited the next day or texted that. I mean we are his parents he sleeps in the same room with us in his crib. He sometimes sleeps with us in the middle. I would know if he rolls over.  I‚Äôm a very light sleeper so it‚Äôs not a big thing he doesn‚Äôt get wrapped no more. (I know some people don‚Äôt approve sleeping with baby, but we trained ourselves on safely sleeping. No rude comments about that) anyway I‚Äôm tired of our mothers or family telling us how we should raise our kid. They act like they never had babies before! When he cries and I let him cry a bit longer and they think he‚Äôs hungry or something is wrong with him. I don‚Äôt want to be communicating with them about not to butt in so much just because I repeat myself so many times. When we have them babysit a few hours so we can have time for ourselves they think we‚Äôre drinking and being stupid. I mean I‚Äôm 29 years old. I just don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs wrong to have a beer or two with food and a couple friends. Other time mil thought we were irresponsible for drinking a beer in front of him during a bbq with friends. We let her pick him up to spend time with her but yet she still managed to think we aren‚Äôt responsible. Our friends had his daughter who is a year old. I don‚Äôt know why she thinks stupid stuff like that. She out of all people would know we love that kid. On how long we waited to have him and we cherished every moment. I know she might be worried but I‚Äôve told her give us room to breathe. we decided to just get out of town for the weekend without family. We‚Äôre going to visit my bf brother and his wife.

Me and my daughter have always had a very close bond but lately it‚Äôs been rocky because of who she is seeing. My daughter is 16 and dating a 21 year old man. Just typing that grosses me out. 

About a month ago, she came to me to explain she was seeing him. She met him at a local job fair (that I now regret taking her to).

I recently moved in with my partner who has two wonderful kids, a 5 year old boy and a 1 year old girl. Both of them are very kindhearted, and I enjoy spending time with them. The 5 year old is incredibly picky, however, and refuses to eat anything. He picks the skin from sausages, the crust from sandwiches, won't eat any sauces or he starts gagging and crying if he even has to think about it. I have never parented before, and don't know if this is normal, but I know how important nutrition is especially during the formative years. So I want to know if anybody has some advice. He'll happily eat McDonald's or whatever, but I honestly just want him to eat a more diverse diet than nuggets and potatoes. I would make him some really nice food, but he won't even consider eating it. Period. If anybody has any experience with this, or any advice, I'd really appreciate it.

I wanted to get a few different opinions on a tricky situation I've found myself in.

My daughter has been attending a preschool at a childcare center and has started having troubles staying with the group and has even expressed a desire not to go to school. This started happening a couple months ago. Me and my wife thought it could have been because of a new teacher so she's just adjusting. Turns out there's another child in her class that's bullying her along with others and being extremely physical (hitting with fists and objects). We recently discovered video footage of that child pulling the chair out from my daughter and hitting her.

 Keep in mind these kids are 3-5.

Here's the kicker. Me and my wife are both employed at the preschool our daughter is enrolled in. I teach at a different level (5th grade), but my wife is the director of the program there. Shes already talked to mother about his behavior, and today was the last straw with his behavior. My wife asked for the mother to find another childcare center, which she didn't respond well to. She demanded to talk to the owner who then spent multiple hours with in a long discussion. The owner ended up siding with the mother to ""to try and make things work""

I feel like I can't help but be biased, but the teacher in me recognizes that the situation going on here is absolutely not ok for my daughter or any other child in the program. 

What can I do? I was thinking about group exclusion if he gets physical (like a in school suspension type thing).",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2842777,public,self,Preschool bullying,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/jbh4wn/preschool_bullying/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

My brother and sister in law are having a baptism party for my nephew 10 days before my due date with over 50 people in their small home (the venue cancelled their event since we live in a hot spot that is currently on the rise again). My mom and stepdad are our childcare while I‚Äôm in labor and giving birth. They are the only people who have had our two children overnight before and the only people not only I would be comfortable with watching them but who my kids would be comfortable staying with. 

My brother guilt tripped my mom tonight when she mentioned quarantining for two weeks before my due date saying she couldn‚Äôt miss the baptism party. My mom felt bad and said she couldn‚Äôt miss it. Meanwhile I‚Äôm sitting there panicking thinking who will watch my kids??

A little background, I‚Äôve had three miscarriages and my daughter had a complication at birth that could have gone south very quickly (so would not consider home birth). Two of my miscarriages were last year, one was our second daughter and they all were very traumatic but losing her was especially so since we thought we were ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù

Also last year my husband and son were diagnosed with a genetic heart condition that can be made worse by a bad virus. My daughter carries the gene but has not developed it yet. 

Needless to say we had a very small risk of each thing we went through last year happening and they all still happened. I couldn‚Äôt control any of that. Protecting my high risk family from this virus I can at least try, and would hope my family would want to try also. 

I‚Äôm. Really. Mad. I don‚Äôt even know who I‚Äôm mad at, if I have a right to be, if I should speak up...

I‚Äôm mad at my brother and SIL for having this party (they also had a gender reveal party a couple months ago that messed up my childcare for a really important test I‚Äôve been studying for two years to take), they‚Äôre having this baptism, then a few weeks later a birthday party for the same child the christening is for (so why not combine them?). I‚Äôm mad at my mom and stepdad for going. But at the same time I can not control what anyone else does! This is my birth and my responsibility to figure out right? Is it fair for me to ask my parents not to attend the party (and just go to the church as that is max 10 people)? Everyone seems to be approaching handling this pandemic differently and I‚Äôm trying hard not to judge but I‚Äôm terrified to expose my family to this when I could very well give birth before my parents quarantine period after this party is up. 

Options we‚Äôre kicking around is me just going to give birth by myself....aaanndd that‚Äôs it. There is NO other option for childcare. Literally none I‚Äôve run through the list.

How to deal with temper tantrums and disrespectful behaviour of a 4yr old girl who likes to push people's buttons to get her way.***

***I'd like to know what parents are other caretakers think, please.***

I nanny a 4yr old and 7 yr old.

It's not uncommon for the 4yr old girl to throw a temper tantrum. She does it less now, but it still happens. (Before going on, I want to say, she is switched on, smart, solution-oriented, creative, independent, and a strong personality who likes to put her stamp on things and do things her way)

When I come around in the mornings, I can barely say good morning to her without her being rude. She'll push me away physically and turn her face away if I ask her what she wants for breakfast. After 20-30 mins, she opens up and is really responsive and we can have a good time - reading and colouring together.  I take her to daycare, we talk or play a game in the car, she holds my hand, and I go in with her until I feel like she's feeling good to play, at which point she lets go of my hand. We spoke about this, she says she's still waking up and I understood this all along, though the behaviour isn't respectful. I have to add, I feel like her mother does try to mitigate this, though I think the 4 year old is 'playing her' in a way - I've felt at times that she may be crying or having a fit for attention, and her mother will be very warm and loving towards her, which is nice, but it's as though the 4 yr old is controlling the situation. e.g. she may cry and say 'I can't do this, do it for me', and until she gets her way, she'll cry. However, when I've stood my ground and haven't given in, she's done it very easily.

Regardless, I'm looking for advice regarding the temper tantrums. Yesterday, she was in a mood. She put her feet on the back of my chair in my car, and pushed in. I knelt down to her and spoke gently, and she began kicking me and turning her face away. This escalates. She became physical with her brother, and was calling me 'stupid' 'dumb'. (I'm only mentioning this to show a pattern of behaviour) Asking her to stop means she does it more.

I gave her 2 options which were, stop misbehaving and no time out when we get home. Or, keep misbehaving and time out when we get home. She kept going.

I was really not having it this day. I put her in time out. She kept opening the door and running out - and she would come to me and say 'Look, I'm out, can you see me'.  She'll also say things like 'Let me out, this is my house and you'll do what I say!' So I stood in front of the door. She would then say 'I'm going to jump on the bed' because she seems to think I'm going to let her out of time out if she does that. This goes on and on. I didn't give in, and of course, let her out after 5-7 mins. I was really stern with her for the rest of the afternoon. I told her she needs to look at me when she speaks to me. If she wasn't looking, I stopped her and said 'Look at me when you're speaking to me please' and did this multiple times until she would look at me. I didn't give her a choice with activities as I usually do and told her you're sitting at the table and doing your activity book. I didn't let her have her way or give her a choice in anything that afternoon.

Also, at the very end, when her mum came home and I had told the mother what kind of an afternoon we had, after not being nice all afternoon right until the end, she hugged and kissed me as I was leaving. This is only the 2nd time she's done this. The first was when we actually had a great afternoon playing with balloons right before her brother's birthday. She did this in front of her mum. Her mother thought it was really sweet of her. I thought she was doing it to say 'Look mum, I'm nice to her' so she doesn't get reprimanded for her behaviour. 

I want to know what your thoughts are. Is this too harsh? How would you handle it? Do you think I handled it incorrectly? Is this alarming? Am I overstepping boundaries?

But at this point things seem to be going backwards. While we are able to get him to focus and get his work done and what not we still run into a lot of situations where he just simply cannot stay on point with one thing for very long, he cannot sit still at any time of the day and his emotions seem to be a little more erratic.

At the moment, I don‚Äôt want them to touch me, I get beyond irritated at pet hair being around the house and feel like I could explode when they do things that I normally wouldn‚Äôt have that kind of reaction to (barking when someone walks past our gate, bringing dirt inside when they come in, being rambunctious in the house, waking me up at night, the rare occasion there‚Äôs an accident in the house). It‚Äôs like a disgust/extreme irritability feeling and it‚Äôs awful. I am not actively mean to them, I still am doing the feeding and might go out and throw the ball around and that from time to time, but I have yelled at them a few times and they are outside more during the day and I am not patting them or giving them much love to be honest. When I don‚Äôt feel averse to them, I feel indifferent and don‚Äôt really want them in my space. My husband still is loving them up and my son plays with them so they aren‚Äôt being neglected.

Super excited for the big day, will be on fianc√©'s family's farm. 5 months ago we moved up here a 6 hr drive from my home town. When we got over here fianc√© was going through a settlement with his ex, who tried to have him jailed due to an AVO breach when we didn't even notice her in a shop.

Then recently his pop had died and we get the house left to us, so will be moving in just after the wedding. In amongst all this theres been alot of organising for both of our sons (my kids from a previous relationship) to have disability funding, organising speech, OT and paediatrician.. 

this week we found youngest is autistic type 2 and has traits of ADHD and eldest is still yet to have his pead appointment, but because he was there at the appointment with youngest the pead did a quick assessment on him and said he'll definantly be diagnosed with a type of autism and likely some kind of ADD. We're about to make appointments for official diagnoses with a psychologist. 

Also in this same week eldest's preschool teacher let me know that he'll need to do another year of preschoo, instead of starting school next year. Which I already knew would happen before he started this year.

Their dad, who has 3 family members aswell as himself with autism aswell as dyslexic and ADHD (and mind you has nothing to do with them, and signed all the paper work to have the kids surnames changed into my fianc√©'s name on an agreement I wouldn't make him pay child support ever again. Which is jack all he never holds a decent paying job) even when I was pregnant with our first I asked a midwife when we'd be able to autism testing.

On the way home from the pead appointment I wasn't upset, I was glad to know the kids are finally going to be sorted out.. I don't see them any differently, if they didn't have these quirks about them they wouldn't be the beautiful, funny boys that they are. Anytime someone talks about them they're either cracking up or saying how beautiful they are. 

I guess this post is a self appreciation post of all the mind boggling stuff ive dealt with in the last few weeks.

I have worked in childcare for 6 years and I have worked for a lot of bad daycares that i would never bring my child to. I thought i finally found a place i could be happy working for and bringing my son to. I was wrong. 

This was our 5th week there. The first 3 weeks he was in toddler 1A. I was very happy with my son's teachers and he was clearly adjusting well. He was coming home happy, making art, and learning new words. I was getting detailed updates about his day. I was a floater teacher so I worked in all the rooms. Then one the teachers left and I filled the position. My son was moved over to the other toddler room, 1B. 

I was working in the room right next door as they were both 1 year old rooms. Both rooms have the same schedule so I could see my son's class when I was outside and I would peek in on him anytime I got a break. I saw my son fall on the concrete and start crying and neither of his teachers even looked his way. I saw a little girl fall, hit her face and start crying so hard she was gasping for air. One teacher turned around and said ""if you would leave your shoe on, you wouldn't fall"". To a 1. Year. Old. Baby. 

I also watched them use 1 sunscreen on the kids even though every child brings their own sunscreen. Some days I could tell my son didn't even have sunscreen. I had been told by both the teachers and other staff members that they dont like holding the kids and that they won't hold them when they cry because they're just doing it for attention. That's how 1 year olds let you know they need some love. How they could they not understand that?? 

I also heard from the teacher who quit that she saw them take food from kids who were eating slow and distribute it to other kids at lunch. I had a meeting with my bosses last week and was assured this would be resolved. 

Things only got worse this week. My son hasn't been himself. He no longer came home happy. He was a nonstop tantrum of screaming and crying. He was having a panic attack just about when we had to leave for daycare. I could tell he was feeling really upset and insecure in this new classroom. 

Today I confronted his teachers and one of them said that ""I'm not going to change how I do things just because you're uncomfortable "" 
I had another meeting with my bosses and both teachers. The teachers denied everything and my bosses blamed me. They didn't believe me. The only solution they had was to change the schedule around so that I wouldn't be able to see what's going on in the classroom. 

I told them I quit and went to grab my son. I said ""this is bullshit"" and got one of my bosses in my face saying Its not ok to swear and I was going to be escorted out. I retorted with ""so it's ok that they let kids get hurt but god forbid I swear."" 

I cried the whole way home. I am so angry. I am so anxious about the fact that my son was in there for a week and a half. I am very distraught and needed to vent.

He‚Äôs an awesome kid, really well behaved while admittedly turning into a lazyhead. I‚Äôm working on that. Anyways, he and his buddy have been playing fortnite together for over a year and oh man; they‚Äôre good. Like, really good. At 7. I jumped in a few games with them and it was ridiculous, within a couple of games they carried me to a victory royale. Anyways, his friend is a bit of a bastard sometimes but all kids are. I just happen to catch the friend quite often and rarely ever my son... my kid is smart though, so it‚Äôs totally possible he just doesn‚Äôt get caught. 

Anyways, I get a message the other day from my son‚Äôs mother telling me that she just watched in real time as his friend sent him over some hentai. Weird choice but cool. Then the friend went on to say something about girls sucking boys penis‚Äôs. So I message the kids mom and let her know, things are good. I have a co veraation with my son saying that they aren‚Äôt old enough to be sending those kind of pictures, and asked why he sent it.  He told me he doesn‚Äôt know and that his friend just sends them sometimes. I know I‚Äôm probably not getting the whole truth but he swears he hasn‚Äôt sent anything like that, so alright. I‚Äôll take it. 

Got another message today saying that his mother has discovered his YouTube search history on his switch. Randomly today he looked up the word ‚Äúporn‚Äù and the first result was some brother banging his stepsister. That‚Äôs it that‚Äôs all, no other searches and none of the videos were watched. So I feel like he probably just got curious. His mother said she told him she was disappointed in him but didn‚Äôt get angry with him. 

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I don‚Äôt understand how he could be curious this early, but I didn‚Äôt have the internet at 7 either. I don‚Äôt want to get mad at him, but I definitely need to set some boundaries. He already knows if his friend sends anything else like that, they can‚Äôt play together online anymore. 

I feel like the best thing I can do is just try and let him ask me literally anything he wants about it. I‚Äôve always tried to reinforce that to him anyway, but the topic of sex has me entirely blindsided here to be honest. I don‚Äôt want him to think it‚Äôs wrong or I‚Äôm angry with him, I like the idea of normalizing things instead of strict avoidance.

I'm a Mom of two girls (One nearly 4 years and one 2 months). 

When I had my first daughter, I had a very traumatic birth. When she was born I felt no connection to her. It was as if they laid a stranger's baby on me and said ""Here, she's yours"". I developed PPD, I got easily frustrated, but I trucked through it. By the time she was a year old, my PPD had fully diminished. I adored her and finally had a bond. 

Well I just had my second child (whom I was terrified to deliver because of my first experience) and it has been the *complete* opposite. My labor and birth was quick, easy, calm, and I was in great hands the entire time. When they laid her on me, I was so happy. I can cry over just how much I love her and I hold her and sit for hours doing nothing just soaking her up. We are completely bonded at just 2 months and she prefers me over my husband which makes taking a shower tricky but also makes me to happy knowing she loves me too. She receives 100% of my patience and love 24/7. 

So the problem: I have lost my bond with my first child. I am lacking in compassion, patience, and adoration for her. I feel like the worst mom ever and regularly cry over it because I feel such guilt. I'm always snapping at her and immediately feeling terrible that I'm not having quality time with her. 

I'm looking for any tips to help us through this rough patch. I found one article that suggested writing down all the good things your child did throughout the day before they go to bed and looking through their baby book. I make sure I read a book to her every night and when I have 5 mins where I'm not tending to chores or the baby I will stop to color a picture or do a preschool worksheet with her.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2841003,public,self,How to fall in love with your first child again?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/jb8lww/how_to_fall_in_love_with_your_first_child_again/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

Long story short, there was an explosive fight this morning which lead to him saying some very hurtful things to me. One of them being that everything about the way I parent is wrong. 

My husband was raised by his late mother. She passed when he was a teenager. The father was apparently an asshole and never in the picture much and they have a very strained relationship. I am going for more of a gentle parenting, whereas my husband is (in my opinion) just being a dick. I was raised by my mother and grandparents. My father wasn‚Äôt really in the picture but my mom did have multiple boyfriends. I want to raise my child to have confidence, which is something I completely lack. 

He doesn‚Äôt expect our child to cry when he doesn‚Äôt get his way, because he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt act like that when he doesn‚Äôt get his way‚Äù. I let him get upset and I validate his feelings. I understand why you‚Äôre upset, but let‚Äôs do this instead etc and this is why we can‚Äôt do this right now. He basically just told me that I am a shit parent and everything I do is wrong. We are both first time parents, so I‚Äôm not sure why he thinks it has to be his way or the highway and that he‚Äôs the expert here. 

I need advice and help from anyone else who has experienced this, when two parents just agree to disagree on parenting styles. I don‚Äôt want to give my son everything he wants all the time, and I don‚Äôt, but I allow him to have feelings about why I said we can‚Äôt do this or that. My husband basically tells him no and there‚Äôs no reason to act like that if he starts to get upset which I think is just ridiculous.

Maybe this will inspire some of you parents. 
 
I‚Äôll try to keep this short.

Believe me or not , I‚Äôve never seen my parents fight or be disrespectful to one another. Never in my life , even to this day. They didn‚Äôt hide it , it is just their way of communication. And since I was a child my parents did not belittle me as well. There were times I thought I wasn‚Äôt taught how to handle a conflict because of this , but now I am so thankful to realize they taught me how to handle conflicts WELL. 

Next up, my parents really appreciated me. I am an only child so yeah, I was the little princess at home. But they really made me believe in myself , not in an unhealthy way , they knew that if I just tried something I would be capable of mastering it. This gave me a very healthy self confidence.
So when puberty hit I got a real rebel. Staying away from home as long as I liked, drugs , the whole pallet. Thought I had the worst parents in the world , didn‚Äôt like talking to them, we had no relationship at all. But you know what ? My parents trusted me. They once told me ‚ÄúYou know, we can‚Äôt forbid you anything, you have to learn for yourself.‚Äù And when that‚Äôs not the biggest piece of trust a parent can give to its child , than I don‚Äôt know what is. Sure, we had all the talks, they sure were concerned and had sleepless nights, but never gave up on me , even when I shattered their ‚Äúhigh hope‚Äù future for me.I am so thankful to my parents for letting me grow into myself. Loving me even when there really was no visible reason to love me. There was a point I did realize , that I am the one responsible for my future. So because I developed a good resource in myself , I took action and am now creating the life I want to live , having parents that support and respect my decisions. This led me to the conclusion , I had the best parents I could‚Äôve ever asked for, not the opposite like I felt in my teenage years. It‚Äôs a nice , safe feeling to know I can count on them. 

Another thing that I am more than thankful for , is that I had the opportunity to adapt a healthy lifestyle from them. We only drank water and had no sweets at home , just occasionally. I was always kept an active kid so I still stay moving to this day! For real, you don‚Äôt learn a healthy living in school and the upbringing lifestyle health wise has a pretty big impact on a child IMO. 

These are the highlights. Surely not everything went perfect, but I am here to just share some points of my experience. I am really grateful and fortunate for the things my parents did for me. Now that I am getting older I am realizing all of this and can give it back to them. 
I really hope this sticks in some way with some of you , because I feel like these are precious qualities for good parenting.

She's very tall and sporty like build. 
Anyways in 1st grade she was really struggling with school and with the guidance of many doctors and teachers we decided to medicate her. It took a long time to find the perfect dosage and medication but once we did she shined!!! She went from a level 6 reading level to a level 20 in 3 months!! Her confidence improved and overall her quality of life is much better. Now, the usual doctor who sees her about this is different than our pediatrician but she's very careful and qualified. Every time we have upped her medication it's been closely monitored and everything. 
Now today after being on this medication and strength for nearly a year- I called to get a refill and a doctor (not even her usual one who sees her!) Decides hes not going to sign off on it because he believes the dose is too high and wants to knock her down a dose!!! I said I think that's really odd and unwarranted and they said well call you back. I tried to call in the meantime to talk to the doctor who usually prescribes it and she's out today and the front desk worker was incredibly rude to me about it- like I'm appauled. Then the nurse calls me back flat out refusing to fill her medication at the dosage she's been on for a year saying it's not right. I looked it up though on many places and the dosage is approved and actually not even the max dose for her age. I went ahead and gave her the lower dose I have for her in my cabnent from 7/2019 when she last had that dose!! However because of how this doctor is acting, now my daughter is going without her full med she's used too  because this guy decided out of nowhere he knows best.

It‚Äôs well known there are a lot of issues with drug use, alcoholism and domestic violence on the reserve nearby. My son is shy and just generally doesn‚Äôt do well with loud, pushy kids (based on our daycare experience). BUT I am reminded there are troubled families everywhere. 

The other choice is a French Immersion school about a 10 minute drive away. Better rated according to the Fraser Institute but we would need out of school care and of course driving him since we have no school buses here. Husband and I work full-time is demanding fields.

At the other school, I like that he would learn French but the thought of driving him and making his day so long really bugs me.

So my son turned one on 10/02 and we just got back from his 12 month doctor's appointment. His doctor happened to mention to me that his height was in the 50th percentile (30in) and his weight was in the 95th percentile (29lbs). She asked me to give her an outline of my sons typical diet for a day &amp; meal schedule and said it sounded fairly average and left it at that.

My son has always been a bigger boy. He was born 9lbs 7oz and 22in long (though I think he was more like 20in and they just measured him wrong at the hospital). He has followed his growth curve, always being above 90% in weight and roughly 50% in height, but this is the first time his doctor has mentioned that he may be too chunky. All the men on both sides of our family are tall, around 6ft, and my husband and I were a healthy weight as children. If anything, my husband was underweight. My son has a balanced diet, of course with treats occasionally. He is fully on whole milk with meals, has water throughout the day and 1-2 snacks (fruit, cheerios, crackers etc.) I should also note that he doesn't appear particularly chubby, but seems to be rather solid/dense if that makes sense? 

I guess my question is, has anyone else experienced this with their child? Is there something I should be doing? Obviously I'm not going to put him on a ""diet"" but should I be cutting down on portion sizes? (he's my first if you can't tell lol).

What do/should you do if your teen's friends parent crosses a line? Some examples:

1. Refusing to communicate with you at all. If they see you in public, they ignore you and only talk to your kid. 
2. Encouraging behavior you don't agree with
3. Having an unsafe or dirty home where your child could be (or has been) seriously injured.
4. Acting like a teen themself. Acting like ""one of the kids"" when you try to contact them on an issue that requires parents to step in. (eg, hey man, I'm the one who GAVE the kids that weed, don't be such a LOSER) 
5. Being bigoted (using racist terms, repeatedly dead naming your trans child, or similar) 
6. Maintaining abusive or unsafe relationships that affect your child (eg, my husband just got out of prison for sexually molesting 5 girls, he can drive the girls to soccer practice no problem) 
7. Failing to disclose information like #6
8. Bullying and general a-holian behavior 
9. Making false accusations about you 
10. Creepy behavior (the dad who comes into his daughter's room while she's in the bathroom and sits WAY too close to your daughter, this happened to me as a teen and I never went back but what if your child doesn't recognize the behavior or trusts a friend that it isn't weird?) 
11. General disrespect for your house rules and authority as your child's parent

I have been posting on her for the past month quite alot. I just don't know what to do anymore. My 13 month old is so fussy i can't handle it any longer. He had colics as a newborn untill 4 months. Then he was so extremely calm and an awesome sleeper all of the sudden, though still a nervous kid. And now, he goes to daycare since one month. He is super super happy there. 

They always tell me how quite and sweet he was.
And i just can't believe it because here he is a living nightmare. He's continuously whining, crying. Then he'll be quite for 15 minutes and he will start again. Now he also starts in the middle of the night, while he used to be an awesome sleeper.  I think i should also add that my son is not easy to sooth. Like, actually you can not sooth him at all. Always been like this as far as i can remember. He can't sit quite on my lap, he wants to sit on my lap and he will turn and twist and whine some more. Then i put him down and he wants to go up again, and keeps whining. I don't know anymore. He is very nervous, always been like this. It's so hard. Ufff i feel like losing my temper sometimes so i just put him in his play pen and go away for a few minutes. Is this the age though? Where they will be like this? 

At night, i usually don't go to him if he wakes up, because if i do that, it will never end. I rather let him be for 15 minutes  and usually he will fall asleep again. This night though...i decided, let me get him some water, i woke up for the toilet anyway, and he heard me and cried. Oh did i regret it...i've been up for two hours to ""sooth"" him, my husband and i fighting as well, a disaster. And then he woke up again super early in the morning with a poop diaper, crying from the moment he was awake untill now, he's napping finally. So this day was a true disaster.

This will be just a long poor excuse of a mom as I am but I am feeling more and more emotionally distant towards my kid as time passes by. But please hear me out. 

My baby is 9months old and I live in a country under harsh lockdown which started from March and is still ongoing until now. I am 23 and a fresh grad and it's my first time being a mom with no husband.

Its not so bad tbh. My parents pay for everything, but its eating me. The kid has been hospitalized before and I feel guilty having my parents shoulder everything. They work overseas and is elated to be grandparents, but I am not.

I am feeling inadequate day by day. it's been 6 six months. I've been trying to get a job, but I've heard nothing from any company I applied for. I want to study and prepare for the next job since I havent really studied, but I'm left to clean the house and with no one to take care of my baby. 

I used to be there for every cry of my kid, but my parents berated me that I should teach my kid to be independent early in life. And also so I can work in the house and get some free time on my own. My friends criticize me constantly that I do not care for the baby because I recently I just let her cry and I will one day inflict irreversible emotional damage on her. 

I know it's taboo because no one wants to admit that they didn't love their kid 24/7 and I'll be honest, I don't like my kid anymore. She cries everytime I leave her on her own in the crib, and sometimes I just cry because I feel so helpless. I want to be productive and I didnt imagine my life to be like this. I live in a dirty house cause I can't clean. I feel so stupid cause I can't study without someone crying over my shoulders. I feel like this is a mistake to have her. I wish I had a choice to not have her.

Im sorry if I offend any parents. I dont know why I feel this way. Probably because I'm still an immature person and not everything is going my way, but I need help.

We're looking for parents' guidance on our next project.

We think that most parents struggle with monitoring their children's safety online. Although many parents have a surface-level understanding that the internet *can* be dangerous. Most do not know how close their own children are to being exposed to content that, for example, can lead to online grooming.

Parents often choose the easy and sometimes effective route of blocking certain websites. But it's just not feasible due to number of websites out there and some websites are necessary for school work, especially with virtual schooling becoming a big thing.

My partner and I have made a simple web tool that lets parents enter inappropriate words/phrases which will be blurred out across every social media platform and website.

However we're unsure if parents would actually want to buy and use something like this.

Our son Skip (13 m/o) is not cuddly, and has not liked being held basically since birth. I can sneak in a kiss on the back of his head, but if he catches me doing it, he‚Äôll try to bite my face. He reaches his arms up to me as if requesting that I pick him up, but it is always to access something up high (like a shelf behind me), or to be transported past an obstacle (such as a closed baby gate). He does not hold onto me when I carry him‚Äîat all. I end up tucking him under one arm so that I can get a secure grip on him. He‚Äôs in the 97th percentile for height &amp; weight, so it‚Äôs like carrying a wiggling sack of potatoes. 

When he was a little baby, he didn‚Äôt seem to be calmed by being held‚Äîwhat he really liked was being forcefully bounced in a bouncy seat. Our rocking chair got very little use. :(

In fact, he has cuddled so little that I memorized the time and date of the one time he rested his head on my shoulder while awake‚ÄîJune 29, 2pm. I have photographic proof of it, too. 

That being said, he is affectionate on his own terms‚Äîa bit like a feral cat. If I lie on the ground while he is playing, he‚Äôll toddle over to me and maybe sit on me, step on my boobs, and slobber on my face. He is definitely emotionally attached to me, and has brief bouts of crying (separation anxiety) when I leave, which I interpret as developmentally appropriate. He smiles at me, makes good eye contact, and does that toddler thing of following me into the bathroom or tugging at my shirt-hem in the kitchen. He doesn‚Äôt yet have any spoken words but his receptive language skills are pretty good. I try to narrate things to him throughout the day, and I highlight emotional states‚Äî‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôre pretty frustrated that you aren‚Äôt allowed to pull the cat‚Äôs tail,‚Äù etc. He responds well to that and in the past few days, has gnashed his teeth at me (!!) instead of outright biting my face. 

He doesn‚Äôt have any eating issues; his growth trajectory is stable; no medical problems; he is meeting milestones. He is extremely active. Diaper changes are an extreme wrestling match‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt have the patience to stay still long enough. 

It kills me that he does not like much physical affection. Over and over again every single day, I reflexively reach to pick him up when he cries after bumping his head, or I go to give him a kiss after a diaper change‚Äîand he hates it. Or at best, he ignores me. The other day at the pediatrician, he got several shots at once, and was red-faced screaming. The nurse said, ‚ÄúOkay mama, you can pick him up now!‚Äù I paused, knowing that would make him angrier‚Äîbut also realizing that the medical staff would find it odd that I didn‚Äôt try to comfort him in the conventional way. In the past week or so, I‚Äôve decided to swallow my sadness and parent him from the position of what he needs (my presence, but no kisses or hugs, unless initiated by him), as opposed to what I want (a cuddle-fest on the couch). The latter just wasn‚Äôt happening anyway. 

So, can anyone empathize here? I‚Äôd like to believe that he‚Äôll eventually grow cuddly, but realistically it seems so ingrained that it is unlikely. My mama‚Äôs heart is heavy. It is so hard to do the physical labor of caring for a child and then have that child 

And beyond that‚Äîis there something I should say to the pediatrician? It feels odd and trivial to say, ‚ÄúMy kid hates being cuddled!‚Äù In my mind, it could either be just a quirk of personality, or it could be an autism-spectrum disorder, or a sensory-processing issue.

I have a 23 month old who is beyond ‚Äúbehind‚Äù. They have spoken a handful of words but use a word only once or twice before losing it. Recently they have been using one word several times. They do not do any imaginative play but will use some toys as intended (will do a puzzle or brush hair). All physical capability isn‚Äôt a concern. They never had separation anxiety and frequently won‚Äôt notice if I leave or enter the room. They will eventually respond to their name. Verbally comparable to a typical 9-12m old. 

Compared to a lot of kids their age, it just seems like they don‚Äôt want to do much. I‚Äôll put them in a sandbox and they sit there playing with the sand.

I was holding her, mind racing, calling for my wife.  I was terrified.  16 years of treating critical patients and being the calm voice of reason in chaos...and I'm damn near in tears, hands shaking.  I've seen this before and the last time was a helicopter evac to the children's hospital 3 hours away.

She asks again what she can do, and I told her to call the local ER (rural) and talk to the nurse on to see if I should bring her there or call an ambulance to take her the 40 minutes to the nearest city.

I'm at a loss for what to do and need advice or any help possible.

So I had my son in 2018 and everything was fine, I mean kind of. There were some things involving my son and his pediatrician(sp) that bothered me and still continue to bother me.

For starters: my son has a flat head( it's rounded out some but not nearly as much as his pedi claimed it would. I brought this up for almost a year straight and he continuously blew me off about it and still does. When my son started talking he was fine for a while and randomly after a couple months he just completely stopped talking. He won't say any of the words he used to know which were only 3 or 4 words at the time. He does bring certain toys to you to play with him, he knows the difference between his bubble guppies recordings on DVD and the on demand screen.  Tries to undress himself, grabs his shoes when he wants to go for a walk etc. I brought the speech regression up with his doctor and was once again blown off for the next couple appointments and told everything was fine. 

Well we had his 2 year wellness check and his doctor completely went off on me and my sons father..i mean had my husband in tears because he literally blamed us for everything. After that visit he gave us a month to get our son to say 50 words, to pit him in time out for literatlly everything and to only give him his juice or snack if he says the words. The only thing this did was curb his tantrums.
I'm honestly terrified of going back in two days because he hasn't made any progress.

So yesterday we had a telemedicine appointment for   a rash he developed from antibiotics given for q massive ear infection. I was killing time and looking at my sons medical records and from that one visit his doctor put he had oppositional defiance disorder and speech delay. He never said anything about the ODD and now I'm really worried I've completely let my child down and have no idea how to fix this and to be honest I honestly have no idea if I have the resources or am equipped to handle this.

Things I forgot to mention: 
- when my son regressed in speech we found out about 2weeks to a month later he had a ear infection, we got it treated but he kept getting them over and over again, it got to the point he would finish antibiotics and then a couple days later have another one. His doctor said he needed tubes in his ears which was fine but when this happened COVID started and no one was doing minor surgery so it took MONTHS to get a referral for a ENT and even longer for the surgery to happen. When he did get the surgery done his speech did not improve and still hasn't.

he's been to the doctor a couple times since the surgery and the last two times we were suspicious he had another ear infection, his ear was bleeding and we took him to the pediatrician and he blew us off again say his ear was only inflamed a little. We called his ENT same day and brought him in the next day to find out he had a massive ear infection and is on antibiotics and ear drops atm for it.

Any time I brought up early intervention or his speech his doctor blew me off until the September appointment then everything was out fault which is probably true. I really did try to get him to take us seriously but he didn't until last month and told us straight up if we didn't fix this out son would be on the short bus and no teacher would deal with him.

Sorry about the format, I'm on my phone and it sucks and also sorry for rambling. I might've forgot some things so please please please feel free to ask me and I will respond

Edit: his pedi has never had him do a hearing test or requested one. Neither has his ENT but he doesn't know the full extent of everything going on. Last one he had was a couple days after he was born. He's also never been evaluated by anyone and his pediatrician would not give me a referral to early intervention because he was ""fine"".

Sure thing. I remember being excited about video games.  We extended it to 10pm tonight.

So he comes into our bedroom at 9:10 in tears, literally.  Saying that the switch says won't finish the download for another 30 minutes.  And he's upset. Understandably so.

His mom said ""why don't you put the switch away, and we'll give you that extra hour tomorrow?"" And he didn't know how to respond.

So I just turn around and say ""you have two options.  Either put the switch away now and we'll give you that extra hour tomorrow, like your mom said.  Or you can watch the download bar complete and play as soon as it's available. But once 10pm hits you have to turn it off. No excuses.""

He said he didn't know what option to pick, so I told him that ""sometimes making no decision is the worst decision you can make.  You have 5 minutes into think on it and give us your answer""

He finally said ""I'll just wait until tomorrow!"" And stormed off to his room.

She very much has an only child attitude. Needs me to do everything for her. She demands things from me in a rude tone and cries about fucking everything, oh my God. She always needs to know 'who's to blame' when something happens, everything is a big deal, can't go to bed at night without her iPad, is scared of everything, has to always be walking in front of the group or she cries, etc. I've tried being hard on her, taking things away, not giving in, using a more stern tone, trying to reason with her, I'm at a loss.

I'm the parent of a three year old little boy. He came to us through foster care at 4 weeks old and was adopted (by us) about three months ago. All that to say, he's been with us for a very long time! 

Well, we are at a loss as to how to parent him. I know that's broad- but that is how I feel. He was diagnosed by a behavioral pediatrician at age two with ""global developmental delays"". The doctor said he was about a year behind at the time of diagnosis and that gap could widen or close as he grew older. As of now, he has very limited language. He probably has about 50 consistent words. He has a TON of energy and a very limited attention span. It is very difficult to get him engaged in an activity- either with us or independently. He spends most of his time wandering around and being physical. We are pretty chill about structure (maybe that's the problem?) so most of the time we just kinda explore with him. But, when he is agitated he will do things he shouldn't- grab things and throw, knock things off tables, pull things over- it's like chasing a wrecking ball! And, I'll be honest- it's really frustrating. But, it also feels super sad because he seems to not be enjoying himself either. But, if we try to play a game or be silly or play with a toy- he wants no part of it (or maybe can't have any part of it- I don't really know). This is all exacerbated by the fact that he can't express himself. The lack of language also manifest in him screaming A LOT. Not necessarily angry screaming- just super loud vocalizations that, after awhile, really put you on edge. 

Ok, so that was a lot more than I intended. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get him to stop doing things he shouldn't; I don't know how to redirect him; I don't know how to help him play; I don't know how I'm suppose to be teaching him good, positive ways of behaving. And, on top of all this, I feel like a total exposed nerve all the time, which is not helping. 

So, do you have any advice? Any things I should try? Books I should read? Mantras I should repeat over and over? I'm open to anything. We don't want to be a yell-y house or a punish-y house- but I'll be honest, I'm at the point where I feel like screaming and the only thing that sorta works is a ""naughty stool"" where he sits for like two minutes if he's being super destructive. The naughty stool feels super dump though because he doesn't know why he's there and he's not making the connection to the stool and his behavior so like, why are we even doing it? Also- maybe it's a terrible practice and we should be ashamed! I just don't know.

A little background, my wife is a public elementary school teacher who attended private school until 3rd grade and public school afterwards. I am a current college student nearing 30 years old with a good job who only attended public school.

The deadline to enroll in preschool in our state is the end of February so my wife and I have begun discussing our options. I recommended that we explore as many opportunities as possible even if that means we end up paying for private or home-based education. My wife immediately shut down the option of private or online education because she ""doesn't see the value in it."" I have been arguing that it can't hurt to look, but she flat out refuses. She doesn't want to pay for something that is already provided in public school.

My thoughts always return to how much I wish I had more opportunities in school. I was not the best, but I was a bright student who grew bored and ultimately struggled toward the end of my grade school education. I don't want this to happen to our son. It is also what led me to not attending college until my late 20s. I worry that a poor early education due to him being bright could lead to negative educational habits in the future as it did for me.

I've also read that smart kids who are understimulated are more likely to develop anxiety and depression and to develop vices on things like drinking, gambling, and drugs and I dont think I could live with myself if that happens and I know I could have done something about it. 

To my wife's credit, her private school was not a good one. She's always struggled with higher math because her school replaced math with sermon and confessional. She believes she would have been better off if she had never attended that school and I agree with her, but not all schools will be that way.

And I'm not saying we HAVE to go to private school, but I do want to look at what options are available so our son can have the best opportunity to succeed. 

So am I in the wrong? Am I putting too little stock in public schools? Am I not seeing what understanding her viewpoint as well as I think I am?

He can hold his own head up, can lift his head when on tummy time, and if I put him on a baby chair he stays upright (not 100% but enough to be able to eat for example).

She is in fourth grade and going to a school for kids who need help with reading/writing. She is actually a pretty smart kid. Not saying she does great in school but her problems there are mostly anxiety.

As far as autism goes, honestly, if she has anything I really do feel like its boarder line. There are a few things that really make me think it might be on the spectrum. Most the issues are she is 9 years old but has the attitude/playfulness more of a 5-6 year old. I know being locked up in the house due to covid  has hindered her social skills too. She is also extremely sensitive to noises. I would say those are the big two ""flags"" for me that she might have something going on.

After the appointment today I took my kid downstairs to scheduled the follow up appointment. My wife stayed and talked with the Dr. who was testing her. She didn't mention anything about the test but she did mention that she observed that our daughter is very bright. Ok no big surprise there. We never thought she was heavily effected by autism. Apparently the Dr. said that we should get an IQ test done on her because she might be in the 130-140 range. 

To be blunt I am at a loss. First I want to acknowledge that just because a Dr said she looks bright does not actually mean she is super smart. I have always said she is a smart girl but never really thought she was smart enough where she should get tested for it. So I have the following questions.

&amp;#x200B;

* Where do you get an IQ test? Is this something that can be covered by insurance? The only IQ tests I know of are the ones people brag about on /r/iamverysmart
* What does having an high IQ actually mean? I kind of feel like its one of those things that doesn't really matter considering we do not have the money to hire private tutors.

Obviously when we have our meeting on Tuesday I will be asking these questions to the actual Dr and getting answers that don't come from the internet. 

Again, I just don't know how to react. I am proud of her of course. I feel like this is big news but outside of feeling like its big, I don't know what to think. And even if she tests at below average, I would still be proud of her.

He is the youngest in his grade by 4 months (very small school), and since it is a split grade, half the class is more than a year older. All of the other kids have been at this school for 2+ years as a group, he's the only new kid.

He has been there for 6 weeks. He has had a rough time fitting in, and the fact that they are all masked didn't help (he had trouble telling the kids apart), and the other kids wouldn't play with him for a while. Frustration got the better of him a few times, and we got reports of him pushing peers, which we immediately addressed with him. We have had about 4 incidents over 7 weeks of school, most in the first week.

I've noticed that the communications from his teacher have a tendency to be exaggerated, for example ""He refused to do any work today"", but brings home a stack of completed work he did that day, or ""he pushed down every kid he played with at recess"", and he tells us he pushed down 1 kid, and was then put in time out for the rest of recess. Our kid is often confused by the teacher's statements.

Friday we received a note that he was extremely violent, attacked a kid who was lying on the ground and knocked the wind out of him, and they have put him on ""watch"". We were horrified, and talked to our kid about it. He was confused. He said he did kick a boy (in the groin - no idea where he learned that behaviour, since he has never done that before) after asking the boy 3 times to return a stolen item. The teacher talked to both of them, returned the stolen item and sent both boys back to play. Our kid thought it was no big deal because he ""didn't even get a time out"".

Obviously not saying that our kid is an angel, we need (and are) working on his frustration ending in lashing out, and directing him to ask a teacher for help instead of using his fists or feet, but there is a wide gulf between kicking a boy who took your belongings and kicking a lying down kid hard enough to knock the wind out of him.

Obviously I suspect the truth is somewhere between the two reports (the teacher's and our kid's), but he is feeling like his teacher is lying about him. As of now we have been in touch with his teacher to say we are working on his negative behaviours at home (and he's had a few great weeks), but should I be pointing out that his story wildly differs from hers?",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2835947,public,self,Teacher communicates in absolutes/exaggerations,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/jagwlj/teacher_communicates_in_absolutesexaggerations/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

We could also, worst comes to worst, hire a babysitter, but I would so much rather have my daughter in the hands of someone she is used to at this time.

My daughter's grandparents live 2 hours away from us in Charleston, where my current OB happens to be. I know they would be our absolute best option, especially if the labor goes on for several hours or days (as my last did). The other positive in this is that I really love my current OB and it would be wonderful to stick with her. I would like to be induced, so this could be a great option for us if I don't go into labor before my induction date.

I posted this earlier.  I cut out big sections and shortened it.  It's still long.

**Setting the stage round 1: Politics**

Quick breakdown, my wife and I are progressives.  Think... unwoke social democrats. 

My parents are die hard Fox News cult types.  MAGA hat wearing, pro-Confederate flag types.  

**Setting the stage round 2: Judgement ability**

As my parents have aged their judgements - together or solitary - are bad.   Examples:

1. 8 years ago my retired father dragged ass for 3-4 weeks gettting a kitchen sink unclogged, my mother got tired of it and poured a chem solution down the drain that mixed with a solution my father poured down earlier and it spewed back a gas that burned her lungs.  She STAYED IN THE HOUSE to clean up the mess where it blew back out of the sink.   The steroids she was given created an autimmune response that destroyed her joints, requiring 2 shoulder and 2 hip replacements.  It's in her knees too but she can't get replacements.   She's obese and depressed and heading for a wheelchair.  

2. They used to have a 150lb dog with an aggressive streak.   The whole family would argue with my father for them to get a fence so the dog could use the restroom - he hated fences and he dug in getting anal about ""my yard"" (the dog piss killed the grass).   So he got the fence and continued to walk the dog 2-3 times a day, but when he had to leave town for any reason, my handicapped mother was expected to walk said dog.  This resulted in a broken rib one time and a broken arm another time. 

3.  We were pressured to let our 18 month old ""play"" with the 150lb dog with an aggressive streak.   That...was an issue.  The dog was eventually put down for biting my grandmother.   This wouldn't have happened if they just put the dog away when people were over but my father always had to have him out to show him off.  he let strangers - kids sometimes-  come up to pet the dog, all the time, even thought hte dog had snapped at people before.

4.  My mother was back in a hospital bed b/c they went to the beach, and she - handicapped as she is - was using a beach cart (on wheels) as a walker.  The cart slipped out, she fell and couldn't walk for 2-3 months.

5. We came over often to bring meals, help clean, visit, etc..  She kept using the hospital bed in their home as a toy with my kid, and my father kept playing far too rough with him to the point someone was going to get hurt not to mention the noise was obnoxious.  We'd scold our kid and my father would contradict us right in front of us.   My mom would apologize and talk to him after it afterwards just for us to come back and him do it again.  One day we went over and we explicitly laid it down ""no playing on the bed, the wheelchair and walker are not toys, and no horseplaying"".   Well.. he ended up playing ont he medical bed, got a cable wrapped aronud his foot and popped his jaw on the corner of the foot of the bed.  He was crying (also hadn't napped that day) and we were checking teeth and jaws to make sure he's ok.   He was and things calmed down.  He then was in a kinda of ""i'm about to do a tumble"" position on the floor with his butt in the air and neck tucked under.  My father sees a butt in the air and playfully ""kicks"" him.   And if y ou could have seen the way his neck bent when my father did this, you would have hard cringed out of fear of the results.  He cried again, we made sure he was ok again.     When we left, my father told my mother and sister, behind our backs that we ""baby that kid too much"".


**Ok Now the Pandemic Stuff.**

My parents have been all in on this politically.   My mother has a helluva autoimmune disorder.  They're both obese. She's had severe lung damage.  They both have high BP.  They're both over 70.

If my mom gets COVID - she will be in ICU and there will be consequences.  There's no doubt about this.

Instead, they act like it's a mix of a ""chinese virus"" and a ""democrat hoax"".

I'll agree the media overblew the fatalities but it's still a fairly serious virus.  Even for those that don't die or get hospitalized - people are walking away from this with rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 Diabetes and other autoimmune responses.  No one knows the long term effects either.    But they act like immune teenagers.

They have complained endlessly about things being closed.  They talk endlessly about all the mom/pops closing but when things re-open they just go to chains. 

My father wouldn't use hand sanitizer until May or June.  And is still really bad about it.  He's always been bad about washing his hands and being clean and we ran into this problem before COVID.  We went to a petting farm/zoo once and he - within 15 minutes- went from scratching a cow's ass to rejecting my offer of hand sanitizer, to hand feeding my kid a donut when he was like 2.  he takes situations like this and you have to escalate to a full confrontation to make him do minor things, so most people, mosto f the time just let it slide b/c it's not worth it. 

Even today, my father gets around us - and we do evverything we can to be outside, to still get together but minimize effects.  My kid can have a water bottle, i can have a water bottle, but my father will insist my kid drink out of his water bottle b/c he thinks it's fun or something.

My sister, who lost her job, he constantly tries to take sips out of her drinks even though she doesn't have medical insurance.  When she pushes back, he gets all mad ""i don't have anything!"" 'I don't wnat my own- i just want a sip!"". 

he treats being asked to clean himself and have good practices as an insult to his character.

he took my mother to a doctor's appointment and had to go in to pee.  He then got into a 10 minute shouting match with a nurse (didn't help that she was black), b/c he was required to wear a mask in a medical facility (imagine that) just to pee.

My mother is constantly exaggerating what good he does and downplaying what bad he does b/c .. here comes the whole point of this post - **she knows it effects the time they get with their grandkid.** b/c she knows this creates a trust problem with us.   My mother is depressed and lonely - retirement and being disabled took a toll on her.  My kid is like this source of light in her politically obessed, overly negative life. 

Since COVID stuff all started, the monthly dinners out have been cancelled.  We've done birthday celebrations as cookouts.

We got our deck redone - put up a gazebo, got fans for the deck to keep a breeze going and keep bugs away.  **We spent like 8-9 grand on this**.   And they complain b/c it's ""too hot"" and ""your mother can't take the heat"".  Yeah - b/c she's fat as hell, never exercised in her life, eats like crap, and never exposes herself to elements that make her uncomfortable - be it heat, cold, activity that'd make her sweat, you name it.   But this is somehow my fault b/c i just won't move things inside. 

We're pretty accommodating.  I quit smoking 10 years ago.  My sister and father still do.  As much as we don't want it around my kid, our gazebo has ashtrays out on the table. 

I take my kid over to the grandparents house and have had arguments about coming inside.  I get the ""oh we're fine"" and i fire back ""youj don't know that"".  or ""i'm trying to be consistent with my kid"" and they still push back.  I don't give in.  We visit and grandma comes out to her drive-way bench and that's that.  they snip the whole time about it, i snip back about them constantly acting like this disease doesn't exist and they're immune. 

It's just been constant push push push.

When restaurants re-opened, they were first in line to go out to eat.  They go out 3-4 times a week.  They were first in line to go get their hair cut again.  My wife goes to a stylist where she's the only one in the facility at the time and everyone is masked and she lets it go 2x as long between visits than she used to.  My kid gets his hair cut in the drive way. I shave my own head. my parents go to cheap ass little places that are chock full of customers at once. 

They went to a family reunion - the average age there was 60.  It was indoors. people FLEW in from all over.  

They just keep acting like ""things need to get back to normal"". That if things just go back to normal the disease will just go away or something. 

My mother has even stooped to sending me memes about how government covid restrictions are signs of the devil (you know how people need to be six feet ahead, behind and besides us? 666.. get it? this is all satan's work!).

Here's where it ramps up into absolute insanity.  This is a 2 parter:

**Insanity:** 

Due to mobility problems my parents needed to move to a more suitable house.    about 10 years ago, I moved to a neighboring county, about 25 minutes away from them.   That distance was, in part, on purpose.  The other deciding factor was bang for your buck in terms of property size. But getting away from them was a big factor.

Before my kid, before my mother's depression and anger due to her disability,  and before Obama, i was able to tolerate them more.  But since .. some weeks  are just hard.  Really hard. And even harder for my wife.   I try not to be that person who puts politics over personal relationships.  That shit is so destructive.  but now it's intersecting in a hard hard way.... 

anyways, they bought a fucking house walking distance from my own.  **about 1.25 miles away.**   

My parents are also aware of all i've been through this year in this regard.

I just don't know what to do. They just keep pushing and pushing.

My mother tries manipulating the situation by getting my kid to beg us to let him spend the night in their new house.

She keeps pushing for us to come over during ""rainy days"" where we can't go to playgrounds or parks - even though she knows i'm keeping out of people's houses.

My father is just aggressive about how stupid, confining, and whatever all the lockdowns are and how everyone's cautions are ""living in fear"". they do this ""we're just talkin about people/kids/society/politics but we're really talking about you"" type of thing.   They do generalized rants to make personal criticisms.

My mother is more manipulative.  constantly trying to push the line a little more here and there.   They think this is all about politics and not about health.  I see 8 years of them making horrible decisions regarding health.  for examples - they smelled gas in the old house and took 2 months to get it checked out - turns out they had a leak the whole time.   Just.. constant bad decisions. Constant. With my kid, with their house, their dog, their health.  

They talk generally about "" what kids need"" all the time regarding socialization as a means of guilting me about the fact that my wife and I have kept my kid out of daycare.  (he starts school next year).  Nevermind, my kid stays busy.

I do education with him 5 days a week for 60-90 min a day.

He plays with 2 neighbour kids 2-3 times a week.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.

over the summer, we'd take long lunches to the neighborhood pool before anyone showed up.  3-5 days a week we'd swim 1-2 hours a day.

we have gone to the drive-in 6 times.  we go to parks and playgrounds 3-4x a week.  i've taught him to ride a bike this year, he's learned to swim without floaties this year, we rented a beach house and had a great vacation. 

we have movie night 2x a week and my kid has become a huge fan of Svengoolie nights.  We have ""music nights"" where we play mp3s or records while my kid plays on his instruments and sings.  We have  board game night.   He got a tablet this year and inherited my NES, Wii, Sega Genisis and learned to beat super paper mario and super wii mario which we play together more than alone.   We make smores around the fire pit we built over the early spring.  We're going to pick pumpkins with one of his friends and their family this weekend and do the whole corn field maze and all that jazz.  

We'll even do indoor stuff if there's next to no one there.  We've done laser tag, a trampoline park at 10am, putt putt (outdoors), arcade attached to the putt putt, bowling at 10am where lanes have walls between them and people are spaced out ever other lane.   We've done zoos (drive through and eventually walk through), lakes, canoeing, fishing, hiking.    

He's learned, a little, to skateboard.   He starts a soccer clinic today.  

I mean, we do shit.  We stay busy and i try to find a balance between having a life and avoiding the coronavirus.   From March until June, he had one of his laid off daycare teachers come over and care for him during the day while i had lots of work stuff scheduled that day each week.  I mean - he sees people, his days are structured, he gets education and exercise, he's entertained, he socializes - not as much as he used to  but we're doing ok. 

I just don't want to be in people's houses, i don't want to be in big crowds, i don't go out to eat (i'll eat outside if tables are spaced - which we've done twice).  i don't want my kid in daycare.

i want my kid to wear a mask, i want everyone around us to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer, people shouldn't drink after each other.  

i'm not asking a lot.  and i feel more comfortable being around people who don't have to be forced to wear a mask and clean their fucking hands and who have the sense to not drink after other people. 

but they push and push and push.  everytime you find a new way for them to get a dig in, or manipulate my kid, or push memes downplaying coronavirus (with the obvious conclusion being that we shouldn't worry about it at all).

they act like invincible teenagers.  the only deaths that matter are the ones that happened under Democrat mayors and governors.  The virus is only looked at politically and by no other measure and so me and my ""liberal"" wife are just ""cowering in fear"" sort of thing.  they basically say that without saying it directly.   

but thanksgiving is coming.  Christmas is coming.  they now live 1.25 miles away.

wtf do i do.  Both of these events will have my great grandmother.   My uncle - who's dying and will not make it anotehr year b/c he takes such poor care of himself - and he's really really unsanitary in the extreme and is in and out of hospitals weekly.  

but overall, i see it as us having another year of this shit.   my parents have already stated they won't be getting the vaccine.   They were against my kid's 4 year old doctor visit where he basically got 4 vaccines at once.   My father never gets the flu vaccine b/c he swears his father got the flu everytime he got the flu shot every year.   they are as anti-vaxx as you can get without stating they are antivaxx.  they hide from that label but it's what they are.

These are the type of assholes that, to this day, do not wear their seatbelts. They'll let the car beep at them for 5 minutes rather than put it on. They ranted on our behalf b/c it should be ""parental choice"" whether you kid has to be in a car seat.  My father is the type that smokes in non-smoking areas of hospitals and is always ran off by security and gets into conflicts with them about it.  

You have to drag them, kicking and screaming, to make the ""right"" choices on the smallest of things.. but i'm the coward.  I'm harming my kid by keeping him away from kids at daycare.   they manipulate my kid to make me and my wife out to be the bad guys when he gets him to ask to spend the night.

my mother will even say ""your mom will hate me for asking this"" or something to that effect - b/c she knows my wife will say no but she'll push my 4 year old with it anyways.

and now it's all ""why don't you just swing by"" b/c we're not even a whole song on the radio away fromt heir house.  So our avoidance of them can't be excused with the 25-30 minute trip to their house and back anymore. 

But man i don't want a confrontation.  I don't want to cut them off either, and that's an option b/c i think a confrontation is just a pause on bad behavior rather than a cessation of it. i just feel... frustrated.

I was having a really rough day. Like, really. A sort of depressive episode, period coming up, husband leaving for his job for 2 days, and bathing our son (2) who didn't want to be bathed. And when he was in the tub, he didn't want to get out.

I tried to keep my calm, while on the verge of tears, and began talking to him about the time before he excisted. Partly to remind myself what good he brings me, partly because talking about that leaves less room for angry words.

As I finally got him out of the tub, ready to dry, I said 'yes, there was a time before you, but I am happy you're here.'

He looked at me, hugged me and said 'you are my mommy, I chose you.'

After that, I was crying.

When I was younger my mom never even entertained the idea of me and my siblings missing church, I think she would‚Äôve slapped me for even asking to skip a service, but I don‚Äôt want to do the same with him.  Since he‚Äôs 6 my husband thinks I‚Äôm crazy for even entertaining  letting him miss church but I feel like if I force him now, he will never actually enjoy going. My husband also thinks that if I cave in, our son will think that all he has to do is throw temper tantrums to get out of doing things. The obvious answer would be to take turns with my husband staying home with him on Sundays but my husband and I enjoy worshipping together and seeing our friends at church, it‚Äôs honestly our favorite day of the week.

So from the beginning of my pregnancy I have been doing things naturaly and my husband has supported me through it all. We decided to have a free birth which I know is controversial but I did my research prepared and had a backup plan. My mom who is a control freak kept insisting I needed to tel her my birth plan. All I told her was I was doing it at home and I just wanted my husband there but she kept prodding and eventually I told her. She got very upset and decided she was going to hire a midwife to keep on standby Incase I needed help. I said yeah whatever do what you want so long as she was off my back. Fast forward I was at 41 weeks pregnant bouncing on my ball chatting to my husband and my water broke. We contacted all of the family and because my parents live close my mom kept nagging me about coming to sit with me for support I was a few hour in at that point having contractions and I wasnt realy thinking and just wanted peace so my mom called the midwife to wait at her house and she came to sit with me in our apartment the next morning I had been in labour probebly 9 or 10 hours by then my mom decided I was labouring to long and in too much pain and couldnt handle it so she insisted we call the midwife to come check me I didnt want checks I wanted to feel it out and I was feeling pretty in touch with my body at that point I felt good but my mom said no Id be more comfortable at her house cause its bigger and the midwife was there so I reluctantly went I handled the labour well at around 19 hours of labour I was really feeling like it was getting close I was dialating all was well but when I started to feel the urge to push the midwife kept insisting i restist it and force myself not to push otherwise the baby would come too fast she also told me to lie down and I really needed to sit up suddenly I went from 6 cm dialated to 4 the baby was going back inside and it was 24 hours labour so the midwife told me i had to go to the hospital now. I ended up in a public hospital labouring for four mor hours gave birth at around midnight and had to spend the next day in the hospital the problem was it was covid lockdown my husband wasnt aloud to even stay at the hospital and I forgot my phone in the hospital I had no way of contacting my husband to let him no I was ok all the nurses refused to let me call him I was alone and scared and when he called the hospital they refused to tell him what was going on the staff yelled at me the whole time including pulling the baby off my boob and walking away with my baby without a word about where they where going later found out they where giving her formula because my milk wasnt good enough according to them when wasnt even done feeding her and put her in an incubater and just left her there alone without telling me anything.
I know its three months later but Im getting very angry about the whole thing cause I let my mom take control in my weakness and I'm 95% convinced the only reason I ended up so tired they had to do an epesiotomy on me and the doctor literaly had to squeeze my baby out of me like a tube of toothpaste was because I wasnt pushing when my body told me too. I dont know why Im feeling so much anger about it right now because my mom has mellowed out recently. But I guess it got triggared when I went out with her yesterday and she told her friend she did the whole 28 hours with no drugs I didnt think she could do it she cant handle pain at all.

My wife and I are both fine with this, but it's clear this was something directed at their teacher as well. It was late last night, so we told them we'd have to have a more in-depth discussion tomorrow (not because it's anything bad, just because it's a big decision).

We're mostly just looking for feedback from other parents who've dealt with similar situations. In particular, if they decide to make the change official, any advice on brokering that change with their teachers and peers.

A few notes that may be relevant:

\- Our child is curious about sex and has already identified as bi-sexual and is somewhat invested in that identity, but they've never mentioned being trans or feelings of dysphoria. We've bought them a couple of kid-friendly books that discuss topics of sex, gender and sexual orientation  
\- We've had some indications that they might be starting puberty, this was maybe two weeks ago... last we knew they were excited to be trying out training bras  
\- They've often self-identified as a ""tomboy,"" though they don't necessarily fit the stereotype (no sports, mostly an indoor kid). They mostly are into video games (Roblox) and YouTube, but still very recently were into LOL dolls and such as well. Recently expressed an interest in wearing more boy-ish clothes, though  
\- They did have a therapist until fairly recently, did not respond well to online-only visits so we discontinued them. Behaviorally, they are quick to anger and struggle to communicate at times

With all that in mind, we're aware this could be ""just a phase"" but of course we want to handle it delicately and supportively. We'll always have their back, but one of my major concerns is how it'll go over with their peers. We live in a relatively progressive, but still very rural area in the northeast US. Our child is definitely shy and sensitive and their best friend moved to a different district last year, so they've been feeling isolated and lonely even more than usual for pandemic-times.

**Setting the stage round 1: Politics**

Quick breakdown, my wife and I are progressives.  We liked Bernie, I liked Tulsi.  We like people like Glen Greenwald and such.   We dont' like Biden.  We tend to think of ourselves as ..nuanced, moderate or maybe even contrary progressives.  We're not ""woke"".

My parents are die hard Fox News cult types.  MAGA hat wearing, pro-Confederate flag types.  

**Setting the stage round 2: Judgement ability**

As my parents have aged their judgements - together or solitary - are bad.   Examples:

1. 8 years ago my retired father dragged ass for 3-4 weeks gettting a kitchen sink unclogged, my mother got tired of it and poured a chem solution down the drain that mixed with a solution my father poured down earlier and it spewed back a gas that burned her lungs.  She STAYED IN THE HOUSE to clean up the mess where it blew back out of the sink.   The steroids she was given created an autimmune response that destroyed her joints, requiring 2 shoulder and 2 hip replacements.  It's in her knees too but she can't get replacements.   She's obese and depressed and heading for a wheelchair.  

2. They used to have a 150lb dog with an aggression streak.   The whole family would argue with my father for them to get a fence so the dog could use the restroom - he hated fences and he dug in getting anal about ""my yard"".  So he got the fence and continued to walk the dog 2-3 times a day, but when he had to leave town for any reason, my handicapped mother was expected to walk said dog.  This resulted in a broken rib one time and a broken arm another time. 

3.  We were pressured to let our 18 month old ""play"" with the 150lb dog with an aggression streak.   That...was an issue.  The dog was eventually put down for biting my grandmother.   This wouldn't have happened if they just put the dog away when people were over but my father always had to have him out to show him off.  he let strangers - kids sometimes-  come up to pet the dog, all the time, even thought hte dog had snapped atpeople before.

4.  My mother was back in a hospital bed b/c they went to the beach, and she - handicapped as she is - was using a beach cart (on wheels) as a walker.  The cart slipped out, she fell and couldn't walk for 2-3 months.

5. We came over often to bring meals, help clean, visit, etc..  She kept using the hospital bed in their home as a toy with my kid, and my father kept playing far too rough with him to the point someone was going to get hurt not to mention the noise was obnoxious.  We'd scold our kid and my father would contradict us right in front of us.   My mom would apologize and talk to him after it afterwards just for us to come back and him do it again.  One day we went over and we explicitly laid it down ""no playing on the bed, the wheelchair and walker are not toys, and no horseplaying"".   Well.. he ended up playing ont he medical bed, got a cable wrapped aronud his foot and popped his jaw on the corner of the foot of the bed.  He was crying (also hadn't napped that day) and we were checking teeth and jaws to make sure he's ok.   He was and things calmed down.  He then was in a kinda of ""i'm about to do a tumble"" position on the floor with his butt in the air and neck tucked under.  My father sees a butt in the air and playfully ""kicks"" him.   And if y ou could have seen the way his neck bent when my father did this, you would have hard cringed out of fear of the results.  He cried again, we made sure he was ok again.     When we left, my father told my mother and sister, behind our backs that we ""baby taht kid too much"".


**Ok Now the Pandemic Stuff.**

My parents have been all in on this politically.   My mother has a helluva autoimmune disorder.  They'ree both obese. She's had severe lung damage.  They both have high BP.  They're both over 70.

If my mom gets COVID - she will be in ICU and there will be consequences.  There's no doubt about this.

Instead, they act like it's a mix of a ""chinese virus"" and a ""democrat hoax"".

I'll agree the media overblew the fatalities but it's still a fairly serious virus.  Even for those that don't die or get hospitalized - people are walking away from this with rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 Diabetes and other autoimmune responses.  No one knows the long term effects either.    But they act like immune teenagers.

They have complained endlessly about things being closed.

My father wouldn't use hand sanitizer until May or June.  And is still really bad about it.  He's always been bad about washing his hands and being clean and we ran into this problem before COVID.  We went to a petting farm/zoo once and he - within 15 minutes- went from scratching a cow's ass to rejecting my offer of hand sanitizer, to hand feeding my kid a donut when he was like 2.

Even today, my father gets around us - and we do evverything we can to be outside, to still get together but minimize effects.  My kid can have a water bottle, i can have a water bottle, but my father will insist my kid drink out of his water bottle b/c he t hinks it's fun or something.

My sister, who lost her job, he constantly tries to take sips out of her drinks even though she doesn't have medical insurance.  When she pushes back, he gets all mad ""i don't have anything!""

he treats being asked to clean himself and have good practices as an insult to his character.

he took my mother to a doctor's appointment and had to go in to pee.  He then got into a 10 minunte shouting match with a nurse (didn't help that she was black), b/c he was required to wear a mask in a medical facility (imagine that) just to pee.

My mother is constantly exaggerating what good he does and downplaying what bad he does b/c .. here comes the whole point of this post - she knows it effects the time they get with their grandkid.

Since this all started, the monthly dinners out have been cancelled.  We've done birthday celebrations as cookouts.

We got our deck redone - put up a gazebo, got fans for the deck to keep a breeze going and keep bugs away.  We spent like 8-9 grand on this.   And they complain b/c it's ""too hot"" and ""your mother can't take the heat"".  Yeah - b/c she's fat as hell, never exercised in her life, eats like crap, and never exposes herself to elements that make her uncomfortable - be it heat, cold, activity that'd make her sweat, you name it.   

We're pretty accommodating.  I quit smoking 10 years ago.  My sister and father still do.  As much as we don't want it around my kid, our gazebo has ashtrays out on the table. 

I take my kid over to the grandparents house and have had arguments about coming inside.  I get the ""oh we're fine"" and i fire back ""youj don't know that"".  or ""i'm trying to be consistent with my kid"" and they still push back.  I don't give in.  We visit and grandma comes out to her drive-way bench and that's that.  

It's just been constant push push push.

When restaurants re-opened, they were first in line to go out to eat.  They go out 3-4 times a week.  They were first in line to go get their hair cut again.  My wife goes to a stylist where she's the only one in the facility at the time and everyone is masked and she lets it go 2x as long between visits than she used to.  My kid gets his hair cut in the drive way. I shave my own head. 

They went to a family reunion - the average age there was 60.  It was indoors. people FLEW in from all over.  

They just keep acting like ""things need to get back to normal"".

My mother has even stooped to sending me memes about how government covid restrictions are signs of the devil (you know how people need to be six feet ahead, behind and besides us? 666.. get it? this is all satan's work!).

Here's where it ramps up into absolute insanity.  This is a 2 parter:

**Insanity #1:** 

Due to mobility problems my parents needed to move.    about 10 years ago, I moved to a neighboring county, about 25 minutes away from them.   That distance was, in part, on purpose.  The other deciding factor was bang for your buck in terms of property size. But getting away from them was a big factor.

Before my kid and before Obama, i was able to tolerate them more.  But since .. some weeks is just hard.  Really hard.   I try not to be that person who puts politics over personal relationshnips.  That shit is so destructive.  but now it's intersecting in a hard hard way.... 

anyways, they bought a fucking house walking distance from my own.  about 1.25 miles away.   

**Insanity #2.  My health anxiety**

This goes into another equally long topic but the short of it is in 2017 i  got a back pain.   The back pain grew and expanded.  I developed a fear that it was something serious.  I had all kinds of tests, scans, PT, drugs, you name it and it didn't go away.   I tried losing weight with keto and did (60lbs and i got way too skinny and bony which causes even more pains).  Come to find out i had 2 hernias from weight lifting that required surgery and my back pains just took a whole lot of PT (still doing it andi t's much better).  Along the way that i developed a deep, intense health anxiety.   My anxiety gives me really scary symptoms. Numbness in my face, tingling in my hands, heart palpitations.   I went the drug route for a while and that made it worse and gave me insomnia that took 4-5 months to correct after quitting.  The keto diet, got me used to ruminating all day about food as it related to health, since the diet was so extreme and i had to ""rethink"" every meal i ate and made. It's like my brain got stuck in that mode. So everytime i got a new symptom, i'd be convinced i had somehting new and fatal wrong with me and i'd need to change my diet to lower my blood pressure or avoid fat or avoid carbs or avoid omega6s or whatever.  I kept doing these OCD behaviors that made my anxiety worse.   I basically spent the back half of 2019 and first half of 2020 thinking i was going to die from one thing or another, and lets just say every thing i did and everyone i interacted with brought me sadness, even my kid and even my cats.

needless to say - me and health subjects dont mix right now.

and i'd be lying if i didn't admit that watching my parents minds and bodies crumble before me hasn't been part of this health anxiety.

and if my parents, myself, my wife or kid got COVID... i'd backslide a whole lot with the gains i've made with all this anxiety stuff.

My parents are also aware of all i've been through this year in this regard.

I just don't know what to do. They just keep pushing and pushing.

My mother tries manipulating the situation by getting my kid to beg us to let him spend the night in their new house.

She keeps pushing for us to come over during ""rainy days"" where we can't go to playgrounds or parks - even though she knows i'm keeping out of people's houses.

My father is just aggressive about how stupid, confining, and whatever all the lockdowns are and how everyone's cautions are ""living in fear"".  My mother is more manipulative.  constantly trying to push the line a little more here and there.   They think this is alla bout politics and not about health.  I see 8 years of them making horrible decisions regarding health.  for exmaples - they smelled gas in the old house and took 2 months to get it checked out - turns out they had a leak the whole time.   Just.. constant bad decisions. Constant. With my kid, with their hosue, their dog, their health.  

They talk generally about "" what kids need"" all the time regarding socialization as a means of guilting me about the fact that my wife and I have kept my kid out of daycare.  (he starts school next year).  Nevermind, my kid stays busy.

I do education with him 5 days a week for 60-90 min a day.

He plays with 2 neighbour kids 2-3 times a week.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.

over the summer, we'd take long lunches to the neighborhood pool before anyone showed up.  3-5 days a week we'd swim 1-2 hours a day.

we have gone to the drive-in 6 times.  we go to parks and playgrounds 3-4x a week.  i've taught him to ride a bike this year, he's learned to swim without floaties this year, we rented a beach house and had a great vacation. 

we have movie night 2x a week and my kid has become a huge fan of Svengoolie nights.  We have ""music nights"" where we play mp3s or records while my kid plays on his instruments and sings.  We have  board game night.   He got a tablet this year and inherited my NES, Wii, Sega Genisis and learned to beat super paper mario and super wii mario which we play together more than alone.   We make smores around the fire pit we built over the early spring.  We're going to pick pumpkins with one of his friends and their family this weekend and do the whole corn field maze and all that jazz.  

We'll even do indoor stuff if there's next to no one there.  We've done laser tag, a trampoline park at 10am, putt putt (outdoors), arcade attached to the putt putt, bowling at 10am where lanes have walls between them and people are spaced out ever other lane.   We've done zoos (drive through and eventually walk through), lakes, canoeing, fishing, hiking.    

He's learned, a little, to skateboard.   He starts a soccer clinic today.  

I mean, we do shit.  We stay busy and i try to find a balance between having a life and avoiding the coronavirus.   From March until June, he had one of his laid off daycare teachers come over and care for him during the day while i had lots of work stuff scheduled that day each week.  I mean - he sees people, he days are structured, he gets education and excerise, he's entertained, he socializes - not as much as he used to  but we're doing ok. 

I just don't want to be in people's houses, i don't want to be in big crowds, i don't go out to eat (i'll eat outside if tables are spaced - which we've done twice).  i don't want my kid in daycare.

i want my kid to wear a mask, i want everyone around us to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer, people shouldn't drink after each other.  

i'm not asking a lot.  and i feel more comfortable being around people who don't have to be forced to wear a mask and clean their fucking hands and who have the sense to not drink after other people. 

but they push and push and push.  everytime you find a new way for them to get a dig in, or manipulate my kid, or push memes downplaying coronavirus (with the obvious conclusion being that we shouldn't worry about it at all).

they act like invincible teenagers.  the only deaths that matter are the ones that happened under Democrat mayors and governors.  The virus is only looked at politically and by no other measure and so me and my ""liberal"" wife are just ""cowering in fear"" sort of thing.  they basically say that without saying it directly.   

but thanksgiving is coming.  Christmas is coming.  they now live 1.25 miles away.

wtf do i do.  Both of these events will have my great grandmother.   My uncle - who's dying and will not make it anotehr year b/c he takes such poor care of himself - and he's really really unsanitary in the extreme and is in and out of hospitals weekly.  

but overall, i see it as us having another year of this shit.   my parents have already stated they won't be getting the vaccine.   They were against my kid's 4 year old doctor visit where he basically got 4 vaccines at once.   My father never gets the flu vaccine b/c he swears his father got the flu everytime he got the flu shot every year.   

These are the type of assholes that, to this day, do not wear their seatbelts. They'll let the car beep at them for 5 minutes rather than put it on.  They're like this in other people's cars too.  My father is the type that smokes in non-smoking areas of hospitals and is always ran off by security and gets into conflicts with them about it.  

You have to drag them, kicking and screaming, to make the ""right"" choices on the smallest of things.. but i'm the coward.  I'm harming my kid by keeping him away from kids at daycare.   they manipulate my kid to make me and my wife out to be the bad guys when he gets him to ask to spend the night.

my mother will even say ""your mom will hate me for asking this"" or something to that effect - b/c she knows my wife will say no but she'll push my 4 year old with it anyways.

and now it's all ""why don't you just swing by"" b/c we're not even a whole song on the radio away fromt heir house.  So our avoidance of them can't be excused with the 25-30 minute trip to their house and back anymore. 

the covid stuff aside, they've just been intolerable. my mother especially.  I share pictures over an encrypted chat medium to keep them ""involved"" even though we reduce visits and such and my mother always has something negative to say

* i share education pics, and she critiques him writing letters incorrectly
* i share pics of him doing art projects, and he holds his paintbrush wrong
* pics of him on a skateboard and they literally got mad at me for him having one at all even though i had one and my kid had helmet and pads and i never did
* pics of my kid boogie boarding at the beach, b/c apparently they could see ""riptides"" in still pics or low res videos.  he had a life vest on and was attached tothe board by a string.
* pics of my kid 50-100 yrds away from me at a soccer field at 8am, b/c ""you never know. .. a pedophile could jump out and grab your kid. you need to be closer to him""
* criticisms of cute videos of him singing and playing guitar... b/c of the music we let him listen to (weezer of all things) b/c lyrics say things like "" i don't give a hoot what you think"". 
* my kid has been helping me cook for about a year now and i get constant shit for any picture of him making pancakes or french toast or mac n cheese or tortilla shells from scratch b/c ""one day he's going to do it on his own and burn himself!""
* i get shit of him helping me with yard work.  He'll push the lawnmower for a strip or has helped me dig in our garden - and everything from hand shovels to whatever are going to hurt him and w'ere not careful enough.
* i got criticism b/c he was 4 and still had training wheels on.  I got criticism b/c he never really learned to ride a tricycle the proper way and just skipped right to a bike.  My mother has literally gone all drill sergant/football coach with him on a tricycle to get him to ""pedal correctly"" 
* i've gotten shit of pics or stories of him watching classic horror (like 1930s-1950s stuff) or scifi things (Godzilla) or even ""spooky"" kids stuff like Nightmare before christmas or Casper.

We recently cancellated his birthday party b/c of the rain - we had a pinata, stuff for smores, fireworks for the cul de sac (neighbor kids are attending), sparklers, silly string, and food for a cookout.  We sent pics of just family time at home and you could tell they were annoyed they had their grandkid taken from them once again b/c we wouldn't move things ""indoors"".  

it's just constant negativity. 

constant ""we're doing it wrong"".   They guilt me for 'taking away his socialization"" and subtley and sometimes not so much, browbeat me with this constant nitpicking of all the things i'm doing wrong or being careless about...and then follow it up with how i'm overly strict and tight about my kid's health regarding covid.

my kid eats fast food.  right? He gets ice cream, he gets some prepackaged food that might not be the best for him.  He both eats better and worse than i did as a kid, simultaneously.    But i try to teach him about nutrition, what junk is and isn't.  He eats more veggies than i ever did as a kid - brussel sprouts, asparagus, salad, broccoli, beans, etc.. and since covid, we've spent far more time cooking things from scratch at home.  I don't push my health anxiety onto him or anything.  i really don't.   but they're convinced b/c i try to limit the junk to weekly rather than daily that i'm going to give him a ""neurotic complex about food"".    And so of course every time they see him they're pushing off candy and shoving junk at him every, single, time...

They're just constantly undermining me bidirectionally.  I don't care enough in all these areas, but i'm paranoid and fearful in all these other ones.   And i'm just over it.

But man i don't want a confrontation.  I don't want to cut them off either, and that's an option b/c i think a confrontation is just a pause on bad behavior rather than a cessation of it. i just feel... frustrated.

It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve been working with him on very much over the years. This year, he‚Äôs finally doing well with the other kids in school and he gets soooo excited now when we see another kid out in public. We‚Äôre so happy about his progress! 

He has a cousin who is his age that he only sees a few times a year because they live out of state. The kids are very different from each other, even though they‚Äôre the same age. It‚Äôs like oil and water. My son is on the extreme shy side, the other boy is on the extreme outgoing side. The other boy also has some language and developmental delays / sensory issues and my son has a very high IQ (has been tested as ‚Äúgifted‚Äù - I hate that word but helps for context here) so he‚Äôs ahead on a lot of milestones for this age. So even though they‚Äôre the same age, they are literal opposites with different needs and capabilities. 

My son has always been a little nervous around this boy but it has escalated this year. We‚Äôre so shocked by it because he‚Äôs gotten so much better with kids at school and out in public so we can‚Äôt figure out why it‚Äôs gotten worse with his cousin. It‚Äôs literally only his cousin that this happens with. 

I observed my son in school at the permission of his teacher recently and I noticed that the other 4 year olds in his class are a lot calmer than my nephew is. They play together but they also keep their space more whereas my nephew reminds me more of a younger kid who runs up to my son, yanks toys out of his hands, and just says ‚Äúplay play play‚Äù in my son‚Äôs face nonstop. My nephew also doesn‚Äôt actually appear to know *how* to play with my son besides simple things like rolling a ball or playing chase, which my son finds boring after a minute or 2. In school, my son is playing pretend with the other kids and building things and whatnot. My nephew doesn‚Äôt appear to know how to play pretend. My nephew is kind of like the energizer bunny - always jumping, moving, saying ‚Äúplay play play‚Äù on repeat, etc. without actually playing with toys (parallel or together) and that makes it hard for them to play together too (in addition to my son‚Äôs fear of him). In a normal situation, I would get on the floor with the two of them and gently guide them towards playing together but when I try to do that, it becomes clear very quickly that they have very different play skill sets and my son‚Äôs play is too complex for my nephew and my nephew‚Äôs play gets boring after a few minutes to my son. I often feel like my nephew doesn‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying too which makes things harder. 

My nephew is such a sweet boy and of course he‚Äôs harmless but for whatever reason, he scares the crap out of my son. My son shrieks, hides, tells him to go away, has tantrums, etc when my nephew is around. We don‚Äôt see this behavior in any other setting. On the way home the other day, my son told me that he‚Äôs scared and that‚Äôs why he was acting that way. He said he doesn‚Äôt like that his cousin always gets so close to him. Like I said before, my nephew has no concept of space whereas my son‚Äôs classmates seem to be more cognizant of personal space and how to interact socially more appropriately, if that makes sense. 

Anyway, I just don‚Äôt know how to help make the situation better. I don‚Äôt want my son to be so upset because that upsets me... and I also want my son to enjoy being with his family and for his family to see the real him and not this scared kid who is acting out because he‚Äôs so afraid. 

Obviously when they‚Äôre older, my son will understand that his cousin is not someone to be scared of. But at 4, my boy who is shy and has some anxiety issues is absolutely spooked by his cousin. I don‚Äôt want to invalidate those fears but I also want to help him get over this fear as much as I can.

Watching him fall asleep tonight it got me thinking: It took a bit of effort to fill his bucket, but we did it. What would it take to fill MY bucket? I hadn‚Äôt even thought of it like that and it‚Äôs something he encountered in his distance classes. So he taught me something.

What would fill my bucket if I had one? 

When we‚Äôre little the bucket is small and it‚Äôs easier to fill. As we age the bucket gets bigger and it‚Äôs more challenging to fill. Clearly it takes more to fill buckets my size. What would be in my bucket?

Fun with my son fills a lot of it for sure. Reclaiming my positive relationship with his dad (my partner) fills more of it. Relationships with my family and friends fill the bucket nearly to full. But there‚Äôs still a little room left I realize is meant just for me. What would I fill that space with?

I might fill it with poetry, or drawing which I love. I might fill it with woodworking or crafting which I also love. I might fill it with meditation which is absolutely invaluable. I might fill it with a family walk where I‚Äôm constantly afraid of cougars (we live very near the woods, to my credit). I might fill it listening to and sharing my favorite music from times past or discovering new music we all love. Or I might fill that space going on a drive, or window shopping online. I might spend it sewing up my favorite sweater for the 100th time. That little bit of time after I‚Äôve tried to be super me is for me. I do what I want. Tonight I drew a dinosaur in my son‚Äôs ongoing beastiary. And I had a couple lemon drops doing it. It was fun.

My son taught me something today about the human experience and it is a very valuable piece of information.

Some days it‚Äôs fine, some days she‚Äôs not as bad, some days I can tolerate it better. 

But there‚Äôs so many days where she screams literally at every single thing I do unless it‚Äôs exactly what she wants. She‚Äôs 18 months. 

I get up in the morning and she hollers unless I carry her with me into the bathroom, hold her while I pee, etc. 
I couldn‚Äôt fold my laundry today bc she decided she was only happy if she was sitting/jumping on me and throwing our clothes around everywhere that I was folding. So I just stopped. I tried doing it when she fell asleep but she heard me get up and started yelling so that failed too.

I‚Äôm 38 weeks pregnant due with a second baby in two weeks and I get nothing done. I have a bunch of stuff to set up etc but it‚Äôs so hard to with her around. I don‚Äôt hAve any help from family/friends and her dad can‚Äôt handle taking care of her by himself for more than an hour bc he complains how whiny she was the whole time, so I feel pressured taking an hour Away from her and forget any time longer than that. 

She‚Äôs extremely clingy, whenever I do anything she screams. I try to clean... she screams. I try to lay on my bed.. she screams and pulls my hand and says ‚Äúwalk walk walk walk‚Äù yelling until I get up. 

I just had to leave the room bc she was trying to open drawers that have things in them that she can‚Äôt have and she wouldn‚Äôt stop no matter how many times I said stop and pulled her away from them, she went right back and opened them then screamed when I pulled her away. So I just got up and left because I started shouting at her (her dads in the room so she‚Äôs fine - I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this anymore and I needed to get away from her before I started yelling loud)

I‚Äôm pretty much with her 97% of the day everyday and sometimes I feel sick of being around her and that makes me feel Awful. But a lot of the days everything I do
Makes her whine and yell at me. I often don‚Äôt go to the bathroom when I have to etc so I don‚Äôt have to have her give me a tantrum. 

Even if she‚Äôs napping, if I leave the room 7/10 times she wakes up and cries until I lay with her for her whole nap. 

If I‚Äôm on the other side of my room cleaning, she runs on our bed (my mattress is on the floor bc we co sleep a lot bc of how she is) and runs across the mattress blindly so I have to run across the room to catch her so she doesn‚Äôt fall off and smash her head. She does this whenever I‚Äôm trying to do anything, so then I can‚Äôt complete my task bc I have to run back to catch her from falling off and getting hurt, or she will do bad things to get attention and furthermore stop me from completing a task (like sometimes she‚Äôll stick things her hand or objects down her mouth and start gagging or a few times puked). I‚Äôm so annoyed and irritated from her constant yelling at me. I feel like every time I move a finger she screams and it upsets her. Like everything I do makes her angry and I dread literally doing anything bc it means she‚Äôs gonna yell at me and I feel so exhausted. 

We live at my moms right now so the house isn‚Äôt baby prooofed as it‚Äôs not my house and they don‚Äôt let me do much to it so that‚Äôs also stressful bc it‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúno no no no stop no‚Äù that‚Äôs annoying as well. 

I know she loves me and it‚Äôs sweet and all, but I literally get nothing done. I spend tons of time playing with her, she‚Äôs fed enough, i try to get her to sleep as much as she should be. I‚Äôm just tired ,8 feel like she‚Äôs always in my face. I know it‚Äôs not her fault and I try to be patient and some days it‚Äôs fine but a lot of the time it‚Äôs too much for me and I feel so overwhelmed and irritated.. like I literally won‚Äôt pee or drink for hours just so I don‚Äôt have to hear her yelling at me and throwing a tantrum. I don‚Äôt eat anything she can‚Äôt have until she goes to Sleep (popcorn etc) bc otherwise she flips out if she can‚Äôt have any.

The usual not listening, not cleaning up and eating all over the place leaving crumbs and destroying things around the house, son broke a door lock by accident etc. Nothing out of the ordinary for kids but also feel at their age, they should understand, even for a second, that they should take care of the house and actually treat it like it‚Äôs their home not just some trash place. 

Earlier tonight I found a nasty banana peel basically hidden in the basement (where we‚Äôve told them time after time they are not allowed to eat down there) and there was literally an infestation forming with fruit flies and their egg sacks growing from the rotten banana peel. It was so friggin disgusting and my last draw after they completely turned the house upside down this weekend. I lost it and yelled at both of them and made both of them cry. I did not tuck them to bed tonight when they asked like I normally do and told them to just fix their own blankets and go to bed. I was just so fed up and tired of everything. I know this is all part of parenting and what happened wasn‚Äôt really a big deal but I guess something just really got to me today.

He even had an American accent while attending a British school.

Anyway, my parents decided for the sake of his education, and because we were US citizens for us to finally move back and for my brother to finish high-school in the US to go to college, he was so excited and ready for his new life. Within a couple of weeks, he already hated it. Started saying things with a British accent, wouldn't stop talking about his old friends and decided he wanted to go to college in the UK. My parents were/are FURIOUS. Fast forward to today, he has an unflinching British accent and a holier-than-thou attitude where he thinks life will be better for him in the UK. My brother is 100% one of those people that always thinks the grass is greener on the other side.

My parents desperately want him to stay in the US for college to be close to family but also they don't understand where this negative attitude came from, especially during a pandemic, he doesn't really understand what life can be like in the US. Every night ends up in a screaming match with my mom's argument is we moved here for you/you can't just move countries when you want/you need to adapt/our family is here now etc.  He is 100% determined to go to school in the UK which breaks my parents heart as they have sacrificed a lot to bring us to the US...

I'm just really feeling like I'm the worst father/husband ever for not being able to just deal with all this. I'm sure I'm not the only one that has felt this way, so I wanted to (virtually) be around people who might have been there. 

I'm at wits end at home. I have an 8yo daughter and a 9mo son. My wife is in medical school and so is crazy busy and stressed out, leaving me to work full time, take care of chores, and take care of the kids. My daughter thankfully can go to school, but my in laws watch my son during the week.

Let's start with my son, since that's really straight forward. He basically needs attention 100% of the time. Which is to be expected. Problem is, he seems to also want to be carried all the time, which I wouldn't have a problem with except I've had really bad back pain for the last week and a half or so (possibly from carrying him so much -- it's a catch 22). He's actually really good and not that bad, logically know that I actually don't have it that bad with him. He's teething (both the bottom front teeth have erupted) right now so that's not helping his mood.

Next my wife. Like I mentioned, she's very rarely around. And honestly, that's what I signed up for when I married her. I promised her that I'd support her through med school, and it's been a rough time until now, and I know things are probably going to get tougher, but I'm not upset about it. Love and emotions aside, this is an investment. I take care of everything for the duration of school, and she becomes a doctor and while we probably won't be rich, money won't be a stressor anymore. I understand that, and I appreciate that she's ok with that (my ""career aspiration"" is stay at home dad, maybe with a part time job or something for spending money), but it's tough. It doesn't help that her personality makes it hard for her to see things from other people's shoes. She's constantly telling me how I have the day off tomorrow so I should take the kids to the park or whatever. Which, I mean, I could. But between anxiety about covid-19, the timing of everyone's moods and naps and stuff not working, and me plain being exhausted, it doesn't happen as often as I'd like it to. I know she's not judging me, but it hurts when she seems disappointed that I'm not doing activities with them. She also doesn't seem to understand how tired I am, and doesn't clearly communicate her own needs either. More often than not, I take care of every feeding during the night, and therefore get practically no sleep (my son wakes up every hour and a half to two hours, it takes about half an hour to 45 minutes to feed and comfort him until he's asleep, then I take a while to go back to sleep too). Some mornings she'll off hand mention how our son slept really well, and come to realize she didn't even notice that he was waking up. There have been several times when I would mention how tired I am, and instead of empathizing, she would tell me how much work she has at school, how stressed she is about an upcoming test, and how she goes to bed so late. What could've ended with her thanking me for watching our son, offering me an energy drink (she gets kind of upset when I drink them, which I understand, but it's either that or I'm not functioning. I'm sensitive to coffee, it makes me nauseous and gives me tunnel vision, and tea and soda don't really do anything for me anymore), or even just saying, ""aw, that sucks, I'm sorry,"" turns into me just feeling bad that I don't have it as tough as her. Besides being tired, if I complain about something (coworker annoyed me today, daughter was being sassy, etc.) she tries to make me see the other person's point of view. But that's really not what I want, I just want her to agree with me and make me feel better; I can rationalize everything later when I'm not as upset about it. She tends to take things I say to mean the worst possible thing too. One time I mentioned that I'd love to have a day off without the kids some time; maybe her parents could watch them one weekend? She got upset, and said something along the lines of ""I didn't realize you didn't like spending time with them."" So I try not to complain to her about anything anymore.

My daughter apparently is at an age where she has one of two moods: I love daddy, he's the best ever, and I'm going to take everything daddy says super literally and try to make him extra mad. 

I hate that as soon as I wrote that last sentence she came in with a huge smile and showed me a funny drawing that she made. 

Usually, she's the sweetest thing. She's sensitive, apologizes quickly when she's made a mistake, and is super helpful. She's also a fantastic big sister, even now she's excited to help with my son. 

Sometimes, though, she won't be able to hear me. Like I'll call her name, she'll respond, and even though I'm standing right next to her and taking to her (please do your homework now, go get ready for bed, let's eat dinner, etc.) she actually isn't hearing anything I'm saying. I'll finish telling her whatever I was going to tell her, and a few minutes later I'll realize she hasn't moved. When I ask her what happened, she completely blanks on the whole conversation. She then gets offended when I have to micromanage her to make sure she's doing everything, and frankly it's a waste of my time too. Then she'll go into a mood where she will take everything I say super literally, or assume things I'm absolutely not saying. Today, for example, she was doing her homework, and I asked her about a small mistake. She didn't understand what I was telling her, but got frustrated when I kept talking about it, trying to get her to fix it. It got to the point where I ended up telling her ""well either way, this is wrong, so we need to erase this word, and I can try to explain why after you're done,"" and she started erasing the whole page. When I asked her why she would do that, she retorted that I had told her to ""erase this."" Which is technically true but isn't what I meant, and I know she knows what I meant. 

Which brings me to my own problems. I was let go from a job I had been in for going on 10 years very unfairly (not COVID related, it was all politics) about a year ago, and have been working in a new (admittedly better) job after about a 2 month search. I've been crazy anxious at the new job; I constantly feel like people are judging my work, and looking for reasons to fire me. My therapist said I'm essentially suffering from PTSD from being let go from my old job, and it makes a lot of sense. Essentially people that I trusted suddenly and without warning turned on me, putting me in an extremely stressful situation. That's why I am now on guard for people to do that to me again. Which is stupid because when I'm being reasonable, I know that my new coworkers and my new boss (and her boss above her) are very nice people, and I have had no reason to feel like they're doing anything like that. It also doesn't help that my therapist no longer accepts my insurance, and the last appointment that was supposed to be to help me find a new therapist was cancelled due to COVID. I have had terrible luck with therapists (one put me on medication even though I specifically said I didn't want it, one was crazy rude to me, and one only wanted to talk to me about Jesus -- I'm Buddhist) for a good portion of my life, and it took a lot of convincing from my wife to even see this one, and while I know it's not my fault, I still feel betrayed. She's been trying to get me to find another one but I just don't feel like going through the whole thing again.

Plus, I don't want to spend money on that. I make pretty decent money, don't get me wrong, but being that I'm the sole income, I'm constantly stressed out about money. We have enough, but it's ""just"" enough. We've been paycheck to paycheck for a very long time. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change my choices, I have steadily been promoted several times over that period, and make enough money to support us. We won't be going broke or losing our home any time soon. But we're also close enough to that line that making a mistake somewhere, or someone getting really sick or injured, will have the potential to put us in a bad place. 

I also don't have any friends that are just friends (not coworkers) and just my friends (and not my wife's friends that are now my friends). Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but I've never really had that. I went to the kind of school where practically no one stays for more than a few years (of course, I did), and honestly looking back the friends I did have during that time were pretty terrible friends. I grew up in city A, went to college in city B, and now live in city C (and we're not taking like three cities in one state or anything; there definitely would be airplanes involved), and so even my good friends from college are far away. I talk to them from time to time, but haven't seen them in years. It's always been a pain point of mine, like something is missing from my life. I see other people hanging out with friends they've known their whole lives and get jealous. Hell, my wife's best friend she's known since preschool. I'm at the stage of life where you just don't meet new people though, and it's not like I can just go out whenever I want. I'm also relatively young to have two kids, so parent groups are people significantly older than me, and while that's not keeping me from meeting people I get along with, it also means I'm not about to meet my new best friend there either. My wife doesn't get it, either, that sometimes I want to go out without being a husband or a dad. Like sometimes I just want to hang out with my friends and not worry about that for a while. She gets kind of offended if I don't invite her, or sometimes will just assume I'm bringing the family. So I stopped making plans with people unless it's meant to be me plus one (or three).

What pisses me off (at myself) about all of this is that everything can be very simply explained. My son is an infant, infants need attention and are a challenge. My wife is a medical student, they're stressed out and extremely busy. My daughter is a kid, kids are weird like that sometimes. I'm burnt out and suffer from pseudo PTSD, of course I'm exhausted and anxious. But all of that combined makes me so miserable, so stressed out, and so exhausted, that sometimes I just go blank and can't function. Earlier my daughter was arguing so much, and my son had been crying for 10 minutes straight, and my wife just let me know that she was going to be late tonight meaning I'd have to take care of the kids by myself for an extra few hours, that I just locked myself in the bathroom and sat there for a few minutes because I couldn't process how to handle everything anymore. This has been happening more and more often recently and I hate it.

My husband and I recently had our first child. We have decided to vaccinate him, on a slightly modified schedule, and with careful attention to the source of the vaccines.

At the last minute we check on her (after 7-10 other checks) only to find her either still in bed, or staring at herself in a stupor as though the magic mirror on the wall is going to get her ready for the morning. It reminds me of my college days with a hangover hammering on my brains and knowing I have an 8am test ahead of me. 

No matter what we do, how much we ground her, or how much we threaten her, she doesn‚Äôt get up when we wake her. I‚Äôve pulled her out of the bed and watched her noggin flop off the bed to the pillow I‚Äôve placed on the floor. When she finally wakes up she‚Äôs screaming and blaming everyone else for her lack of sleep, tangled hair, bad breath, etc. 

Last week, after an episode where she made everyone late to work and school, my wife (key term ‚Äúwife‚Äù - spouse who makes idle threats in hopes of formulating a plan of execution later when necessary) - warned her that she‚Äôd be ‚Äúwalking to school‚Äù if this happened again. It did, however, happen again, but the threat from my wife that morning made her burst into tears, begging her mom not make her. Of course a good loving mom wants to give her one last chance, also knowing that she herself has to get to work. The girl somehow throws herself together, messy hair, bad breath and all in order to get school in the nick-of-time... off the hook this time. 

But today, no such luck. Again she didn‚Äôt wake up and we find her, as we near the 5 minute point of no return, still in her PJs locked in the bathroom. Again the threats ensue and my wife is serious this time. I‚Äôm just hanging around as a courtesy to make sure I can‚Äôt help in any way move this along. I quickly realized that I would be the one executing this plan, being the only parent with flexible enough schedule to have the morning blow up without losing a job. How did I not see this coming üôÑ. Now she‚Äôs begging me and explaining how this is her worst fear (thanks to her older sister), walking alone and being kidnapped. 

So my wife lays down the law the leaves for work, my daughter is hyperventilating and sobbing, I‚Äôm trying to formulate a plan, call the boss, notify the team, and not try to laugh out loud at this insane morning! She and I went over the map, made a plan of action, and then I booted her out the front door and she took off walking.

Proud dad moment - this poor girl sucked it up and took off walking on a route she‚Äôs never been on before. She looked both ways, and used the busy street cross walk at the light like we‚Äôd always hoped she would. She walked swiftly and confidently from block to block and I was proud and hurt for her at the same time. She cried the whole way and spotted me a couple of times driving by, but half way there, I yelled that I‚Äôd see her at the school as I drove by. Instead, I drove down the road until out of sight and circled back around, this time watching her from one block over. I‚Äôd only see her cross from one street to the next, but I knew I‚Äôd be able to get to her if she didn‚Äôt show up within a few seconds. 

I called my wife and let her know that she was be fine, but I‚Äôd probably be picked up for suspicious activity, stalking a little girl walking to school. Thank the Lord that didn‚Äôt happen, and I ended up pulling up behind her the parking lot of her school 25 minutes later. She cried and we hugged and talked about needing to make a change. She agreed, and kissed her in the head and she went in. She was definitely impacted, but whether or not it was effective, only time will tell. 

After school this evening she said her teacher, having not yet read my wife‚Äôs email explaining the situation, asked her why she was so late to class, in front of everyone. My daughter isn‚Äôt shy so she explained. You can image the laughter and looks from her peers. We received an email this evening from that teacher commending us for our discipline and wishing other parents would do the same. I pray we don‚Äôt have to do this again, because I DID cry. I wanted to pick her up after the second block and see if she learned any lessons, but I think it was best to play it out to the end. Now she knows we are serious about this and probably anything else (I hope). In our discussions over dinner, I pointed out that she should have also learned that she is resilient and strong, able to face her greatest fear, and win. 

I don‚Äôt know if this will make a difference, but if it doesn‚Äôt - does anyone have any ideas, because we‚Äôre out?

Thanks if you read to the end!  Make it a great day!

I learned then that the first month is not necessarily the hardest! That's when ""the baby news is still fresh"" and everyone who wants to pitch in to help has already signed up to come by and help out. For us, it was when our parents came too, so we actually had a LOT of help for the first two weeks. 

I recall it being in weeks 4-8 (and beyond) that the job got harder. The frozen meals everyone gave us got eaten up, there was nobody to help walk the dog, and my wife's c-section still hadn't fully healed yet so she was limited in mobility. It was THIS period that would've been great to be there to help.   


Now that we're expecting again üéâ I want to use my 4 weeks of paternity leave smarter, maybe by doing something like...

1. **Week 1: leave**
2. Weeks 2-3: work
3. **Weeks 4-5: leave**
4. Weeks 6-8: work
5. **Week 9: leave** 

...or something like that.

He has been going through some rough times in his life right now especially when it comes to dealing with my parents. My parents have expressed to me the same about him. I just moved out about 6 months ago in a fit of rage with my parent when they decided to take away my personal property as a punishment for my siblings. These items were various game systems and my personal computer that I all payed for with my own money. My parents are firm believers that using these technologies for anything aside from education is detrimental to our well being and mental state. 

Ever since I moved out from my parents house my parents have gotten rid of everything that my younger sibling finds entertaining because they felt after that I moved out, it caused my brother to lose respect for them. This is most likely true considering how he has been acting since. He knows full and well his responsibilities around the house and pertaining to school, however, whenever my parents ask him to do something, it is usually followed with a threat of taking something away which in turn causes him to specifically rebel and do the exact opposite of what he has been told.

The only person that can get him to hold him self accountable for his actions is me, and I can tell my parents despise that I still have his respect and they don't. This in turn causes them to punish him more for being disrespectful, and there have been a few times where it has gotten to the point where my mom will physically move him down to his room and ensure that he does not come out until he has learned his lesson. My younger brother has just learned to accept this and will no longer do anything willingly for my parents and my parents just push back in the same way and the situation isn't improving for either one of them. 

I have heard my Dad wants to give him up to foster care and that if this continues with no improvement he will carry out this. He does the things my parents expect when I ask him to do them because he knows I am sympathetic with his situation and understands his responsibility to keep his grades up and such because I had trouble with it when I was younger too. But I cannot be there all the time to hold him accountable and I want to teach him to be that way as well, but whenever my parents intervene, usually with some form of punishment, he ends up right back where he started.

He would ask me if I would like it if he hurt another part of my body so that I would stop thinking about the one that was currently in pain.  For example, if I fell and hit my arm and was crying about my arm being in pain, he would ask me if I would like it he stepped on my foot so that I would stop thinking about my arm and now focus on my foot.  My answer was always no, usually accompanied by a chuckle.  
 
So yesterday, I did the same with my daughter.  She fell trying to put something away in her closet and I found her crying.  I asked her if she was ok, if she wanted a hug (to which she said yes) and so I hugged her.  After her sobbing turned to sniffling I asked her if she would like me to step on her foot so she wouldn't have to think about her butt hurting anymore.  She looked up and with a smirk said ""No!"" 
 
I reflected on this - both the joke I made to my daughter, her reaction, the joke my dad use to make in the same way, my old similar reactions and life itself.  I thought about how often we try to soothe our hurts by distracting ourselves with other things.  And even worse, how often do we add insult to injury to make the situation worse still? And yet how often do we teach this habit to our own children? My daughter intuitively knew that me stepping on her foot wasn't going to fix her butt that was hurting.  It was only to go add on another pain.  Now she would have a hurt foot AND a hurt buttocks.  She's 7 and she knew this.  When I was young, I intuitively knew this too.  Deep down we all know this.  Yet how often do our emotional reactions make a bad situation even worse?  If the milk has spilled, does yelling about it make it better?  If the plate is broken, does our emotional response fix it?  If our child has done something we disapprove of, how do we behave in an effective and productive way that also doesn't further the cycle of action/reaction - action/reaction?  This is not a 1,2,3 step process but a complete change to what I call conscious parenting and conscious living.  I will be addressing this question in future posts but for now, just keep in mind that every move you make, every word you use, every look, every tone are all teaching something to your children and also reinforcing behavioral patterns in us.  This can be terrifying but it is also beautiful.  I hope you can see both and begin to embrace the power you have to change this world through the relationships you develop and maintain with your own children.

She obviously thinks everything her sister does is awesome and wants to play with all of older sister's toys.  

Older sister - more serious and more moody and stubborn. Has to have an incentive to help. When in bad mood or feeling tired a lot of times I (the father) can tell that she is just looking for something to say no to to have a meltdown over. So, as an example, it could be that she is reading a book on the kindle after dinner and time is approaching for shower and brushing teeth and getting ready for bed. I give her a notice that she has 5 min to finish what she's doing and go shower and brush teeth and then she can maybe read a bit in bed after she's done that. She proceeds into the shower with kindle in hand (it has been mentioned by me that the kindle is water proof, by the way) but I tell her it's inappropriate to shower with the kindle because it will get soapy and will waste water and she should put it down, shower and can continue after. She refuses and we basically have an argument which escalates while I try to explain to her that she needs to see that she's trading her reading time after the shower for the standoff we're currently having just because she cannot put the book down for 2 min... I also try to get her to think about the outcome she wants - continue reading - rather than the feeling she's currently having - daddy is telling me no. 

Anyway, this usually leads to time running out of having time to read and me or her mother physically taking the kindle away and her crying and screaming the rest of the night, sometimes un-showered.  

Anyway, that's just to set the stage of the kind of stubbornness we're dealing with. As for her relationship with her sister - they play perfectly fine overall. There's obvious some friction about ""my dolls"" on both sides with sharing and who can touch what, etc.  

The issue I'm curious to discuss though is lately (probably since the start of the school post the pandemic lockdown) the older one has been pushing the younger one away a bit more. In addition to the usual ""don't touch my stuff"" now there's a weird (in my opinion) thing that she does where she ""gets a bad feeling"" when the younger one is looking at her, or comes close to her. If the younger one touches one of the toys, the older one the other day went and got a napkin to clean it off. She tells the younger one it's because she's ""sweaty"". One time the older one would not leave the car through the same door the younger one went through. We refused to open the other door because everyone else already got out of the car and we were busy with getting the groceries out so it saw it as another ‚ÄúI want it my way‚Äù stubborn moment. She had to be physically removed from the car after she started banging her metal water bottle on the window while screaming. 

Anyway, the older one claims that ‚Äúshe gets a bad feeling‚Äù when the younger sister is doing stuff she doesn‚Äôt like. We had discussions about this and she says she ‚Äúknows‚Äù it‚Äôs bad behavior to tell the younger one she‚Äôs ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù or act like something is wrong with being around her. And she has kind of been dealing with it, as we discussed with her by telling the younger one, ‚Äúhey, I need some alone time‚Äù and removing herself to her room or somewhere else in the house away from the younger one. 

So lastly, what really upset me was the older one was putting LEGO bricks together and the younger one touched one and the older one made a showing of it again that she had to wipe it down after. Then the younger one is asking about a LEGO on the table and the older one says ‚Äúwhich one?‚Äù. She proceeds to play dumb like she can‚Äôt understand which one the younger one is referring to until the younger one finally comes in contact with it. At which point she goes ‚Äúooooooooooooooohhhh, you touched it‚Äù and then proceed to make a showing of wiping it down. That, to me, seems like a calculated mean thing to do and now I‚Äôm wondering if she needs some professional help before this becomes something more than just a temporary pushing her sibling away‚Ä¶

She has a history of some medical problems during her first year of life and overall being her parent has been rewarding but a bit exhausting. She was in physical therapy up until age 3 at which point she graduated. She is now in speech therapy. She is making strides with her speech but I feel she is behind in other areas. She still cannot dress herself - specifically shirts, dresses, socks. She is fully potty trained thankfully, but has a hard time with things that I feel like should be easy. She cannot buckle/unbuckle her car seat straps. Cannot trace a letter. Pretty much anything that requires fine motor skills or balance is a struggle.

I have been considering enrolling her in occupational therapy to help assist with this. Just another appointment added onto the list makes me want to cry. I hate the thought of her spending her childhood in a special needs class and worry about the social stigma that will bring as I really don't think she is that far behind to warrant her being in a special needs environment. 

I personally am struggling with it all. I was a very normal child with no medical issues and I just never imagined my child would have these issues. Any time I try and help her with something I find myself getting frustrated. I know it is not her fault and some kids really just learn at different paces. I was raised in a very competitive household where I was held to maybe an unrealistic standard and I feel like I may be portraying that onto her. I do try not to, it is just almost apart of my personality at this point and I'm working to correct it. 

Her dad and I are separated. He seems to handle her delays a lot better than I do which I am thankful for but I do have her a majority of the time and feel like I bear most of the worry about her development. 

I've vented to my mom about the anxiety I feel about my daughter's development and basically she thinks that I have too high of standards. She doesnt think my daughter needs occupational therapy and thinks she is fine and will catch up on her own. 

My boyfriend who has been in my daughter's life for 2 years now also thinks she will just grow out of it. He was not around when my daughter was in and out of the hospital during her first year and just sees a normal child who is 'lazy' and thinks I baby her too much by helping her buckle herself and dress herself etc. He thinks I need to stop helping her with everything and make her do it herself - which is pretty much how he was raised. I have tried that with her and it just leads to her and I both crying out of frustration.

My mother in law has people over constantly. Like her neighbor, her best friend, her brother, her nephew etc. And every damn time, my kids have it in their head that people are there for THEM. They're go from calm and playing quietly to these attention starved idiots. (yes i'm going with this word, no i don't actually call them that to their faces..)

I've tried explaining to them that my mother in law (who to be honest is such a stuffy boring person) doesn't want them around when she has company.  The oldest sometimes mellows out but the youngest will not hear any of it and the minute i keep my eyes off her she runs off to bother the guests again.

I hope you are all well and coping during these trying times.

My question is how to handle a situation with my sister who has kids. Her family consists of her, her husband and 3 kids aged (7, 4, 7months). They both work from home at the moment. Pre-pandemic we'd talk often, visit etc. During the pandemic it was mostly video chats. I noticed recently though that whenever I sent the kids present or something it was largely ignored.  I never expected a thank you or anything. Most of the times previously it was a photo with the kids' holding the present or a thank you text, or a text ""kids love it.""

Now it's like radio silence. I thought she was made at me. Fast forward to this behavior for the pas few months, I figure, ok, well, she's stressed. Home school, etc, work etc. I even sent her a book of calming end of day Quotes (I didn't get any acknowledgement of that).

I had a friend pass away this past week and I posted something on socials, I know they saw it (insta story), no message to say ""how ya doing?""

Anyway, it's the 7 year old's birthday this week. All of sudden I get a mass email, ""Sorry about the lateness of this. Here is his Amazon wish list. etc.""

I felt it was kind of rude.

Am I right to feel this way? I know parents are stressed at the moment. Even non-parents are going through the pandemic as well. However, I don't feel that ungrateful behavior should go unchecked.

He‚Äôs outgoing in social situations, enjoys making new friends, and doesn‚Äôt mind (likes) being the center of attention. He had almost no concept of ‚Äústranger danger‚Äù when he was a toddler. He enjoys situations where adults are sitting around being ‚Äúentertained‚Äù by him. 

My daughter (2) is much more shy and reserved. She reminds me more of myself as a child. She is chatty and comfortable around people she sees frequently, but typically enjoys sitting back and watching her brother be the center of attention in social situations. It probably doesn‚Äôt necessarily help that she has spent covid times only socializing with family/neighbors, but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm actively trying to change. If I see that she seems a little overwhelmed/nervous in social situations, I do my best to sit at her level and mediate to make her more comfortable. I don‚Äôt force her to speak to/show affection/attention to anyone she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with. 

I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù or change either of them. They both have wonderful personalities and people skills, they just enjoy different levels of outside attention/socializing. 

My problem lies more with extended family. They expect my daughter to be outgoing and funny in social situations like my son, but they are two entirely different people. 

Looking to see if anyone has experienced something similar, and has any advice on how to talk to family in the moment when they are doubling down and being pushy for my daughter to be more extroverted? 

I have really put my foot down when it comes to ‚Äúgood byes‚Äù and showing affection. If we are with my husband‚Äôs family and it‚Äôs time to say goodbye, my son will run to each person and give them a hug. My daughter is much pickier with her affection, and I support that. I don‚Äôt make her hug anyone she doesn‚Äôt want to. I encourage her to say goodbye however she wants (high five, waving, just saying bye, etc), but I can tell my husband‚Äôs family is silently judging her ‚Äúshyness‚Äù. They call her ‚Äúmama‚Äôs girl‚Äù or call her ‚Äúsassy‚Äù when she refuses affection or outward attention. 

How do I explain to them that her being more reserved and introverted isn‚Äôt a flaw? As she gets older, I don‚Äôt want her to feel pressured to be someone she isn‚Äôt. If I thought this was a true social development issue, I would address it, but I don‚Äôt think it is. She has hit all social milestones with close family/neighbors that she sees frequently.

We have a two year old who will be turning three at the end of January. I will preface this by saying he is very advanced as far as language goes and up until a few months ago he was a fairly easy child. 

In March, my husband and I started to work from home due to COVID. This had a big impact on our sons behaviour - leaving the home daycare he was at/not seeing friends/not understanding why mom and dad couldn‚Äôt play with him all the time frustrated him quite a bit. In April, we had a friend come and live with us who was basically a nanny for two months. This curbed my son‚Äôs aggression. She left in June as I started an early maternity leave. For 4 weeks, he was mostly well behaved and back to normal. End of July I give birth to a baby boy who required a lot of attention. We got support from my parents nearly every day for two months (they have been gone for 3 weeks now, coming back in 5 - they live here). 

All this to say, with so many caregivers, it feels like we‚Äôve lost control. He misbehaves constantly. The usual doesn‚Äôt work at all. We have tried positive parenting. We have tried the naughty step. We have tried removing privileges. We have tried rewards. 

Ex. Toddler will spend most of dinner singing to himself in a very loud voice. We engage in conversation with him, but the minute we have an adult discussion, he starts singing, yelling or repeatedly asking for our attention. We have tried explaining that he needs to wait his turn. We have tried a signal to let him know we‚Äôve heard him/know he‚Äôs next. We‚Äôve tried sending him for a time out. We have tried taking away his desert. It doesn‚Äôt work. 

Ex 2: Toddler is refusing his naps. Fairly sure he still needs them but after a while of him running out of his room we agree to quiet time. Toddler is in his room (gate locked or he wanders). We say he can read or play as long as he is quiet and relaxing, lights are off but there is light from the window. Still, most days, he‚Äôll come right up to the gate and YELL. He‚Äôll say he has to poop (he doesn‚Äôt) and will make a mess in his bedroom. He will call us up for all kinds of things. Again, we tried taking away toys and deserts. We tried to put words on it for him/narrate the behaviour. Nothing works. 

My husband is on the verge of a parental burnout and I‚Äôm starting to feel like a failure.  I would love any advice on how to deal with toddlers in general but specifically these two scenarios. Of all the behaviours, these are the most difficult to deal with.

I just figured parents might have a good perspective on this. 

My sister is 22 and lives alone with her 6yo daughter in an apartment just downstairs from mine. She has a job in a grocery store and makes enough to support herself and her daughter.

Because of years of horrible childhood trauma, some of it I don't even know about, my sister's mental state fluctuates quite a lot. Most of the time she seems like a perfectly healthy and happy person, as if the trauma didn't even happen at all. 

But there's times when it's as if the trauma hits her all at once. Sometimes it's like she doesn't even know where she is and she's terrified of everything, she hides and backs away from people and won't speak. Other times she gets mood swings and acts really erratic. Sometimes she just disappears for a while. 

During times like this she will drop her daughter off with me (I'm perfectly happy to babysit so it's not a problem for me at all) because she's aware that in the state she's in she can't take care of her. It's as if even during her worst moments her first instinct is to get her daughter somewhere safe. My niece could be here for a couple of hours or a couple of days, then when my sister is back to normal she comes to get her as if nothing ever happened. 

Until now, I've never had my niece for more than 2 nights. Tonight she's been with me for 6 nights and counting, and my sister has been barely responding to my messages, just enough to let me know she's safe. I don't think she's even been home all this time. Her episodes or whatever they are also seem to be more frequent now than before. My sister refuses to get professional help for this, and while she's having an episode she doesn't want me or anyone else around. I don't think she's ever put herself in danger or hurt herself but I'm not sure. 

My sister has never hurt her daughter, her daughter has never been left unsupervised and her needs have never been neglected. She's a happy and well-adjusted child who understands that sometimes her mom doesn't feel well so she comes to stay with her uncle until her mom feels better. I just worry that, especially if this happens more and more often or she stays with me for longer and longer times, it might not be good for her long term.

I would feel bad about getting CPS involved in case they realize my sister is mentally ill and just take her daughter away without actually looking into the situation, but I would also feel bad if this started damaging my niece's wellbeing and I didn't do anything.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2829728,public,self,How do I know if my sister has become unfit to raise her daughter?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/j9khwh/how_do_i_know_if_my_sister_has_become_unfit_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

She really hasn't wanted to sleep since an early age. She fights and struggles for every nap and bedtime is a disaster. Right now, she cries and screams for over an hour until she gets so exhausted that she falls asleep. Even then she will wake herself back up so that she can cry and scream some more. She will literally be asleep for a few minutes and then jolt herself awake only to cry and scream. She does this every single time she has to sleep. We are lost.
At 4 months my wife was going insane trying to get her to sleep every night. 3 hours of bouncing, rocking and nursing until she would fall asleep. We had read about the Ferber method and so we tried that for 2 weeks. 2 weeks of pure hell. 2 Hours of non-stop crying. Our check-ins just made her more upset. She never got the concept and only improved to about an hour of crying.
After 2 weeks, we gave up and my wife just started nursing her to sleep. She had no problems nursing. She would nurse and within 20 mins, be sound asleep. Which was Great! Buuuuuut things turned sour once again. She started to wake up after each sleep cycle. Every 40 minutes she would wake up and have to be nursed to sleep. My wife was getting zero sleep.
At 6 months, we hired a sleep consultant. She seemed nice and knowledgeable. We explained our situation and she said she she could easily help us. She started us out doing a small bedtime routine, getting her nice and calm and then going into the bedroom and putting her down in the crib. We were to stay in the room and do a voice, touch, pickup routine. Well it did not go well at all. 2+ hours of crying and being inconsolable. Finally out of exhaustion, she would fall asleep. But it was 2 hours of not only crying but angry screaming and crying. Feels like a knife through the heart. Things did improve over the next couple of days. She got down to under 2 hours of crying and only waking up twice during the night. The sleep consultant changed our method up and we were to only shhhush her. That didnt do anything for the next week. And then the sleep consultant changed us to the Ferber Method. That of course, didn't work either. Things didn't improve over the next week and the sleep consultant eventually ran out of options and and told us that she was ending the consultation. 
At this point in time, my wife and I are lost. Our help just quit on us.  Our daughter can't get herself to sleep. She cries when we even walk with her near the bedroom. Naps are a struggle. We are desperate. Looking for some advice.

My husband might of spanked him; I can‚Äôt remember but he spanked him tonight.  I know that‚Äôs the worse and my husband feels like a fucking asshole for doing it, but we didn‚Äôt know what else to do.  We give him consequences when he does wrong, we talk about why he does the things he does, how it not only effects him, but the family, as well.

The first time he did this was in 1st grade, not sure how much he got but he went through my purse to eat them.  He does the same with gummy vitamins and we‚Äôve gotten after him for that and explain that this too is like medicine. You cannot eat them because you think they taste good.

He has been at a small, private school since the preschool program (3 years old). He has always been a very happy, loving kid with a big heart. Last year he was in 5th grade and started seeming off. He was tired all the time. I was just thinking it was preteen weird hormone stuff. He would get angry and distant. I talked to him and as a family we decided to take him to public school where he could make friends. That was a big deal because I teach at his little, private school. Everyone was mad at me, but I switched him during the first quarter of school. 

Everything at public school went really well until about January when I started noticing the same behavior I switched his school over. He was having a small problem with another student. It wasn't anything worth being depressed over. A small private meeting with his teachers and he seemed okay again (not amazing, but okay). Then, COVID ended the school year short. This summer we mostly got along well, despite being stuck at home and all that. 

He was going to start private school at a new place this year and was pretty excited about it. That school didn't work out because of COVID related reasons.  So, we decided to bring him back to my school. I am the director of the older school kids, so he is essentially in my class all day now. There are 2 other teachers, but I am there all day. He is acting like an idiot in class, but not out of control. One reminder to chill and he stops. I don't feel like I have to boss him around too much really.

I have a boyfriend who I love, and we have an amazing, beautiful baby girl together. 

We had some issues when I was pregnant because he wasn‚Äôt very patient with me when I‚Äôd be moody and tired, but at the end of the day he did take care of me and make sure I was eating well, and I was happy that he was willing to stick around for his child and I (she was not planned). 

Now I‚Äôm getting pretty upset with him and I have to admit his behavior gives me doubts about us from time to time. He does provide for us (mostly, I still pay a portion of the rent and the phone bill with my savings) and he does love his child. No doubt about that. 

But, the biggest and greatest issue is he isn‚Äôt enthusiastic or happy about watching her and giving me a break. I‚Äôm in full time graduate school online, and it‚Äôs difficult balancing it with a newborn. He isn‚Äôt particularly supportive of me finishing my degree, either. In fights he‚Äôs said before ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault you‚Äôre in school‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you to go back to school,‚Äù if I mention a single thing about the stress it puts on me. He didn‚Äôt go to college so I guess he doesn‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs important to me or how hard it is. 

Back to the watching her issue, he will watch her while I run to the store, but I‚Äòve noticed if I‚Äôm gone for more than 30 minutes, he gets really angry at me. He has said things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you left her‚Äù or, more often, he says ‚Äúhurry! Wtf!!‚Äù I‚Äôve also noticed I can‚Äôt really ask him to watch her while I clean or work on school work... or even shower... without him rushing me, unless she‚Äôs asleep the entire time. 

Basically, it‚Äôs been really hard for me, and I‚Äôve been lying to my friends, my family, and his family about how helpful he is. Again, yes he loves her, he loves to see her smile and I know he is happy to pay for her things, but he doesn‚Äôt help me enough. This makes me think he doesn‚Äôt love me. 

Part of the reason he says it‚Äôs hard to watch her is his work. He truly is the hardest working person I‚Äôve ever met, but I don‚Äôt think he realizes that caring for a baby 24/7 without a single break (or a break more than an hour) is even more difficult than his line of work. I was sick this past weekend and I still did most of the care. His excuse is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the mom.‚Äù He even said to me once: ‚Äúwhy did you have a baby if you can‚Äôt handle it?‚Äù

I‚Äôm really trying my best here, and I love caring for my daughter. But what I would give for an hour of alone time, not an hour of him watching her while I do the dishes or catch up on school work. I know he would be mad if I took a nap or watched tv alone while he watched her. It‚Äôs like he thinks I don‚Äôt deserve it. 

We have some other issues like his anger management problems (he came home the other day telling me the dinner I cooked while I had a baby in my arms ‚Äútasted like shit‚Äù, shoved me once because I made a joke about him jerking off) qand I don‚Äôt feel like I get enough affection in this relationship, but my biggest one is this. I want so badly to be parents together but truthfully, I feel like the only one who is ‚Äúall in‚Äù in caring for her sometimes. 

Ps: therapy is not an option, I can‚Äôt imagine him going. I don‚Äôt think he would pay for it either, and I can‚Äôt afford it on my own. He also gets very angry during many conversations I have with him. I guess sometimes I approach it in an angry tone, but I truly am exhausted. 

Also, I really do love him and he is a nice guy. I also want to make it work for her. So I‚Äôd like to not break up. I can‚Äôt support myself on my own right now either.

I have an 11 month old baby girl. My mother in law and I often disagree but my baby ADORES her and she adores my baby. They are thick as thieves and she takes excellent care of her. 
Today was my first day back at work after maternity leave (I am a nurse in an ER, high stress, 12.5 hr shifts) and my MIL babysat. My FIL was there as well. He has recently started getting more involved with the baby but has always loved her very much, HOWEVER, he has always adamantly refused to change a diaper. He claims he knows how to do it and changed his son‚Äôs diaper plenty of times but that he just doesn‚Äôt want to. This annoys me to no end but I let it go, however it makes me highly unwilling to leave my child alone in his care for any extended period of time. 

Well today my MIL left my baby alone with my FIL for nearly an hour after putting her down for a nap in order to pick up her parents and bring them over and then again to take them home. The baby did not wake up but if she had she would have needed a diaper change. In addition, she did not run this by me at all. 

I put my foot down and said that he cannot be left alone with the baby like that. MIL was miles away and I left my child with her not FIL.

I've been concerned for some time about a clear language delay. He had speech therapy from 1 year old to 2 year old because his vocabulary reached about 100 words. The big issue is that he needs to be prompted for pretty much all of these words, and not in a subtle way either. 

Example: I am holding out some cookies for him trying to get him to say ""I want cookie"". So I say ""what do you want?"" he says ""want"". I repeat ""what do you want?"" he says ""want"" (repeating the last word of my sentence is pretty typical"". This goes on until I just say ""Say 'I want cookie'"" and he will then say it. 

Example 2: I am putting him to sleep. I say night night. no response. ""night night"" no response. I repeat this 5 times, and he still doesn't respond. Then I say ""say 'night night'"" and he repeats it right away. 

More than anything, he prefers to just cry when he wants something from me rather than actually try to ask for it. It is so frustrating, because I see other kids his age say ""mommy, mommy, mommy I'm hungry"". But for him he will just cry and I have to ask ""what do you want 5 times"" he just cries. Then I say ""You want milk?"" he repeats ""milk"". I feel like interacting with him is a chore because I he just isn't interested in putting in any effort. Like I am doing 99% of the conversation and he puts in 1%. 

It is so frustrating because at the same time, I KNOW he knows how to say these things. He understands commands and listens to them often (or chooses not to). But when it comes to language, he has not really gone past the 'repeat whatever they say' stage. He doesn't even say ""papa"" when I walk in the room, but will only say it when his mom will say it. If it was autism, at least I would have a clear idea that it isn't his fault, but this just feels like he just doesn't want to even try. He makes eye contact, he is social, he gives hugs, and loves to play wrestle with me. But as a dad, I just never expected simple interactions with him to be so difficult.

I want you to know I‚Äôve walked in your shoes. I‚Äôve had the same thoughts. I believed at times, I was failing. I remember thinking my baby didn‚Äôt like me. I remember thinking it was all too much: the baby crying, the long nights, the dirty diapers, the feedings and mainly all the advice.

Don‚Äôt doubt yourself. I did for many years, and I‚Äôve regretted every single tear that I shed. I should have spent more time trusting myself and believing that I was the best for my baby. 

I decided early on with both my children that I wasn‚Äôt cut out for breastfeeding...we were both suffering, so I stopped. I was made to feel as if I was the world‚Äôs worst mother.

I was told my baby would never be as intelligent as other babies because I made the wrong decision...my baby graduated high school with an average of 93% taking all advanced classes and has now moved on to University.

Basically, it took us (me and my partner) a while to get our little one (nearly 18 month old daughter) to sleep at night - it used to be a battle every night and it was completely exhausting. Me and my OH barely got any time to ourselves. Finally we decided to try the controlled crying technique and now we‚Äôre able to put her down at 7pm and she sleeps straight away without any trouble - success! It‚Äôs been working for about 3 months now. 

The only problem is she now starts waking up around midnight / 1am every night. It‚Äôs probably our own fault but because we know it works, we‚Äôve been bringing her into our bed and she‚Äôs been sleeping there for the rest of the night (even though she shuffles and wriggles and wakes us both up every 10 mins!). Now it‚Äôs come to the point we want to change it, but how do we start? I‚Äôve tried the controlled crying technique in the middle of the night but it hasn‚Äôt seemed to have had the same effect - it might be because I‚Äôm less patient when tired!

How does everybody else do it? I‚Äôve heard some amazing stories of their LOs sleeping from 7-7 and I‚Äôm quite frankly jealous! Any tips or advice would be much appreciated!

I've tried folding down the top lip at the back of the nappy in a feble attempt to hold the flood back, but its no match. 

I've tried going up a size, and pulling down the nappy to create room for the deposit, but thats also a hit and miss. 

And yes, I put the towel down in the seat as well, but lets be honest, half the time I forget, or I just put him in for a second while I nip to the bathroom to get a clean towel (if its not coming out the back door, its coming out the other end. Spit up, that is, not poo. That would be a whole other set of problems), or it just soaks right on through that as well.

Now to the part I'm struggling with most. When my oldest leaves his room at night he often refuses to go back in unless physically carried there. This is also a problem when he's sent to his room for a time out. I usually talk him through getting back in his room or, if he's being particularly stubborn and unsafe in his behavior, will carry him into his room and place him on the bed.

My husband has several times now solved the problem by pushing my son into his room and then closing the door. This usually involves a rough shove to the chest or shoulder which on several occasions has resulted in my son landing on his bottom in the room, after which my husband brusquely closes the door and leaves. In one instance my husband picked my son up and kind of tossed him onto the floor across the threshold and closed the door.

Anyway, is this like abuse-level concerning behavior? Has anyone resorted to this to get their child in their room?

Last night a friend got married and had an ""outdoor"" wedding and reception. When we first received the invitation, we were so excited. We have been social distancing pretty hard and haven't had many chances to see friends. When we received the invitation covid case levels were quite low and trending down. Well, that has changed, our state is surrounded by all of the hotspot states and trending to join them. My husband and I made the depressing and hard decision not to attend when we learned that the reception was to be held in a walled tent and mask wearing wasn't going be en vogue. 
My parents are high risk and part time caregiver for our 3 month old. We have a 2 1/2 year old as well who attends an extremely small home daycare that is very safe(Provider takes social distancing very seriously and there are only 3 other children besides her 2). So we have a close group of friends that have all had our kids at the same time. There are 8 toddlers and 5 new babies in the group. Most of us have been friends since Jr. High or earlier. Anyways, out of this large group of friends we were the only ones who thought it was risky enough to not attend. We would feel horrible if either of us were to catch the virus and sicken my parents or my children. If our toddler got sick and spread it to daycare, we would be beside ourselves. They all have young children and/or babies, elderly, high risk loved ones. Why are we the only ones?! I feel like I'm going crazy.  Am I being crazy? I don't know who to talk to about this. I don't want to judge but want to know why we are the only ones to feel this way. 

Also, our decision about the riskiness was confirmed by the snapchats we received. Crazy drunk dancing, no masks, no distance.(oh how I miss crazy drunk dancing:(   )

My bf (m32) and I (f29) have been together for 3 years. I have an 8 yr old son and he has a 12 yr old son, both from previous relationships. 

I am struggling immensely with building a bond with his son (let‚Äôs call him Jack). He is the complete opposite of my son (emotional, shy, quiet) and I am having the hardest time relating to him. I try so hard as a step parent to treat both boys the same, however, I do believe that since Jack is 4 years older, that he should have more responsibilities (for example: keeping track of his belongings, and doing slightly more chores - which in return he has a later bedtime, etc than my son). 

Since covid hit, he‚Äôs literally ONLY wanted to play video games, and complains constantly about having to do anything else. This obviously also has to do with his age, as he is about to turn 13. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point now where I feel like we are constantly bickering about what needs to be done and because he is so emotional, I will say something to him and he will start crying. Whether that be about getting his chores done, the rules around the house, etc. 

I‚Äôm worried that we don‚Äôt have any sort of activity/hobby that we could do together to help build a bond. Unfortunately I have a bad knee, so sports are out of the question. I‚Äôve played video games with him, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to help. I tried watching scary movies with him but he chooses to play video games with his dad because he doesn‚Äôt want to watch movies if his dad isn‚Äôt as well (but I want to find something that we can do just the two of us!)

My biological son and I have a very communicative and loving relationship, we are very close. So it makes me feel uncomfortable that I haven‚Äôt been able to build the same sort
of relationship with Jack, and makes me feel extremely guilty. I have to keep reminding myself that I‚Äôve only known Jack for 3 of his 12 years on earth and that bonding takes time. However, I feel like our relationship declining as time goes on.

I fear that during his teenage years he will end up resenting me and we won‚Äôt end up having any sort of relationship. I‚Äôve always tried to build up the love I have for him, but I am having the hardest time feeling like we have any sort of real bond. I‚Äôm worried that this will negatively affect the relationship I have with his father, as he‚Äôs mentioned a few times how great his last ex (not Jack‚Äôs mom) was with him when he was younger and how close they were (age 4-8). Jack even still called her step-mom when his dad and I got together, and he hadn‚Äôt seen her for over a year.

Does anyone have any suggestions about ways to build this relationship?

1) acknowledge their (non)problem right away and talk to them about it. This means actually listen to what is wrong in their little world and come up with a solution for it (if you do this step right, this is the end of the guide).

2) If you start too late or if it is too a big of an issue in their little heads, then you need to take them away from that environment and distract them with something else. They absolutely won't agree to it, but you have to gauge their level of saying ""no"" to see which offer is one they are actually sort of considering.

3) Once identified (ex: seeing cars out the window), you do the activity and actively engage them for a solid 5 - 10 minutes during it. They will almost certainly remember the tantrum at one point and start up again. You just double down in engaging them in the activity they agreed to do.

4) When a sense of normalcy seems to have resumed, then try to see if you can move away from them and see if they are still fine. If not, move back and continue as you were for another few minutes. Eventually, you'll be able to either: 
*(a) move away and leave them, be or at least 
*(b) offer them something else they refused earlier in their tantrum (i.e a snack) that they'll agree to.

5) If there was an underlying cause of the tantrum (hunger, sleep, etc), it can now be addressed. 

**Most important DO NOTs during the tantrum:**

* Do not yell at them or threaten them. Remain calm the entire time.
* Do not stop engaging them, even to deal with another kid (if it can be helped).
* Do not force a single solution on them or keep repeating one thing. You will need to be creative.
* Do not give up on trying to understand what they want.
* Do not stop dealing with the tantrum unless you are absolutely sure they are fine again.

My high school‚Äôs graduating class was around 400 kids or so. With respect to the state, we were‚Ä¶ average, when it came to academics. 

However, I was near the top of my class. I eventually attended The University of Texas (UT Austin, or simply ‚ÄúUT‚Äù), which allows a certain percentage of Texas high school graduating classes, automatic admission to the university (not to specific colleges within the university, such as business, engineering, etc., but just the university in general. Business, engineering, etc. had their own application processes). It‚Äôs now the top 6%, but was something like 8% when I was in school.

Back in high school, I had a friend who was on my club soccer team (not affiliated with school), who attended one of the best academic, most competitive schools in the entire state of Texas; not to mention that his graduating class was something like ~1,500 kids (and I thought *MY* graduating class of ~400 was considered big!)

And he was SMART; much smarter than I was. However, as smart as he was, and as hard as he tried (he worked his ass off), he still ended up in the top ~15% or so. And thus, when he applied to UT (also his dream school), he was waitlisted, because he was outside the top 8%. He ended up going to another university.

I guarantee you that, had my club soccer friend attended my high school, he would‚Äôve been our valedictorian, and would‚Äôve gotten into UT, no problem. And, had I gone to HIS high school, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten into UT.

This was a specific example, of course, but it got my wife and I thinking: we have a toddler, and we‚Äôre actively thinking about his future, especially when it comes to his education. We want to give him the best education possible, but also considering the atmospheres/environments of a fiercely academic-competitive school.

My son, almost four, recently came home with a class photo. There's about 15 other pre-schoolers in his class, so I started pointing to all of them, asking their names and if he's friends with them.

He told me most of their names, said he's friends with all of them- except for one girl, who happens to be the only non-white kid in his class. When I asked why they weren't friends, he said it's cause she's ugly. 

Not that it matters, obviously, but she's a really cute kid. Probably half white, half black, with a really well cared for natural afro. She's always clean and well dressed and super smile-y. 

Well, I gently told me son that that was a mean thing to say and that all boys are handsome and all girls are pretty and that you should only not be someone's friend if they're mean to you. He agreed the way toddlers do and just moved on with the conversation.

I'm at a loss. We don't have any black friends. We live in a VERY white town, in a white region, and I honestly don't think my son has ever seen a non-white person outside of restaurants and grocery stores. I know for a fact that this idea didn't come from myself or my partner or our parents, who watch him pretty often. I even try and make it a point to watch cartoons with him that feature all races and genders of protagonists.

Our parenting style has always been somewhat hands off, trying to teach our kids more resilience and independence. Kind of like if they fell over as young kids we would say 'come on up you get it's not too bad' (obviously not in all circumstances but I hope you all know what I mean). My brother and his wife have a different parenting style which is more (IMO) of the helicopter parent style.

&amp;#x200B;

We enjoy our time together as a family, and we love each other tremendously. But I can't help but notice that my 3 year old niece is seemingly extra spoilt and extremely pampered and pandered to. Maybe it's because we are past that stage and have 2 tweens with their own challenges now of wanting to be online, talk to friends, etc, that we've kind of forgotten what it's like to have a toddler, but its lately been causing some friction.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my 9 year old told me that she didn't really want to go play with her cousin because it was 'boring' and that she always 'told' to give her attention but she always snatches and cries when she doesn't get her way. I tried to tell my daughter that it's okay she's still little and learning how to share and that all babies are like that and it's part of learning. She accepted that but more than anything wants to spend time carrying and holding her 1 year old cousin. My 11 year old, plays a little then goes and sits on her own reading a book or watching tv, being a typical pre-teen.

  
This was fine until recently my brother and his wife started to express that my kids should be playing with their cousin and that they should be 'entertaining' her. I said to him that i'll encourage them to play but if they don't want to play they don't have to, the age gap is enough that it's probably going to be natural that the older kids want some space. It's usually about 30-45 minutes or so and then my kids kind of get bored of their little cousin.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my brother and his wife, and also my mother (their grandmother) have been telling them to stop doing whatever they are doing to go play with their cousin. ""stop reading and go play with your cousin"", ""stop carrying the baby and go play with your cousin"", ""go dress her up and brush her hair she really likes when you dress her up like a princess"" or when she's snatching it's ""oh give that to her she really wants it"" and multiple different variations. When my kids ignore these requests they turn to me or my wife ""hey make them go play with their cousin"" or ""geez your kids just want to sit around why even bother having them over if they won't even play with their cousin"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's at these times I simply turn to my kids and ask them ""hey girls do you want to play with your cousin?"" they know me and what I'm like and they say ""no dad we're okay"". And I'm like ""there you go, they're older that her and they've expressed that they are fine. If they want to play with her a little later they will, but i'm not going to force them."" This is usually met with grumbles and annoyance at my 'parenting'.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm kind of at a loss. I really enjoy my niece and always give her my attention whenever I can, but even I tire of it and quite frankly, it's because I've been through that and am glad we are at a different parenting stage. But the pressure is getting increasingly frustrating, and I'm kind of at a loss as to how to navigate this situation, because when i've tried to raise to my brother and his wife that they should expectation manage their child a little better it's met with almost an attitude of ""how are you going to judge us don't you know we are probably the greatest parents raising the most gorgeous and amazing child prodigy this world has ever seen?""

The mother passed away around 5 years ago and the boy has been in the foster care system ever since (possibly before as well as his mother was troubled). I am going to begin a process to find out information through official channels about where he is and try to arrange for a DNA test. If he is my child I will move heaven and earth to get him home with us and out of the foster care system. 

I do have a few concerns and questions/advice from people especially those who have been through it. 

I am worried about getting his hopes up and then me not being the father. I can only imagine what it will do to him so I‚Äôm not sure if I should try to do it anonymously or talk to him first. I also am not sure how he will react if I am the father and he needs to enter into a new family dynamic. I have been married 13 years (I met my wife after the ONS) and have 3 children (10, 6, 3).

I live in an area where it‚Äôs not uncommon for people to leave their houses and cars unlocked. I‚Äôm probably a little to relaxed about it to be fair.

My ex has custody of our toddler son for two days of the week while I work in a restaurant. I work all day both of those days and often stay at my bosses house (she lives next to the restaurant) in between those two days.

Yes your read right.

My house was an absolute mess and has been for weeks on end because the only child free time I have I work, so I‚Äôve let it get completely out of control and it‚Äôs been the cause of a lot of stress for me lately.

My ex thought it would be a nice surprise for me to come to a clean and tidy house so he came over and took care of it all. I was so simultaneously exhausted from work and grateful for the act of kindness that I proceeded to drop to the ground and ball sob for about 45 minutes.

My ex and I have been through some serious ups and downs and although we don‚Äôt always see eye to eye, he is a genuinely wonderful human and I couldn‚Äôt have picked anyone to co-parent with!!

My baby was born and I was kept from her for the first 20 hours because they had no rooms available. She was in the nursery and I was in the recovery area begging to see her.

To give some background..

We have a 1 and 3 year old and both work full time at this point.  I'm an RN and work 4 12s in a row with 5 days off and my husband is a high school teacher. The kids go Monday to Friday to daycare which leaves me with on average 2 or 3 days home with no kids (some of which I spend sleeping before a night shift)

Our regular points of contention are..

1. How to handle the nighttime when I get off a 12 hr shift because we are both exausted by bedtime.

2. How I should spend my days off with no kids. Should I be doing the majority of the housework because I have a couple days a week with no kids at home? Right now I spend the time doing a combination of housework, some hobby diy kinds of things and running. I feel like if I tried to get all the housework done on these days off then I wouldn't really have any time for myself

3. What's fair when it comes to my husband taking time on his own? We've mostly been working this in for an hour or so every night but it is definitely feeling like its not enough for him. I get pretty edgy when he lets it go too long and it seems like he is feeling like he deserves the time because I'm off without the kids during the week. The result is that I feel like I'm in this endless loop where Im supposed to do more housework because I get days off, but then also supposed to be paying him back for all this me time that I'm not getting.


So in general I'm just wondering if anyone out there relates to this situation and can give pointers on what worked for them. I'm also open to the possibility that 2 young kids with 2 working parents is going to be an overwhelming and exausting situation no matter how you swing it so I'd also be interested on tips to keep things friendly while negotiating even when at the end of the day you both just have to eat the shit sandwich",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2825519,public,self,Is dividing the labor supposed to be more exahausting than the labor itself?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/j8zzlq/is_dividing_the_labor_supposed_to_be_more/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

I‚Äôm a stay at home mom and with covid the only getting out I do is private walks or sometimes see my mom.

I'm 24 and have an older sister, who is 5 years apart from me and has already done college. And my home environment was not so desperate nor severe financially so that my sister decided to roll into college, though she had quite a hard time convincing my parents about it when she was 17, and I was 12. A few moments later after my sister moved over and started living herself, my mom always told me, who was 13 or 14, that ""your sister hadn't been in desire for college before, but then she started looking to it and finally asked me for college education, but I didn't want it because our financial stability was very weak, so if you also turn to the kind of thought, I would be not happy and have a harder time again."" (I, honestly, don't remember exactly what she was always griping, however, I still almost certainly feel guilty even now). That absolutely caused me not to consider attending college while many friends of mine in high school begun talking and thinking about it around me. I felt incredibly out and even got left behind at the moment, being in a circle of friends.

 Parents have a significant impact on their children and become the blueprint embedded in their perspective, behavior, values, or, seriously, everything else. Now I have to suffer and might be depressed and hopeless to some extent from the pressure of being required to have a degree, which later used to further our career. I know more people are getting optimistic about and don't care as much as about whether or not one has a college degree and yet society is reluctant to do so. Just because I'm aware of the fact that society is created by entities, not a single one, so if many more people jump at the idea, this would possibly become standard, only to find it healthy that a degree doesn't matter much, but I feel it doesn't occur anytime soon, at least within a period of time I could imagine.

 Looking back I've realized that I might've been manipulated by my mom griping about my sister's decision to get into college, which is generally a prevalent thought as a one -- a high school student -- who seeks after further advanced education, hoping for a decent job she could get later in her life being an adult. And I believe this is crazy because all parents are supposed to take responsibility for making sure that their children will be prepared to be a part of society and face less trouble when they need a job. How could my mom discourage me not to get into college? Why would she not allow me to have the opportunity while she had an associate degree?

 Is it weird that parents deter their kids from college or could this be just neglect?

The situation is confusing as his father and I are technically still married as our divorce has been taking longer than expected due to covid, then due to us not coming to a custody agreement. Basically, his dad has been in and out of jail for most of his life, and when he wasn't locked up he was intoxicated. He was eventually sent to prison for over a year and released when the pandemic began as he is not considered a violent offender. The point I'm trying to make here is that my son hasn't really spent much time around his father; he recognizes him in pictures but very rarely asks about him and doesn't seem much bother by his absence as he really doesn't know any different. When his father was released from prison, he moved to a different state to live with some girl he met online and her kids. He told me flat out that unless he is able to have our son stay with him occasionally he wouldn't help with any money for childcare, clothing, etc (though I did already file for child support which has gotten nowhere thus far). I am not comfortable with anything other than supervised visits as he has a history of erratic behavior (took off on foot in the middle of winter carrying our infant son, throwing a knife while our son was in the room, both of which law enforcement was involved) and he is an alcoholic that was arrested as recently as last week for public intoxication. 

He told me he would give up his parental rights if I wouldn't ask for money. I told him I would consider supervised visits but was not comfortable with any other arrangements. I want to do what is best for my son and I am really struggling here. I want my son to have a relationship with his father, but I worry that it would be more confusing/harmful to him than it would be beneficial.

He whined about it because he didn‚Äôt want to be in the car. We had spent about two hours at a flea market earlier so now he just wanted to ‚Äúwatch some YouTube‚Äù. Except he watched YouTube for hours this morning. And we had to drag him away for the flea market too. He wouldn‚Äôt have gone if I didn‚Äôt demand it.

When he got to the spot for the picture I literally wanted him to smile for thirty seconds so I could take a couple of shots and leave. Kid looked like he was going to cry the whole damn time!!! I was so mad. I told him he better knock it off because this is for grandpa so get it together or you‚Äôll never see your iPad again. Yeah, a little harsh, I know. 

I AM OVER IT. I have created a monster. It is 100% my fault. He got an amazon kindle at age 5 from his grandmother. I never took it away from him. I can make excuses all I want but I know I just needed a babysitter so I could clean, cook, and recover from my late husband‚Äôs sudden death. I let it become his pacifier.

He‚Äôs got legos, art supplies, numerous board games, cards, books, etc here but refuses to use any of them when he doesn‚Äôt have access to his device (it already gets shut off at 7pm, obviously not early enough). He just says he‚Äôs bored. I play cards/games with him but he makes it halfway through a game before he‚Äôs ‚Äúbored‚Äù. Should I just let him be bored and figure it out? I‚Äôm going to look around and get him some craft or stem kits that he can work on as well, and when band starts he will need to spend some time practicing his instrument. But other than that...

Let me just note that I will be spending less time on my phone/tablet as well, as I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to demand it of him while not following myself.

My 2 year old daughter likes to watch videos on YouTube of baby dolls, peppa pig etc..

I have YouTube kids set up on my phone and let her watch them once in a while, it is set up for videos for 3 years and under. She is pretty good at navigating it.

Yesterday morning she was having cereal and watching her videos on my phone, I was making coffee when she started screaming. I knew it was a scared cry. I ran over and took the phone and picked her up. She was trembling. After I calmed her down I went and looked at the video she was watching. It was basically a little girl maybe 5 or 6 sitting on a couch playing with her cat when a green hand comes out from under the couch and takes the cat, the camera then shows underneath the couch and we see a pair of glowing red eyes. That is where I had stopped the video when she started screaming.

She is ok now but she will not step foot near the couch nor living room and its been 2 days. She was always on the couch, all her toys are in the living room. She hangs out in the kitchen. If I try to carry her to the couch and sit with her she takes a fit. She keeps saying ""No couch, No couch.

I have tried everything I can think of, I even lifted the couch off the floor to show her that there is nothing, she smiled but still won't go near it.

This was originally about starting the process of speaking to my son from my present into his future by starting a blog of letters and pictures to him. I veered pretty far from that original intention. I admit this is mostly for me, but I think including anonymous strangers is a good start in the beginning stages of being open about my life and recent failures. I don‚Äôt provide any details of my crime or state, so I understand some may read this as a rant against the ‚Äúunfairness‚Äù experienced by a convicted criminal. That isn‚Äôt what this is. Even if it may not be fully apparent in some parts of the body of my post, I do take full responsibility for all the events that led to me losing the rights to my son. Whether they were actions taken or not taken by me or by others, none of them would have taken place had I not committed my crime. I‚Äôve been wanting an outlet to tell my story, even if it‚Äôs bits and pieces at a time, in order to in some way unburden myself by taking responsibility for the terrible heartache I‚Äôve caused those I love and the difficulties involved in rebuilding my life. So, I guess I‚Äôll leave this as is for now and address my original thought in a different post some other time. Talking and writing about these things‚Äîespecially my son‚Äîis cathartic and keeps my focus on being the best father I can be from a distance and whenever the time for our reunion comes. If you do read through this and have any questions, please ask...I love talking about him.

 

I haven‚Äôt had custody of my son since he was two and half years old. He was (and still is) my everything, my sonshine, and the light of my life. It wasn‚Äôt always like this; for up until two years after being charged with my misdemeanor my wife would‚Äîsporadically, and often with a quid pro quo attached‚Äîallow him and I to FaceTime and talk on the phone. Earlier on in the process she even facilitated personal visits when myself or my parents and I made the 9 hour trip for court hearings. That access she provided changed as time dragged on. She understandably became more incensed with how long things were taking to reach a disposition and was evermore frustrated by my unwillingness to do what she wanted me to do (which might have concluded things earlier, but also prolong the length of my sentence). Every inconvenience was the result of my action or inaction (and that‚Äôs true in hindsight‚ÄîI was the one who committed the crime), but I was determined to follow the advice of my attorneys to a T, believing it would be best for all of us if my sentence was as short as possible. One day a few months before I agreed to a fair plea deal, my wife called me, calmly, and we had a good two-hour conversation‚Äîsomething we hadn‚Äôt had since I was arrested. At the end she told me her lawyer was advising her not to communicate with me anymore, as it could adversely affect her image in family court proceedings. I told her it‚Äôd be tough not being able to talk to our son, but I understood she was doing everything she could to mitigate his confusion and heartache due to my absence, and that in a couple month‚Äôs time we could start again. That was the last time I‚Äôve ever talked to her. I waited patiently for a month and a half, then started texting her, then emailing her, asking for just a little update on where things were. Multiple messages were sent and one week she‚Äôd respond, ‚ÄúHe is fine. He is happy. Stop asking.‚Äù A couple more weeks would pass with nothing and I‚Äôd start the cycle of ramping up my messaging to her again. Soon, instead of getting cold reassurances that mitigated my worry, I began to get threats: ‚ÄúDo not contact me again or I will make sure you will never see your son.‚Äù It was so unexpected. So contrary to her words in the past, in which she promised she would never keep him from me. The threat accompanied by the lack of constructive communication exacerbated a lot of things: my fears, my loneliness, my anxiety, my depression. I wasn‚Äôt able to think rationally so I came to the conclusion that the threat was just a thoughtless outburst at being annoyed. So, every couple weeks I‚Äôd send another desperate series of emails or text messages. I was never rude, spiteful, or threatening; I begged, then bargained, then became matter-of-fact and tried to appeal to her sense of reason, then tried to open negotiations through third parties for some semblance of assurance my son would not be withheld.

 

None of that worked. And since that final phone call in December 2018, my son‚Äôs mom has completely shut down communication with me, his incredibly loving grandparents (my mom and dad), and pretty much my side of his entire family. My son didn‚Äôt deserve any of this; but especially the loss of his grandparents. They were always so supportive of his mom and did everything they could during that terrible three years after my arrest to try to be present for her, even making the 9 hour trip once a month to watch the kids and give her some time to herself. Their support of me and my son maintaining a relationship wore her thin, though, and soon she began distancing herself from them in the same manner she did with me. I want to blame this on something wrong were psychology: borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, whatever. I want to believe this is an overreaction caused by the trauma of the abuse she experienced by her ex and her mom, but I know it‚Äôs best that I don‚Äôt do those things. My son can decide to have ill will toward either of us, but I‚Äôm not going to bias that decision with my perception that his mom acted against his interests. I mean, **that‚Äôs** his home now. **That‚Äôs** his life. He has a mom he loves and lives with and a dad who went to prison who he doesn‚Äôt live with or see anymore. For all my anger and distrust toward her, I know she loves him and will keep him safe and *will be there to help mend his heartache as he grows and every now and then remembers the day he went to daycare with his daddy kissing him on the forehead and waving him goodbye, then coming home to find that his daddy is gone day after day, week after week, month after month, and now year after year.*

 

Overall, it‚Äôs been three and half years since him and I were under the same roof, three years since I‚Äôve seen him, and two years since we‚Äôve spoken. I fought for him as best as I could while incarcerated but ultimately lost custody. It was unexpected, as research shows that a misdemeanor conviction in my state would not have normally been satisfactory enough to warrant a termination of parental rights. But, with my wife‚Äôs neutrality about the state‚Äôs motion to terminate and her slowly-developed unwillingness to advocate on my behalf (at her attorney‚Äôs advice, for fear of giving the appearance of complicity in my dealings), the state succeeded, and my appeal fell on deaf ears due to my explanation during testimony for not seeking a resolution for all legal matters sooner (ie. ‚ÄúProlonging the familial separation.‚Äù). It had been two years at that time.


But I‚Äôm getting too far away from what‚Äôs actually important here: my boy. I miss him. I miss experiencing his sweetness, his curiosity, his imagination, and his love. I miss teaching him things and showing him things under my microscope. I miss playing cars. I missed his potty training. I missed his last day with a diaper and his last day with a pacifier. I missed his third, fourth, and fifth birthdays, and I‚Äôm going to miss his sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth without an act of God. All I can do is think of him every day‚Äîand I do‚ÄîI imagine him at pre-school and starting kindergarten (after COVID), wonder what things he likes, wonder if he‚Äôs still saying his R‚Äôs like L‚Äôs; I keep struggling to come to terms with the fact he‚Äôs the same person he was three and a half years ago but is certainly so different now than how I knew him, and I hope his mom‚Äîwhen/if she wants to‚Äîfinds a man who will be a better father figure to him than I am (was?). He is radiant in every aspect of his being and he still deserves all the happiness he deserved when I first held him in my arms and felt a love I didn‚Äôt know was possible.

 

One of the first times my ex-wife and I stayed with each other happened three months after my arrest (I had bonded out of jail quickly). We met at a hotel I was staying at and our little boy was with us. We went to the hotel room (just FYI, any and all pretense of intimacy or romance had begun to whither at this point), and sat across from each other on the two hotel beds. Our son was so happy, so jovial, so smiley to see us three together again. But something must have felt amiss to him‚Äîmommy and daddy didn‚Äôt hug or kiss; they aren‚Äôt sitting next to each other; they haven‚Äôt touched, and they‚Äôve smiled at me but they haven‚Äôt smiled at one another. Our two and a half year old walked up to his daddy, looked him in the eye, grabbed his hand and pulled it as a signal to get up off the bed.


I obliged, not knowing what he was doing but it seemed adventurous.


He pulled my hand toward his mommy and motioned for me to sit down beside her. Then he grabbed his mommy‚Äôs hand and placed our two hands together. For the first time ever, it was awkward to hold my wife‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúHold tight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLove you mommy, love you daddy.‚Äù Then walked to the window to watch the rain fall.

I‚Äôm coming here for advice, so please correct me and tell me how to move in the right direction. 

We have a 7 year old boy in foster care (also his 6 and 1.5 yo brothers) and he wets the bed nearly every night. We had a heads up on that and have a bed protector on the mattress, so it‚Äôs not that big of a deal, but doing sheets every day sucks and it sucks for him to wake up covered in pee every day. 

We always try our best to be positive and have talked about wanting to help him learn to not have accidents at night. We have also gotten him nighttime underwear (big pull-ups) and a bed wetting alarm (sensor detects bed wetting and wakes him up to go to the bathroom). These worked great for a child we had before that was in the same situation, but we went about it slower with him since we didn‚Äôt really know about the options then. 

When talking to him before giving him both the nighttime underwear and alarm, he was supportive of using them to help. After the first night of each though, he has become very resistant to wearing either one. We make sure to only refer to the underwear as ‚Äúnighttime underwear‚Äù, but he calls them diapers and doesn‚Äôt want to wear diapers. With the alarm, he says it scares him and insists he doesn‚Äôt need it (he needs something). We tried a star chart for wearing the alarm and making it through the night (silver for wearing it and gold for making it through the night dry) with rewards for streaks of each. He was excited about that the first day but quickly lost motivation in that at all. 

There is definitely some trauma associated with bed wetting for him though. He said his mom would spank him for wetting the bed and that she never really did anything else for it. 

We may have moved too fast with trying to help the bed wetting, but that‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm wondering about. I‚Äôm also looking for advice on how to encourage use of the nighttime underwear and/or the alarm, or other methods people have used and found helpful. 

One other thing I have tried is waking him up to go to the bathroom a few hours after he has gone to sleep. I tried that one night and he refused to get out of bed and I had no way to get him to go so I just left him be (and he later wet the bed).",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2824766,public,self,Healthy ways to help bed wetting?

That being said, it was my hope to exclusively breastfeed my son. But I ended up with a retained placenta (for nearly a month) and it completely screwed over my milk supply.

Even so, I‚Äôm heartbroken. 

A friend of mine who has a 6 month old recently offered to donate some of her milk to us so that my son would have more breastmilk. It‚Äôs such an incredibly generous gesture, one that I find really humbling. Humbling in the sense that I have been blessed with wonderful friends, but also humbling in an almost humiliating way. I should be able to give enough to my son and I can‚Äôt. My body isn‚Äôt sufficient.

So... mamas that weren‚Äôt able to breastfeed the way that you wanted to or weren‚Äôt able to at all, how did you get over it? *Did* you get over it? It‚Äôs like a cloud over me. 

And please. To those that think I‚Äôm being melodramatic or are somehow overreacting for feeling the way that I do... please keep your thoughts to yourself.

My family and I have lived in our house a little over a year.  One big motivation for choosing our neighborhood was the zoned schools. 

Yesterday we learned the school board is considering rezoning our area to a school we would be unhappy with because of a new elementary opening. 

I'm planning on emailing and attending the community meetings scheduled.  

Does anyone have any advice on persuading the school board otherwise/ avoiding this?

There are a few hurdles I have. The first one is that he does not talk, not just to me, but in general. The second hurdle is that it is hard to grab his attention. For example, he will zone out at the tv and be irresponsive. I can‚Äôt turn off the tv because a roommate of theirs sits in the living room all day.

We also play in the sand box. So far- this is the most interaction I can get out of him. I‚Äôve been telling him the names and color of objects throughout the day (for example a blue ball). I got him to say the word shoe and he pointed to his foot.

How little did I know about postpartum depression, the effects of sleep deprivation, what a merciless testing ground motherhood really is...

Meanwhile, I'm frustrated pretty often. Tiredness can sometimes be so strong that my whole body hurts. I have been powerless so many times - during a nasty labor, during painful lactation problems, during many nights when my son just can't sleep, during various parental dilemmas for which there is no single/good answer, so all I can do is to follow my intuition and hope that nothing bad comes out of it. Etc.

Don't get me wrong, I love my son very much. I enjoy spending time with him and watching him grow. I love his smile in the morning and how he calms down in my arms. My whole family thinks I'm doing very well and have a wonderful relationship with my son - which is true, for most of the time. 

But I often wonder: how much does it really take to emotionally mutilate your child? Sometimes during sleepless nights, when various contradictory emotions multiply in my head, I look into his wide open eyes and wonder: how well he read my emotions and how much they hurt him? How much of it will stay with him forever?

Basically it started with him slapping my butt. Then he started humping me saying ‚ÄúOhhhh (my name) you‚Äôre so beautiful you‚Äôre my girlfriend ohhhh‚Äù which was SUPER uncomfortable.

His dad and I tell him over and over not to do that to people. For example I will tell him that it‚Äôs not right and to respect people‚Äôs space and bodies. We shut it down immediately.

When I was a child, she was always extremely critical, criticising everything about me, my appearance, being overweight, the way I chose to do my hair, the roll of the eyes when I spoke passionately about something I wanted to do, the ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô look when I failed at something. 
From the ages of 9 to about 14, I would get violently beaten when I refused to do something I was told to do, or for asking ‚Äòwhy‚Äô too many times. She never did the beating, she would wait until a certain family member got home, tell them that I had been bad, push me into their room &amp; then she would leave the room, closing the door behind her. I would cry out for her, she never had sympathy, she never came. Once the beating was over I was exhausted, in pain and wanted to be alone. But I was made to wash my face and sit at the dinner table with the wider family, pretend like nothing had happened. Slowly, I stopped screaming, crying, or moving during the beatings, I built resilience, and I remember hating her for it. As I grew up, she apologised for this on one occasion, and I accepted the apology and put it behind me. I‚Äôve tried to work on our relationship but it‚Äôs really difficult, we are opposite personalities. She is outgoing and social, I am more introverted and shy, she values appearance and tradition, I value knowledge and don‚Äôt value tradition. 

I always got the impression that she cared more about how she was perceived by the community than she did about me. We have had authentic mother daughter moments, the relationship isn‚Äôt completely devoid of love, but it usually takes something big, like me being sick, for her to be nurturing or loving towards me. I know it‚Äôs exclusive to me, because she has more of a nurturing, caring, ‚Äòmotherly‚Äô relationship with my siblings and has always got on with them fine. 

I‚Äôm an adult now, and we still get into arguments easily, so I try to keep my distance. I feel that no matter what I do it‚Äôs not enough, she minimises everything I do. It‚Äôs so strange, I know that she loves me, I‚Äôm her first born, I love her deeply. But I never feel more small, unworthy, or unaccomplished in life than when I‚Äôm in the presence of my mother. I don‚Äôt actually know what it‚Äôs like to have a mother that you can talk to about your troubles in life, she‚Äôs never the person I think of calling when something is wrong, because I know she will only make me feel worse, without even trying. 

For those of you who have adult daughters, or maybe you are an adult daughter, have you had any experience of a mother/daughter relationship like this?

First up, getting the 4T out of storage. Everything washed, dried, and hung up, only to find out the 3.5 year old actually skipped 4T and went straight to 5T :(

Next, the newborn decided it was good to just be in 6m clothing even though he's 7 weeks old! I had just brought out the 0-3 month, but put the back and got out the 6m instead. I had also just bought a shitton of size 1 diapers, as he JUST sized into them. They don't fit. Returned to target for size 2s.

While contemplating the size 1s to size 2s, realized the 2 year old could probably benefit from size 5s instead. Bought a few boxes, one for daycare, two for home.

Got the 24M/2T stuff out for the 2 year old. Washed, dried, put away. It fits well for a week or so, then realize his little toes are all scrunched up in sleepers. Time to put those away, and get out 3T.

Nothing in her diet has changed, no differences for routine etc either. Only thing different was she had her flu nasal spray a few days before this started, but as said it was two weeks ago so didn't think that would still be causing an issue if there was one. 

In every other aspect she's her normal self, no other changes other than the poop.

When we can‚Äôt determine what he wants he starts to get frustrated (for god reason!). When we say ‚Äúno‚Äù to something he wants (candy, tablet, etc.) or wants to do (play when it‚Äôs time to leave) he throws some big, long temper tantrums and he looks for the closest things to throw/push over/make a mess of and he‚Äôs inconsolable for a good 10-15 minutes.

Parents of Reddit,.how did you know your kids were sufficiently mature to start developing computer skills beyond some tablet games? What skills did you focus on?

Background:

I have a 4 young children, 6, 4 and 1 year old twins. My oldest daughter is a veracious reader, consuming chapter books well above her level, asking me questions that challenge my understanding of the physical world, and she absorbs and retains EVERYTHING. Lately, she's becoming very interested in computers.

I see the value in immersing her in computers at an early age. Computers and programming permeate most skillets these days, and having literacy will make it easier to focus on more important things. 

BUT..

She tends to obsess over electronics, tv, desserts, or really anything that she loves whenever it becomes a regular thing (talks about it constantly, asks when she can, why she can't now, enjoys other things less because she's so focused on the fact that she isn't doing that)

Her current exposure, she's using tablets for games 1-2 hours a week, watching tv 1-2 hours per week, and sometimes uses tablets at school for group participation activities (smart board integrated).

He swims without assistive devices (with supervision). He drinks from a standard glass. He dresses himself (shirt and pants only). He walks around two to three miles daily between walking to the pool, walking to a corner shop for a snack. He climbs fearlessly, can carry a half gallon of milk, and the idea that he cannot even bring his hands to midline and has disabling muscle weakness is just strange. I made sure she was speaking about my son, and yes, she was. She demanded she stay at least as consult during the IEP because ""he is so limited he will definitely need help still by kindergarten."" I agree he needs help plus practice with his pre-writing skills, but frankly, what she was suggesting about my son implies a severe intellectual disability/brain injury.

I am not sure she is aware I am in healthcare, but it is pretty obvious to anyone who is and who has met and assessed my son she is lying. (He switched schools this year, and she works for the district. Many people have not met him.) There is no plausible reason she would believe anything she said. Last year, he became very distressed and would no longer go to school without crying some months after beginning to work with her. I did not attribute this to her, but based on her stories yesterday of his non-compliance (which 100% sounds like him by the description), I am now wondering. 

She is consult only and will not be seeing him, but was to speak to us last month and just didn't reach out. I also didn't reach out to her, mostly because I'm not worried and think his teacher and other therapist are doing a good job of working on his pre-writing skills as much as they can with COVID19. I find her insistence he is both profoundly disabled and that she MUST see my child when he starts kindergarten, because he is SO limited, so strange when it doesn't align with everyone else's. She seems very pushy about seeing my son alone and otherwise disinterested. I worry I am overreacting, but I really don't want her alone with him, but am unsure how to articulate my fear or even sure exactly what my fear is.

TL;DR: Therapist insists my child is profoundly disabled and only interested in unsupervised time with him. No one else (general pediatrics, developmental pediatrics, teacher, SLP, family, friends) seems to agree.

We give our kids one chore per each year of their age. For example if you are 10 you have 10 chores.  We call them duties instead of chores however, because it includes reading and homework.  I tell my kids of they finish all of their duties on the weekend they are free to watch 
  tv, or play games as long as they want.  Usually for my kids they tend to take a long time. Mostly from tantrums and being plan lazy. But the last 3 weekends my son(9 ) has been finishing his duties hours ahead of everyone. And I couldn‚Äôt figure out how.
It turns out he multitask. For example 3 of his duties are to ‚Äúwalk the dog, read or listen  3 chapters of a book, take out the trash‚Äù. Well he takes the trash out when he walks the dog, he also listens to an audiobook. Something that used to take him 2 hours takes 30 mins. 
Also he must do his homework and study. He sets an alarm for 5:30am. Does his homework and studies until about 6:30. Then goes back to bed until 8.

By the time it‚Äôs 11am he‚Äôs done with all of his duties and the other kids are just waking up.  I check his work. Every duty is done correctly, so I can‚Äôt complain. But I feel like he‚Äôs cheating the system. 
My husband and I were thinking about giving him a few bonus task just to make things fair. But it might be a ‚Äújerk‚Äù move.

2. Literally yesterday he told me I was gaining weight.

3. He found out my Coach likes the Baltimore Ravens and not only bought me a jersey for me to wear around him, but was prepared to drive 3 and 1/2 hours to bring it to me. He hasn‚Äôt visited me all school year though because ‚Äúit‚Äôs too far of a drive‚Äù

4. In high school we wore our jerseys to school on game days and when I would come downstairs to leave without it on, he would say ‚Äúare you putting it on at school‚Äù but would forget to say ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù or ‚Äúhave a good day‚Äù 

5. I‚Äôm a digital media major and when I was showing him a video I made that I was proud of, he was on his phone the whole time and when it finished he said ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs done, can we watch the scrimmage film now?‚Äù

I‚Äôll spare the enormous story and sum it up with this. Mom and I split in oct 2018. Filed for divorce in Jan 2019 after figuring it out that we just weren‚Äôt going to work. We had her son, 9 we will call B, who I lost custody of because of the toxic things she would say. The relationship appeared to be so damaged the court appointed family investigator stated that basically it would take years of counseling and supervised visits to repair that relationship despite me being the psychological father and having been there since he was 4 or 5 mo. The cost to do this was astronomical and I had to admit defeat. (We didn‚Äôt adopt because mom didn‚Äôt want to notify biological father B existed).

The other two are a 7 yo girl, A. And then my youngest  2 1/2 yo, R.

B is diagnosed low functioning autistic. He could communicate but had violent tendencies and last year he was also diagnosed with adhd.

A is in second grade and the relationship between mom and her is clearly more friend than daughter. They get on the phone and gossip every night she visits with me. Basically A just tells mom anything negative that happens at my house.

Then there is R. He is struggling. He isn‚Äôt speaking at all. He bables constantly, he isn‚Äôt potty trained or training. He literally cannot drink out of a cup. He won‚Äôt try to use utensils. He can‚Äôt walk up or down stairs only if he crawls. I have three step kids and a biological son with my SO now and he can‚Äôt function with them. They will take a toy from him and he just sits and quietly cries. We correct the action and then he finds either me or my SO and just won‚Äôt engage with them.

If I call to my SO or to A when I‚Äôm in another room I hear him shout and cry.

So against my better judgement I used some of my lessons learned about interviewing juveniles at my job and in a very indirect and non confrontational way I asked some non leading questions to my daughter.

Basically A tells me, R is put in his bedroom at night. He is yelled at if he goes to the baby gate in his doorway and cries. B used to hit him and take his toys but I guess that stopped. R isn‚Äôt allowed out of the room in the morning until mom gets him and she sometimes sleeps in. Nobody really plays with R very much and they ask A to do a lot of stuff for R. Things parents do, fetch him his sippy with milk, watch him when adults leave the room, keep him entertained when he is over upset. (I had realized this was becoming a problem when she was trying to dictate what food I was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to feed her brother).

Mom swears R is autistic as well but I don‚Äôt see it. R doesn‚Äôt respond to wieghted items. He doesn‚Äôt have that obsession for feeling certain textures. He doesn‚Äôt have a problem with being touched or even loud noises. He doesn‚Äôt self harm or have meltdowns of any sort. He doesn‚Äôt have that thing like his brother did where he would have to do something repeatedly(B would stab the same food item on his plate a couple times, if he didn‚Äôt get it right he would get mad and have a moment.) his eye contact is pretty good and he can do some things after you work with him for a solid moment. Like drinking out of a container or cup.

I‚Äôm extremely concerned that mom is creating this lack of development. He doesn‚Äôt attend daycare. Mom resides with her dad and brother and they watch the kids to avoid high daycare costs. They don‚Äôt socialize R with other kids at all. And I feel like he is so far behind. I get three days every two weeks and that just isn‚Äôt enough time to work with him. I‚Äôm so concerned that he is basically be left behind developmentally because everyone at moms house things he‚Äôs autistic so ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way he is‚Äù.

What do it do?!? I‚Äôm not a doctor but I have enough experience and training in my job to recognize some of the signs or identifiers of autism.

I used to think he had an issue with sound but I soon realized it‚Äôs only yelling and A said they yell at him for crying all the time. He bursts into tears and I tell him it‚Äôs ok and he stops audibly crying and begging to just quietly sob to himself. My heart is torn for my son. He seems so miserable and sad.

Is this something Maybe social services would look at? I fought for two years in court(that‚Äôs another post later for sure) but save to say, she didn‚Äôt take him to visits appointed by the judge, she wasn‚Äôt allowing communication with my kids, she didn‚Äôt show up to a pickup once and I had to take the kids the four hour drive back to my home and then I got into trouble for keeping them. But the judge granted her primary custody. And the parenting orders are set now, they were temporary since aug 2019 because of Covid.

I‚Äôll wrap this up sorry for the lengthy read.

Listen to them scream or cry. Prepare bottles. Clean and sterilize the bottles. Breast feed or pump. Buy formula. Burp them. Buy nappies. Read to them. Sing to them. Watch childrens shows/movies over and over again. Bathe them daily. Get up during the night for feeds and nappy changes. Dress them. Do their washing. Clean up toys and make their beds.

Everyone had a lot of fun reading the reports and stuff and both my bonus babes (7 &amp; 9) asked for one as well. 

The results came back and they are marked as half siblings. 

I told my husband, he didn't react much, and now he just says he doesn't want to discuss it. Which, I 100% understand. He did mention he'd always questioned if the oldest was his, but I think it's the younger one. My husband will not do a 23&amp;me test so we're not sure which, if either, he is the bio dad to. 

In one sense, this changes nothing. I love them just as much as any kiddo who happened to come out of me. But, I cannot get it off my brain. I am so mad at their mother for hiding this for so long. She was always with other men and she is a sex worker. (That I am fine with, just more annoyed she didn't prepare everyone for this.)

I will obviously not spill the beans on this but I don't feel it's right for us to wait on it too long. I've read that it's best children learn while younger. 

There's also the fear that BM will use this in court. We have 50/50, week on week off, but BM dips out a lot. Currently, we've had them the past 4 weeks and this upcoming Sunday starts our week so it'll be five if she picks them up for her following week. 

The other thing... what about this man (these men?) out there who may not know they have a child?! Before my husband ended the conversation on it, he said that maybe they're just a good guy. I know I would never stand in the way of them getting another parent to love them and I believe my husband would agree.

I (33M) am never hit by our little girl (almost 2). But she often hits my wife/ her mom (33).

My wife doesnt have as harsh a response and feels bad if the little one gets sad after reprimand. Is this why she hits mom? Should we be consistent here?

Little one also knows it's bad, if I'm in sight of her, she may not hit, even makes a lackluster motion of hitting mom while looking at me.

Please feel free to keep on scrolling if you don‚Äôt want to read a pitiful story of how I feel unworthy.*

My little one is 11 months old, so needless to say most of his life has been spent in quarantine. He had just gotten his 4 month vaccinations when ‚Äúlock down‚Äù went into effect, so he‚Äôs never really known anything but staying home. I know he‚Äôs young enough to not be negatively affected by the lack of socialization, but here‚Äôs my issue...

I absolutely hate being a stay at home mom. I have never intended to be a stay at home mom. I worked very hard to achieve a clinical doctorate and even completed a post-doctoral residency program and passed a board specialty exam in my field. I had just returned to work on a ‚ÄúPRN‚Äù (as needed) basis when CoVID hit and my employer decided to no longer utilize PRN employees. Prior to CoVID I had ample opportunity to work, often times getting a full 40 hours per week. I understand the need to cut costs and when patient numbers are down, PRNs aren‚Äôt needed, so here I am, a SAHM while my husband works from home. I suck at ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù duties and feel generally useless and unworthy. We used to have someone clean our home every other week (and she was going to nanny for our son while I worked), but now we can‚Äôt afford her services. 

I‚Äôm not good at playing with my son. I sit in his play pen we have set up (to keep him safe when I need to run to the other room or to prepare his food, etc.) and just count down the minutes until he gets bored so we can do something else. I try to do ‚Äúdevelopmentally appropriate‚Äù activities with him but they‚Äôre usually a bust. He won‚Äôt sit still long enough for me to read to him (understandable) and would rather pull my hair and poke me in the eye. I constantly wish time to go faster so that the day is over and he can go to bed. I HATE that I‚Äôm thinking this way because I know he‚Äôs only going to be this young once. I feel like I don‚Äôt have that loving ‚Äúmother-son‚Äù bond with him and I don‚Äôt know how to make it better. 

This whole week my husband has pretty much taken on all parental duties while also working his full time job because I‚Äôm just at an all-time low. I desperately want a break. I‚Äôve never been away from little one for more than a few hours since he‚Äôs been born. Husband and I haven‚Äôt had a date since LO arrived. Our relationship is really struggling because of our lack of connection. He has difficulty adhering to a ‚Äúschedule‚Äù now that he‚Äôs WFH and I go to bed while he‚Äôs still working. I think part of the problem is that he refuses to set up his office in the spare bedroom and works from the dining room... which is also open to our kitchen and living room, which is where I am with LO the entire day. My husband is extremely supportive, but I don‚Äôt feel like I can ask him for anything else because he does so much already and I basically contribute nothing. 

We don‚Äôt have any family in the area to give us respite (and when I‚Äôve even mentioned to my mom how frustrated I am I get a ‚Äúyeah‚Äù or ‚Äúyour child will probably have a lot of social and developmental issues because of this‚Äù). We also don‚Äôt have any type of ‚Äúsupport system‚Äù comprised of neighbors or friends that we could trust to watch LO for even a few hours. Nobody in our area takes CoVID very seriously and I just don‚Äôt feel right possibly exposing LO due to the unknown long term effects of the disease. 

We‚Äôve tried to do some socially-distant outside things like going to the zoo, but I felt so uncomfortable because lots of people weren‚Äôt wearing masks (even though they are mandated). At our local neighborhood park people don‚Äôt respect social distancing guidelines and on more than one occasion a mom has come up to my stroller and poked her head in to ogle my son. It‚Äôs so frustrating and I feel trapped in my house.

I have a wonderful, kind, empathetic child who I have the absolute privilege of homeschooling this year. It‚Äôs actually more of a hybrid program, there is a certified teacher who makes the lesson plans &amp; my child is with a small group of students in a classroom two days a week. I carry out the lesson plans at home the other three days.

We are entering first grade and I‚Äôm thinking that she may be of average intelligence. I haven‚Äôt really experienced this, even as a speech language pathologist. Children, in my experience, either have some kind of learning disability, are severe special needs, or are gifted. Sometimes, I feel that students could be of above average intelligence but may be in the wrong environment that is not conducive for learning, i. e. little parental involvement, food scarcity, homelessness etc. My child doesn‚Äôt fit any of those prerequisites. She just seems...average?

Anyway, in teaching my daughter at home and while she‚Äôs at school, it seems like she has trouble picking up on topics in math and language, even after they have been taught multiple times. It takes her a while to get organized (executive function issues?) She needs you to repeat directions at least 3 to 4 times, sometimes still missing the point‚Äîlike with word problems. Memorization for sight words and basic word facts is not coming easy and she shows little retention. She cannot read instructions and follow them independently, which I do recognize at somewhat normal for first grade. Reading an age-appropriate passage (assigned by her teacher) takes one hour, with little comprehension. I am planning on talking with her teacher but of course won‚Äôt bother her over the weekend.

I‚Äôm looking for assurance and next steps. Do we get her intelligence tested? If she has a learning disability it isn‚Äôt super apparent. Where do we go from here? I‚Äôm happy with her as a person‚Äîshe‚Äôs a joy to have and I love her deeply.

Again like many households, it started innocently enough with our first child in middle school with lots of oversight, rules and monitoring.  However, as time moved on and the perception of responsibility and maturity took over, we paid less and less attention to our oldest as our younger 2 boys required more time.

Enter snapchat.  We really had no clue just how devious this app was.  I understood the basics behind it.  Chat, send pics and vids, and everything is deleted.   I wasnt super worried about the social aspects of this for my kid as he is smart, does good in school, has lots of extracurriculars, and all in all is pretty well rounded.  To be honest, I was no angel at 16 and I do realize that kids grow up...16 years old and this is how the teenagers communicate, whats the worse that can happen...Boobs and d1ck pics?    My wife and I have always tried to be open, honest, and informative when it comes to discussing sexual relationships but in the end it is up to them to make and be accountable for their decisions.  All that being said...there was 1 thing I overlooked....the DRUGS!!!  

I had no idea...and not to spoil the ending here...but I think we caught this in time.   Anyway....if you arent aware, here is how it works.....There are literally drug dealers on snapchat...and lots of them.  One small aspect of snap chat are snap maps.  it makes it real easy to see where any of your friends are.  you simply go to the map and it shows you were everyone is.  Another aspect is your snap chat story...its just like facebook or instagram feed where you just post stuff and everyone that you want to see it will see it.   

Taking these things into consideration, these guys/girls constantly update their stories with a mixture of cars, bling, cash, guns, girls and then all the drugs that they currently have with them and how much it all costs.  as a kid, all you have to do is snap a dealer ""soccer practice ends in 10 mins, this is where I am, my moms gonna be 20 mins late, Ill take zannies, lean, cookies and cream and some shatter"" its that easy and your kid just bought xanax, codeine, marijuana and another form of smokable THC.  They can get vape, dabs, pills, pot, guns, whatever anyone is selling.  Doesnt matter where you live, how nice it is or how many gates there are.  There are people in your community selling drugs and they can and will get to your kids on snapchat.  Any moment your child is not within your sites, they can be buying drugs...its that easy.  You can go 500 miles away on vacation and your child can link up with a drug dealer before the plane lands or you park the car.  Thats just the reality of whats going on

&amp;#x200B;

Im my kids case, on his phone he was following like 15 of these guys.  Did he buy and use...yup!  Did I catch him..yup!  Is he now drug tested minimum once a week...yup!  I digress a bit from this to bring up mspy

&amp;#x200B;

i tried mspy for like 2 hours and realized it ain't the answer.  there is nothing out there that can monitor snapchat...i mean nothing.   even rooting an iPhone and adding mspy doesn't work...or work well....and on a side note, mspy...once they get your money, good luck getting a refund, they will do anything other than give you your money back.  As I said, I bought it, tried it for less than 24 hours and then realized it wasn't the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Im going to end this WOT with a request for any diligent parents to post their monitoring solutions.  Also, I appreciate all comments but if you're gonna tell me to not allow snapchat, dont bother...its the only way the kids are communicating unfortunately.  removing it puts them on a socially void island....believe me, I watched it for 2 months while he was grounded from his phone and its hard to witness them being cut out of their social group",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2819987,public,self,"Dangers of snapchat, mspy is HORRIBLE (read inside), any suggestions on monitoring",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/j870qy/dangers_of_snapchat_mspy_is_horrible_read_inside/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

My daughter is 13 years old, she is a shy and timid soul. The type that hides behind her long hair and actively avoids any situation she isn't comfortable with (we're working on that).

On Wednesday (7th Oct) she was walking back home after getting off the school bus and a woman drove up to her in her car and stopped my daughter and accused her of bullying a boy (also from my daughters school). My daughter denied this and eventually ignored the lady and walked away.

It transpires that a group of school children were throwing berries at each other. The group consisted of a friend of my daughters, the friends brother, brothers friend and another boy (lets call him 'J'). My daughter was not throwing berries as has been confirmed by my daughter and 3 of the other four pupils.

The woman who stopped my daughter witnessed the berry throwing and interpreted it as J being bullied. She has apparently pulled over to talk to J who has told this lady he was being bullied and that my daughter and my daughters friend were attempting to force him into eating the berries and were punching him. J is well known at the school for embellishing the truth and has been in trouble multiple times for punching other students.

I find it quite disturbing that this lady has then actively sought out a 13 year old child (from where she spoke to J to where she stopped my daughter is about 1/4 mile) to then berate her in the street. Furthermore she has then posted to a community Facebook group about the incident, giving details of what school my daughter goes to, what bus stop she gets off at and what year at school she is in (this is the UK btw). This post has over 100 comments from what can only be described as a Facebook mob (and of course plaudits for her). The comments consist of people calling for those involved to be exposed, to be expelled and encouraging people to phone the school to express their anger.

The later of the above has been happening and random people have been contacting the school demanding justice. 

My daughter is now scared to get the bus home for fear of these Facebook vigilantes. I am beyond angry about this - I have logged the incident with the Police as no adult should be stopping a CHILD in the street to intimidate them and to then further it by doing the Facebook post. The Police told me this is common and the people that post such things on Facebook don't actually care about any of what they're posting about, they're just looking for attention for themselves. 

I also feel that this woman is now in fact the bully, by intimidating my daughter and causing potential issues at the school.

I had written a long message to her calling her out on what she's done, but then I thought better of it as she'll likely ignore anything I say and just use it to make another Facebook post.

The woman in question did ring the school to report what J told her, which is fine, and is all the action she needed to have taken. But she has overstepped the mark with her additional actions, of which the Police agree with me on. The Police have said they will be speaking to her about stopping children in the street, I have also reported her post to Facebook, not that I expect them to do anything about it.

Apart from that there isn't any other recourse, I'm so very angry, if this gets around school and my daughters name comes up it may well cause issues at the school for her with other pupils (of course not something this woman would have stopped to think about).

It started a little bit after turning 1, she started to refuse foods, gagging and screaming bloody murder. I brought it up to her pediatrician and was told it was just a phase. At 2 1/2 she was essentially eating crackers, cookies, blueberries, yogurt, peanut butter, and milk. That was it. No bread, no meat, no cheese. It didn‚Äôt matter if I put my foot down, and didn‚Äôt let her have anything, she would just stare at her plate and not eat anything that wasn‚Äôt on the small list of ‚Äúok foods‚Äù. She‚Äôs the kid who will eat junk but immediately stop when she‚Äôs full, leaving candy, cookies, etc half eaten. She started food therapy about 6 months ago and has made some progress. She‚Äôs eating cashews, green beans (sometimes), blackberries and even asked to try some toast with no prompting. We are still actively working on mashed potatoes, applesauce, and chicken nuggets in at home therapy and while she has a hard time with mashed potatoes, and applesauce, she seems to enjoy chicken nuggets (but won‚Äôt eat it unless she‚Äôs doing therapy). This week we tried a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which we thought would be no big deal since she took to chicken nuggets so easily. 

Well, we were wrong. 

She screamed, gagged, spit, cried, and almost threw up. The therapists encouraged me to work through it at the clinic session, when she opened her mouth, I had to put a very tiny peace of sand which in her mouth and when she swallowed, she would get immediately rewarded. This went on for 15-20 minutes and she would just keep spitting it out. Finally we left the room (after the session) for a minute or two to let her calm down, and the specialists were able to get her to swallow her sandwich bite. We were told to do at home food therapy with the things she already was doing ok with ( mashed potatoes, chicken nuggets, applesauce). 

Well we tried applesauce at home first, and now, instead of being open and accepting of her foods, she fought, she kicked, she smacked and hit, screamed, and cried. The whole time. Nothing was an incentive. I thought it was the worst it could get.

Today, we worked on mashed potatoes, normally she does better with this than applesauce, but it was the same difficult behavior. I had to have someone gently hold her arms because I literally could not attempt to get the spoon near her mouth (the food specialists advised that this was ok to do) and unfortunately my father in law was the only one available. 

As a background my father in law doesn‚Äôt believe in psychology, so naturally, she‚Äôs having a fit spitting food everywhere and he‚Äôs complaining how this therapy was useless and she‚Äôs perfectly fine. Excuse me, but my kid has been evaluated by doctors, food specialists, social workers, and dietitians who have all deemed that my child seriously needs this therapy, so unless you have a degree, you have nothing to say on how ‚Äúfine‚Äù she is. She hasn‚Äôt gained any weight in over 6 months, she‚Äôs 29 lbs at almost 3 1/2 years old and hasn‚Äôt gained weight in a while, you can see her ribs and her doctors are worried about her nutrition because she doesn‚Äôt eat entire food groups.  It‚Äôs not fine, she hasn‚Äôt grown out of her food issues, it‚Äôs gotten worse over time.  And I‚Äôm about to backhand a man who thinks he‚Äôs suddenly a food specialist/expert on child behavior but also doesn‚Äôt believe in psychology. Oh my god. 

I sent an email to food clinic telling them her behaviors and they said to take a break for the weekend and the food specialist and social worker will help work through the issues in a clinical session. Thank God.

My husband and I were both raised very different. I grew up in a sheltered, conservative, Christian household.

Over the last few months, we sold our house, moved in with his parents for a few weeks, and eventually moved in our own house.
Since the day we started staying with his parents, my husband changed from the goofy silly dad he used to be, (don‚Äôt get me wrong, he still had a temper and would get on our son for specific things before the whole moving ordeal) and into his dad 2.0.

He was born around 5-6 weeks premature (they think actually probably closer to 2 months early). So he's closer to 18 m/o gestationally (So for all intents and purposes thats what doctors go by as far as milestones).

Anyways there are a few things that worry me:  


1. His language development: He ""talks"" quite a bit, he knows mom/dad and i've heard him say ""cat"" and ""dog"" before but we sorta had to point and say it. Otherwise he hasn't said a whole lot of actual words. He used to say ""this"".  He tries to say a lot of different words ""ga/dee/dis/jim"" stuff like that (but not like ""real"" words)
2. He doesn't really respond to his name, he gets very ""zoned"" out. This worries me as I know it's like an autism thing. My mom said my brother used to do the same thing (he's not autistic) so maybe he's just ignoring us?
3. He doesn't really wave. Sometimes he has before but then he just doesn't much (usually when I am leaving the babysitter he is too focused on all the stuff outside). However he has waved before so I know he ""can"" do it.
4. He's super picky about foods (but I know this is just a toddler thing)

Things that make me less worried:

1. I do not believe he has autism as he basically doesn't exhibit any signs. He smiles and laughs and will look you in the face. He gives big hugs and kisses and generally doesn't really act like any of the signs that autistic kids portray.
2. As far as his motor skills they are fantastic. He walks backwards/runs/dexterity is good and all of that.
3. He seems to have a lot of personality, gets sad/happy. Doesn't seem like he has neutral emotions or anything.

Should I be worried. I mean I expected him to be a little behind but the name responding thing sorta bothers me but maybe he's just stubborn (which he is a strong willed kid) and the talking thing I do wish he said more.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2819712,public,self,Worried about Toddlers development [20 m/o],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/j85dmm/worried_about_toddlers_development_20_mo/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,0

My wife and I have a 3.5-year-old boy and a 4-month-old girl. I have had issues with depression all my life, but have been doing really well for the last 5 or so years. The arrival of my daughter has sent me into a mental health tailspin that I don't see any way out of.

Part of it stems from the fact that I never really was in love with the idea of a having a second child. My wife really really wanted one, whereas on my best day my opinion was ""well I think I could live with it"". My wife pushed and pushed and cajoled me until I relented, and thus my daughter came to be.

Yes, I recognize that I ultimately agreed to the second kid, and nobody put a gun to my head, but I am beyond miserable. I'm now on an anti-depressant and going to therapy, something I haven't needed either of in almost 20 years.

On the days my wife is home with us, I do a decent job of staying positive and feeling decent, mentally. My wife works 20 hours a week, with Monday and Friday being long, all-day shifts.

On the days my wife is gone and I have the two kids, my mental health completely plummets, to the point that I start weighing the pros and cons of killing myself. No, I have no active plan or intention to do so, it's just an intrusive thought that I have to deal with.

I don't know what to do. My wife has to work for financial security, but these days are killing my soul. I feel like a shitty father to be incapable of taking care of my daughter for a whopping two full days. I love spending time with my son, truly. But with my daughter I'm resentful and absolutely hate the newborn / infant stage.

Since I met him 5 years ago I think he has gone through about 4-5 cars. When we were friends he told he had gotten like 20 traffic tickets like if he was proud since we have gotten into a relationship he has not mentioned things about tickets and stays pretty quiet about what‚Äôs going on with his pending..what do you call it court case? ...he said he wasn‚Äôt at fault but if it wasn‚Äôt his fault how is he getting sued ?! And why isn‚Äôt he doing everything in his power to pay for a lawyer to take care of the matter ?  I am concerned for his life, my life, and other people‚Äôs lives. I understand mistakes happen but what I don‚Äôt understand is how these mistakes KEEP happening it‚Äôs not like you are 14 years old this man is 28 years old. If you are a reasonable driver the chances of getting into wrecks are slim to none unless if there is a irresponsible driver that you are unlucky to be at the wrong place and at the wrong time you will suffer for their incompetence to drive a motor vehicle. there other things that have concerned me from his actions and words but this is definitely concerning. I am a single parent and he has taken on a fatherly role which Is the reason why I have stayed he was selfless enough to be in a relationship with me knowing he would be taking that responsibility in the future if we were to get married.  I stopped letting him take my son a LONG time ago. I have stopped getting in his care especially with covid if we go any where I always say let‚Äôs go in my car and I tell him that I will drive MY car because despite it being in my car he still wants drive ??!? We are engaged He always talks about getting married and when are we going to get married I told him when he gets done with school I have gotten my bachelors and he still is working to complete his associates to become a nurse granted he is working full time. When we met we both were working part time and in college which is what attracted me to him he had goals and ambitions I didn‚Äôt know anything else about him. When We were friends I found out he was getting so drunk with coworkers and as a friend I was furious I was telling him what are you doing to yourself ?!? He was going to get himself killed. Then months (can‚Äôt remember how many months ) after once we were in a relationship he took it upon himself to quit the pt job, stop going to school and work a ft job. It‚Äôs something he wanted so bad. He was thinking he wanted a ft job to support me and my son?!but I‚Äôve never asked him for money occasionally he would buy my groceries and we would go out like out to eat, movies fast forward I get my degree, I have a good paying job 60k on paper but actual net 40-60l &amp; the pandemic forced me to quit due to provide online education to my son and I have enough money saved up to support me and my son to get through this time and I‚Äôm applying to jobs figuring out a game plan to get out of this. (Bless my parents) I am applying for jobs while simultaneously physically training to become a cop during this time and apply first thing in January when there‚Äôs openings.  While he on the other hand hates his job, he refuses to quit to focus on school because he says he wants more savings  before he quits and failing his classes because he is having a hard time with virtual classes. granted he needs to help pay bills living with his family but all he is doing is pushing himself back from doing what he wants to do and for us to actually start living our lives together. That‚Äôs the way I see it but am I wrong ? What other perspectives are there ? 

My Question is, if I‚Äôm in a relationship with him,  should I be empathetic and be understanding ? Or stop making decisions on ‚Äúlove‚Äù and leave the relationship ?  I believed this man was my soulmate am I weak to give up on a relationship they require work ?!

We live in Canada and we've been handling covid reasonably well except for a few pockets.

My son's mom used to live here, but this summer wound up moving several hours away. She just so happened to move to the largest covid hotspot in our province. Numbers are exploding there and with out thanksgiving this weekend and our provincial government sending a lot of mixed signals we're projected to have some pretty serious outbreaks.

My concern is this: I have opted to have my son do remote learning. That's fine here in our small town. She wants our son to visit for two weeks at the end of this month but I have some massive concerns.

For starters she has 4 other kids, all in public school. She has displayed questionable decision making in recent days by dragging her children out to all sorts of tourist traps, and what I view as the worst is her standpoint on it:

""God will protect us.""

Soak that in a minute.

She has an infant son with a serious heart defect and our son is immunocompromised.

Since she moved our custody agreement has sort of fallen away as it was built around her living in town, so now we're just sort of winging it. I know I can't keep him from his mom and siblings, nor do I have a desire to.

I'm just super uncomfortable with this visit when she's displayed such a laid back attitude about all this. We've been discussing it all morning and it's becoming more and more alarming to me as she seems to be leaning harder and hard toward the ""god will handle it"" argument.

Her pediatrician has been on me the last couple of checkups that she's not gaining as quickly as they'd like to see.

The feeds slowly moved earlier and earlier without my acknowledgment because I thought it was okay.  Then the 5th day she wanted fed at 5 am (adding a 3rd feed) which is OK with me- gives me time to pump at 7 am when she wakes up. Then she wanted fed at 1030 last night, I did it because I thought it would replace the 1145 feed. She woke up at 1145 expecting to be fed, so I fed her. Then 130 which I thought was her 3 am feed (since they have progressively been moving up in time) but she still awoke at 3 for her feed. And then 5. This is all after a 5 oz bottle at 8.

I am a 25yo new mom who gave birth in March this year, right when the world was goin nuts with covid. Watching the news and seeing ppl die or suffer with that illness made me extremely anxious, to the point I was afraid of stepping outside in front of my house. ( Not to mention all the crazy relatives who desperately wanted to see the baby right away, and I refused them all). I was ( still am, since there are TONS of new cases in my country) scared to death and wanted to protect my baby at all costs.

Fastforward, she is 6m-7m old now. She met a couple of relatives once, and my parents ( a lot, since they are the only people I trust). She didn't get daily walks outside. She didnt get to see crowded places much, except parks, a few times. I feel like this will impact her social development a lot if I don.t change something now ( but I am hella scared to let people come over or touch her).

A few days ago I went with my husband and her to the market ( i saw lots of other ppl with their babies there for a while now so I took a leap of faith).The moment we stepped into the market she looked around terrified of the new environment and people walking around grabbing things, then she started crying. In that moment I felt like I was the shittiest mom on Earth. I probably am. I  desperately want her to see and meet other people more often, other faces, but at the same time I am scared to death of the potential risk of her getting the virus. My anxiety spiked, and don't know what to do.  It's extremely hard for me to get out of this ""keep baby safe"" in a 100% mode, I feel like I'm going mad. When my FIL approaches her, my anxiety goes over the roof again. ( FIL is very outgoing).

How can I change things without me going insane about covid? I feel like time is running low and need to slowly but surely let her interact with more people and see new places, but the thought of it makes me almost cry of concern. I want her to grow up normally, but covid-free as well :(

[TL:DR at end, and so folks know, I live in Australia, it‚Äôs 8:45 pm as I post this so if I don‚Äôt respond in the next ten hours, it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm attempting to deal with getting used to a CPAP machine and can‚Äôt hear the alert... or I‚Äôm sleeping. Also, chose what I thought was the most appropriate of the half dozen flairs I could have used. Hope I chose wisely.]

Problem: way too many to count but right now I‚Äôm out of sorts because of my 7yr old‚Äôs eating habits. He is incapable of finishing food I know he will eat within two hours of being served it. Be it whatever reason he will do things like eat corn kernels one by one or individual bulbs of a floret of broccoli (I watched him take a half an hour to get only 1/4 of his way around a single piece of broccoli). 

Now, this is an issue that could be rooted in many different areas. 

It might be because he is physically incapable of eating said food that fast. But why then can he consume three 8‚Äù soft shell tacos in 10 minutes yet take an hour to eat six nuggets and ten fries? 

Perhaps he‚Äôs just choosing not to eat what he doesn‚Äôt want to and making sure to draw out dinner for as long as possible so it gets cut off by bedtime? This - to me - is the most likely cause. He gets dinner around 6pm and has a shower before bed at 7:30. So an hour and a half usually unless I‚Äôm run off my feet in which case dinner gets out at 6:30 at the latest. 

With physical and behavioural issues out of the way, the only real possibility left is a psychological one. Perhaps he‚Äôs super ocd about eating and MUST consume things one at a time. I know enough people with OCD to know this is a possibility, with one unable to eat mixed foods but can eat individual ingredients fine (at dinners with her there‚Äôs a seperate salad plate with everything separated just for her). But with everything else he does being so damn random, and with several friends with OCD (so I know what to look for to a certain degree) I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs this.

Partnered with OCD but less likely is that he may be on the spectrum or has some form of ADD. He‚Äôs an avid reader but hates doing things in class, has a hard time making friends because of ‚Äòbehavioural issues‚Äô that his school psych wont go into detail about (really do not like that woman) and when confronted about anything just communicates in silence or grunts. 

Problem part II is that I don‚Äôt know how much of this is because he‚Äôs a seven year old or further the fact that two years ago he had to deal with his mother having a series of strokes that left her hospitalised for five months and permanently totally and completely blind afterwards (not to mention Bells Palsy and seizures). This could be a cry for attention. Or not. I have no idea.

Problem part III is that my partner - the aforementioned blind mother - is of the firm belief that absolutely nothing is wrong with him and she is very vocal about how my ‚ÄúDetermination that there must be something wrong with our son‚Äù is disturbing to her. And that there can‚Äôt possibly be anything wrong. She is flat out against me getting him tested for Autism (among other things) and refuses to entertain civil discussion as soon as I mention anything could possibly be wrong with him.

My son has been seeing a psych once a month since February, and twice a month since August. We can barely afford it, but I‚Äôve taken on a new diet to cut down on spending, so hope that will be enough. I really don‚Äôt like the psych he sees. Not because I get bad codes from him or anything like that. In fact, he came quite highly recommended from a couple who‚Äôs son saw him for a while when they were going through a divorce. But in my opinion, this guy is completely ineffective. In fact, if I bring up an issue for him to talk to my son about, inevitably within the next few days (or in some cases, that afternoon) he will blatantly go against what was asked of him seemingly out of spite. Example: immediately after a session where I asked they talk about lying and the consequences therein, he bald-faced lies to me about eating all his lunch at school and managed to score an ice cream from it. I was too naive to check, so to some degree that‚Äôs on me. 

Between my son‚Äôs inability to eat what I‚Äôve cooked for him, my partners maddening opinion that there can‚Äôt possibly be anything wrong and how dare I even consider it, and all the other shit I have to go through on a daily basis, I‚Äôm losing it. There‚Äôs not enough money for my partners meds, my sons psych, her psych and a psych for me - not that it matters because the backlog for adult psychologists is measured in years where I am - and all my friends and family are encouraging me to keep up with his psych because ‚Äòthese things aren‚Äôt fixed immediately‚Äô. 

And look, I know it takes time. I have to be patient and keep trying things until something works. But I‚Äôm out of ideas. One night he‚Äôll eat the plain chicken I‚Äôve cooked him, the next he won‚Äôt touch it. Sometimes he‚Äôll eat the carrot I cut up for him, sometimes he‚Äôll take a full hour just to nibble on one stick. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is setting a timer and taking the food away after a half hour. If he hasn‚Äôt eaten it, then tough shit. But enough people have told me that that‚Äôs child endangerment or abuse or whatever that I‚Äôm hesitant to. Tried reward systems multiple times, they didn‚Äôt work. Positive reinforcement (dessert), negative reinforcement (no electronics for a day), and so on, but nothing gets through to him. 

Just came out of a shouting match with my partner about this, and I‚Äôm just so tired and depressed. But that... that‚Äôs a different post altogether. I‚Äôm already going behind her back by having booked an appointment last month for him to see a specialist and get tested for being on the spectrum along with everything else (bipolar, DID, etc), but they‚Äôre backlogged until April 2021.

Not sure anymore if I‚Äôm looking for advice, or just venting. Sorry if there are glaring spelling or grammar mistakes. I‚Äôm on mobile and autocorrect loves fucking with me.

TL:DR; my son may be purposefully refusing to eat food I know he likes, causing his dinner time to extend past one, sometimes two hours. Or he may not.

Like if I‚Äôm in the bathroom and can‚Äôt come to the door he will keep doing it until someone does. (I was in the shower once and he did it for 10 mins straight because no one was home to open the door other than me) 
I have a toddler who gets woken up every time if she‚Äôs asleep when he does it . Hell sometimes I‚Äôm trying to get some shut eye myself. 
He also stresses my dog. My dog has never acted aggressively towards anyone but when the knocking starts my dog get visible agitated and at this point will growl if he even sees the kid while we walk. 

I tried to be nice and ask him to tone it down. It he wasn‚Äôt listening so I asked his mom to talk to him. And it hasn‚Äôt got any better
 I have anxiety and depression (diagnosed ) and when he does it it really gets to me. 

This week I snapped, it‚Äôs been rough week and he started so I snapped at him, it definitely wasn‚Äôt the nicest tone,  I wasn‚Äôt yelling or cursing or threatening  him, but I was obviously firm/serious and annoyed with a slightly raised voice.

Well I guess that scared him so he told his mom and she‚Äôs been harassing me every chance she gets about respecting boundaries and not parenting other people‚Äôs children. 

I find it funny she‚Äôs talking about boundaries when she can‚Äôt even teach her son any. 
I ended up telling her I was feeling harassed in my own home. Especially because sometimes if I do open the door and tell him not right now or my son doesn‚Äôt want to play  he tries to force my door open or put his foot in my door way to stop my from shutting the door

. I told her if her son wants to play with mine he can wait until my son chooses to go outside but since he doesn‚Äôt know how to control himself I don‚Äôt want him knocking at my door anymore.

I was not in a good relationship. It was very controlling and not healthy. When I finally got enough strength to not only kick my ex out, but also the courage to let him know I was calling the police if he didn‚Äôt actually leave this time. 
I quit my fulltime job for a casual job, changed my kids school and got a gastric sleeve.

My gorgeous 5month old has Down syndrome. She is bubbly, bright and always smiling. With COVID and no job to go back to I needed a little help recently! When I rang up and explained my situation of a 5mo Down syndrome baby and before I could explain needing extra money for Drs appointments over paying bills, (appointments to see what she‚Äôll need for the future, not that there is anything wrong at the moment), just for the moment, people would always interject with I am sorry! 
I am not, my baby is gorgeous, she is a blessing and has only made us happier. 
Only one energy Australia call centre worker waited to hear what I wanted say and then said, what is the best help we can give you? That one reaction was incredible. I needed an 8 day bill payment extension. I was at a point before of not wanting to call and ask for help.

I taught myself in an online private high school which i paid for and graduated early with a 3.9 GPA. I've worked since i was 14, sometimes 2 jobs. 
Well, this year i got pregnant. Before I get hate, i will say I was on the pill and we did not expect this. However, my boyfriends (22m) and i (18f) relationship isn't the most sturdiest. we have a lot of love, but we are up and down. i moved in with him when i found out...but that didn't turn out well. so after a while i moved back in with my narcissistic father. 

i pay for everything basically for myself except car insurance, gas, and phone bill. he pays for those. but i've noticed and been told he uses payments as a way to control me. well recently i have been told information about him and i do not trust him around a child. he also is very emotionally abusive, sexist and perverted.. so i have been standing up for myself on things he does and says recently and he's not been liking it. 

like... telling him he should be nicer to the server because the server did nothing on purpose and him BLOWING up, calling me names and cussing, and then slapping my face when i say i didn't deserve that. or him telling me very inappropriate and ODD sex related jokes... um recently me asking him nicely in front of a guest to not go in my rooms please. and him getting a deep mean voice and telling me he pays for them, he will go in when he wants and then opening the door  which i then find out he didn't go in it he just turned the knob to ""piss me off"". i could go on to further explain i am not being excessive when i say narcissistic a-hole.

WELL. he recently said that i need to find a place ""fast"" because of something he actually did with some else to get her mad at ME and it backfired on him because i did nothing so she doesn't want to talk to him anymore and he doesn't like that i've been standing up for myself and so have other people.

i don't want to live with my boyfriend. i love him but  his house is unbearable and would take a bit of work to fix and keep fixed and not safe for a baby. he lives in a basement of his dads house. i am unable to move with my mom or grandma bc i have 3 dogs and they live in apartments. so i am really just stuck on where to go. i'll do what i have to do and have money saved up and good credit score but not enough to buy a house and i can't go to an apartment and i will be unable to work for a while as well because of the newborn. so extra bills that i was told i wouldn't have to plan for while having the baby, to help me, are now on me as well. 


What can i do to help me right now? Should I try to save more before due date (december) to try to rent a house for 6 months rent upfront? I don't think i can reason with him and i didn't think he would just make me leave especially with me 10 weeks from having a baby. i know i'm a good young woman and my other family/mom knows this and knows how he is because he is the same to some of them. I want to try my best to be independent right now and not lean on someone else, but it's difficult. Are there any tips out there for my situation?

She was on hormonal b/c that failed. 

We had been friends since my sophomore year of HS and dated on and off between my junior and senior year.  From the time we met, she was very possessive of me and had a somewhat entitled attitude (despite having a boyfriend at the time). Over the years, we went through so much together that the other girls in my life saw me as off limits (I actually had a girl break up with me because she felt like she was competing with my ex who was just a friend at the time). Deep down I knew we weren't a good match romantically but by then, I was too emotionally attached/desperate and not really thinking clearly about the relationship.

This wasn't the first time I got her pregnant but the first time she miscarried. She was against having an abortion and I felt very strongly about her so I wanted to support her decision though I couldn't stand the thought of having a child at that stage in my life. We stayed together through the first few months of her pregnancy but over the summer 17, about halfway through the pregnancy, I realized that we weren't a good fit for each other and I couldn't keep faking like I wasn't distressed.

I grew up fairly poor and didn't have a great relationship with my parents who had been separated since I was a toddler. Before I went to college my mother threatened to kick me out several times. I told my girlfriend that I couldn't tell my parents for fear of them disowning me but I would try to support her however I can. Obviously being a poor college student, I couldn't help much but her family was supportive apparently and more wealthy than mine so it didn't hurt too much.

I go to school in another state (I tried transferring but didn't have the funds for the admission fee at the time) and the fact that I couldn't help financially or be there physically was very demoralizing for me.

I grew up very independent and pride myself on being self sufficient so much so that it became much of my identity. My family never coddled me and I was left to my own devices early in life, as my mom worked long hours as a nurse. I was a very smart child and did my own chores, made my own food etc since I was about 6 or 7. I usually liked to play by myself and found other people my age to be too ""stupid"" to understand me so I spent much of my time in isolation. I suspect that I'm on the autistic spectrum and I find it really hard to build genuine connections with others. I can be a very open and social person but it usually comes with a lot of anxiety about how others perceive me. Growing up, I would constantly offend others with my behavior or opinions and truly not understand why they'd take offense. I find it hard to express my emotions and I'm often labeled as uncaring but I'm actually a deeply caring and considerate person as I'm now hyper-aware of my impact on others. Now I'm just scared to be myself for fear of inadvertently ruining my relationships. I have a deep insecurity about my relationships and don't have many friends now that I'm out of school. I have trouble maintaining relationships with people that I don't see consistently. I think I need body language to truly feel comfortable communicating because I often misinterpret words and am very frequently misunderstood. I have anxiety about reaching out to friends as I feel like I'm being a nuisance or burden. I generally feel like I'm a nuisance and burden to others which has become my new motivation for being alone.

I say all of this to say that, now after being away at college for some years and still not successfully managing my anxiety, I'm a stranger to my child and don't have much of a relationship with their mother. As you've probably guessed, I can barely hold a conversation with the mother. Every time I talk to her I just feel terrible about the situation and I try to build rapport but I'm really just too embarrassed and self loathing.  I've been paying child support for about a year now and have been buying his monthly supply diapers and wipes since this past summer. Being able to contribute somewhat has helped me alleviate some of the shame I've been feeling. I feel like now I'm at least a little bit worthy of trying to be a father but I still can't really talk to her and it's going to be about a year before I can move back home to be near them.

I just want to know what I should do. How do I rebuild that relationship with my ex who has since told me she felt abandoned and like she doesn't want my help? How can I be there for my child even though I can't physically be around? How do I get past these feelings of embarrassment and inadequacy? How do I work with my communication issues? What should I be striving for as a father given the circumstances? At first I was angry at her for keeping the child (I don't understand why anyone would keep a child they're not the least bit prepared for) and disappointed in myself for not living up to my own life expectations. I had to do a lot of soul searching to come to peace with the situation and try not to be so hard on myself but obviously I'm still struggling with not being able to be there.

I used to just sit in his room until he fell asleep, but I'm trying to break that habit, but that's not working very well so far. 

Any suggestions? Please be kind, this is my first time being a parent and I'm doing my best. Thanks

She is manipulative and just a mean kid most of the time. 

For background, when she was 2 yo her father and I split. We also have a 11 yo boy. They currently live in a different state and we video call and keep up with each other regularly and visit several times a year. Despite all of this, she has always been the kid to get into stuff, even when her father and I were together. At one and two year old she would slip off from me for a few minutes and find things to explore. She has found nail polish in the bathroom and painted her toes and foot, put mascara all over her face, cut her hair twice,etc. and as of recent she colored on my glasses, scratched my screen protecter on my phone with a rock we got from the science center, colored on the wall twice, swallowed a dime, etc. She has also within the last 1.5 yr randomly peeing her pants before she made it all the way to the toilet. This isn‚Äôt often but has happened over 20+ times. She would make it to the bathroom and as she pulled her pants off she would pee all over the place. I like to think I have always gave her more attention than my son. Having a little girl was something I always wanted. I was 18yo when her brother was born and I tried my best but was still new to all of it. With her I got to do all the things I wasn‚Äôt able to do with my son. I breastfed her for 14 months, glass bottles only, made her baby food, and was particular about other things as well. 

We moved to another state a year ago to be with my bf of two years. He has two sons around her age(5,7). They are with us for a week, every other week. They do get along but just like normal kids they love to pester each other. They have a hard time keeping their hands to themselves, say mean things to each other and sometimes lie that one kid did something wrong when they didn‚Äôt. 

We all have been stressed during Covid. I work 3 twelve hour night shifts a week, I am taking 2 online classes, the 5 yos started kindergarten and the 7 yo started first grade(all virtual), among all the other household tasks to take care of. They all are doing well in school. She is really good with her video calls( sitting still, keeping quiet, muting and unmuting), learning her letter and sight words. As far as discipline, I am pretty quiet and don‚Äôt really yell but I have been getting short with the kids for the last 2 months or so. I have all this built up stress and it‚Äôs taking a toll on me. I am trying to work on it and I know this is probably part of what has caused my lo to act out. 

Back to her though. She loves to irritate the boys by picking fights, lying about things they may have been doing(I can hear their conversations though), breaking toys and legos, hiding remotes, not listening to directions, and throwing emotional tantrums when things aren‚Äôt going her way. She is a very head strong child. I‚Äôll admit that my time is spread thin and she should probably get more positive attention. It‚Äôs so tough to be sweet with her when I feel like I am just rewarding her for bad behavior. I try to reason with her, help her understand her feelings, help her understand my feelings, talk about good citizens and bad citizens, took away tablets, and tv, stood in the corner. I mean nothing works for her. I just want her to listen and not lie.

I'm irritated with both of them. I want to say, it was just a look. Like seriously, I get it, the look sucks, but it was just a look. I talked to the kids about being respectful because he's doing me a favor.... 
I'm stressed to the max, I don't ask much of the bf because he has his own kids and set of issues separate from me &amp; mine. This one time that I did, he's ""letting me know"" about a look, and I am having a convo with the kids about respect.

When asked yes or no questions she often just says one even if it‚Äôs known to be untrue by the person asking or when asked ‚Äúeither or‚Äù type questions she‚Äôll often just say one and then the other a second later 

Tonight she and her dad took a shower together. They do that from time to time. I don‚Äôt check on them, didn‚Äôt think I needed to. 
(We‚Äôve all been home together for two weeks. Before that, long story, but nothing concerning. She and I were at my parents house for awhile because he was gone working and I needed childcare.)
So they are done and he is dressed and she‚Äôs playing in the tub. He tells me he‚Äôs going to take the dog for a walk if I have it from here which I do so he leaves with the dog. She was scratching was scratching at her vagina. I said that she looked red down there, does she itch? She said yeah. Later she went to get out and she sat down and spread her legs and was gently itching. She said it hurts that she had a boo boo and needed to go to the doctor. Note this isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs said that about down there but I‚Äôve never really thought anything of it before and tbh I can‚Äôt remember of her dad was with her all of those times. I generally take her and put some rash cream on and she says all better. 
So this time I went to do that and I put it on, not where she was complaining about and asked what happened? She told me that ‚Äúdaddy touched her down there and got a boo boo‚Äù I was shocked. I asked if she was sure. Then I asked did mommy touch you? She said yeah, I asked did daddy touch you? She said yeah. Then I asked if it was mommy or daddy who did it. She said ‚Äúmommy... daddy.

Know what it‚Äôs called. 

I walked in and looked at them and I thought I saw something weird but the glass was weird and he looked shocked but it could be because the door was really loud when I opened it. I always jump when the doors open to either of our bathrooms because they both have towel racks on them and it‚Äôs really loud and shocking. what I thought I saw was her standing with her mouth open and him rubbing his penis. I was like what are you doing. And he said in just washing my balls. I was like ok. And didn‚Äôt think much of it because I didn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt seem upset or offer me any information So I left and got in the car and realized I didn‚Äôt have my wallet so I walked back in and looked down the hall because I thought he was struggling getting her out of the shower and he might need help, I saw that he wasn‚Äôt struggling so I grabbed my wallet and left. He then texted me and said ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre doing and I really don‚Äôt appreciate it‚Äù
So I called him and asked him about that and he told me that he thought I was coming back in to check on them because I thought that he was doing something to our daughter. I assured him that I just forgot the wallet and I thought that he might need help and when I realized he didn‚Äôt i left. And he went on to tell me That he totally understands why and maybe he did it to himself that I think he‚Äôs some sexual pervert. Something to do with sex toys he buys for us. I told him no, I didn‚Äôt think that and that was the end of it. Note, I do think that but I didn‚Äôt think it would be anything having to do with children, just him exerting control over me. I have plans to leave him, but I need to know how much i need to fight for sole custody but I‚Äôm not in the business of ruining his life over false accusations either. 

But I decided to have a conversation with her about bodily autonomy and consent and to tell me if anything happens and if anyone touches her on her vagina, but that diaper changes are different because we have to wipe her well, especially when she poops. (She‚Äôs not into potty training yet but we wear parties for 1-2 hours everyday to get used to it) 

So basically, I‚Äôm worried that me asking what happened prompted her to answer me in a way that I may have suggested I wanted to hear by having the conversation with her two weeks ago. But I also don‚Äôt want to brush off what she said. But I also don‚Äôt want to have him painted out to be a child molester if he isn‚Äôt... Because at the end of the day even though he might do things to me, that doesn‚Äôt mean He will do it to a child. 

So after I got the diaper on her we were in bed and I asked her again because she was pulling at it what happened to your vagina and she said ‚Äúdaddy touched me on my boo-boo with Mr. Golden Sun‚Äù I asked what mr golden sun looked like and she started singing the lyrics to a Halloween song. So my mind is everywhere but I‚Äôm scared to mention it to him because I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Note: not looking to start a debate, just want some fellow parent opinions.

I understand the typical separation anxiety that comes for every parent the first time their kid gets on the bus, and this isn‚Äôt that. The only reason this is coming up is because COVID. I am a nurse and my wife is a music teacher( currently stay at home mom). 

This decision would be easier if I didn‚Äôt understand viruses and how they work and how difficult it is to contain them. It would be easier if I didn‚Äôt witness first hand what this disease is capable of, not only to those infected but to their families. I understand the statistics and the low likely hood of death/complications but it still seems so irresponsible to just send her into a group of 12 random kids or 8 hours a day, 4 days a week.

Other factors to this decision:  both of our current babysitters are high risk, so they would be out indefinitely. We know one of her teachers through a mutual friend and she says the school is prepped and ready for the kids, including social distancing measures and frequent hand washing/sanitization plans. But we also know how a plan is great but putting it into practice can be difficult.

If not please recommend another page! So my fianc√© thought he had a daughter. They met when she was 4 and the time line seemed right for her to be his. Around November they had a test (I got it for his bday due to money issues previously) the test took forever since it was sent out of the US. Came back negative. Unfortunately he was not able to talk about it to them 100% because the mom just had another baby and was not the best due to covid and healing from the birth. Finally a few weeks ago he was finally able to talk with the girl (currently almost 10 years old) and she pretty much told him that it is pretty much too late. Even if the DNA test was negative she would still be happy to call him her daddy. We plan to try another test later on just in case. Something that will come in much quicker. What I am getting as is the mom is chill, her children are chill. Sounds like they agreed on him still being considered the dad. So what now? I was thinking we would discuss rules so no one crosses the line and tries to manipulate the situation or when she may stay over? I know it may sound insane. Her mom and the girl believed for a long time that he was the dad 100% and was unable to get a test due to money. His family was afraid to get a test for him because they were afraid she would use him. I was in situations like that before and this is a completely innocent situation. So it is sort of too late to try to break the attachments that were formed.

He has two children from a previous marriage, let‚Äôs say, Alice (16F) and Larry (11M).  For the most part the relationships are all amicable, including between myself and his ex wife, Sara (42F). I am now pregnant with my first. The kids live with their mother most of the time but spend a night or two with us every weekend.  Nick drives them to sports, outings, etc whenever he can but he works 12-830pm M-F. 

Alice began applying for her first real job. She was applying at a mall that is a fair distance away, and so while she was applying I was asking my spouse, how will she get to/ from work ? In my opinion, a major part of having a job, for a young person, is to develop independence and life skills. This was never really addressed/ discussed further.  So now she has landed a retail job at that mall and I again asked, how will she get there and home ? The first thing I did was check out the bus routes and she can bus, will take about 45 mins and 2 busses, but I don‚Äôt think this is a very good solution when she‚Äôs leaving at 9-10pm at night. Our city isn‚Äôt the safest city (although that area is pretty safe). 

A couple days ago I get a text message from Alice asking me to take her to work on Thursday (today).  I was frustrated because 1) like I said, I think that a job is not just about the financial independence but also to develop independence and life skills and 2) I don‚Äôt want to be driving her every Thursday to work, I work full time myself, am 6 months pregnant, we‚Äôre moving next week and so I‚Äôm managing finding a subletter for our apartment and packing, I‚Äôm taking an Accounting course and I walk dogs in my spare time, I just don‚Äôt have it in me to add another thing on, especially when I don‚Äôt agree with the principal of it. 

Nick (and I presume Sara) and I disagree about this as Nick says he was driven around a lot by his parents, I responded that ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt know how to take a bus..‚Äô I thought the point of parenting a teenager is to teach them to become independent adults who can manage on their own.  My parents didn‚Äôt drive me around every where, I walked to my first job until I could drive myself. I moved out when I was 18 and again I walked/ drove to work. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm not against EVER driving her to work, if it‚Äôs convenient, if the parents have nothing going on, sure.  But I don‚Äôt think it should be relied upon. I don‚Äôt think she should have even applied to jobs she can‚Äôt get to on her own, say, with more than 1 bus required, or within walking distance. We live in a city and so there are a lot of options in the area.
