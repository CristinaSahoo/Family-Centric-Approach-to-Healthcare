Between my husband traveling for work and COVID I’ve been a full time stay at home mom with zero breaks for like.. 8 months. I love my son so much but he is very active and doesn’t nap anymore and is, of course, a toddler. He’s 2.5. Very strong willed and quick to tantrum. The past month he’s started hitting and kicking me. I have to be honest it makes me feel shitty. I try to be a good parent and we go for lots of walks, hikes, play in the backyard, I play games and puzzles with him, read to him every day, and try to help him feel like he gets to make his own decisions by giving him lots of choices/freedom. He always has tasty healthy food and I keep the house pretty tidy. I try to create a happy environment where we sing and dance and smile a lot. But lately the instant I’m firm about a boundary (which I always give a warning first) he lashes out at me and screams “hit!” Or “kick!” While hitting or kicking me. I’ve gotten good at dodging or gently restraining him. I’ve tried ignoring, validating, and explaining other ways to express “big feelings” but he is attempting to hit/kick me like 10x per day now. 

I had to carry our monthly dog food subscription down to the basement so I did just that, except my toddler started following me down the stairs. Our basement isn’t finished or anything and toddler was in the middle of lunch so I explained that we were going upstairs and he tried to hit me. I carried him upstairs kicking and screaming and put him down. He sulked so I asked if he would like a hug and he wound up and hit me right in the eye. I wasn’t expecting it and I just immediately slapped him in the face. I don’t even know how it happened. I didn’t make a conscious decision I just lost it. It wasn’t super hard but it was hard enough to make a noise and he immediately looked surprised. I feel horrible, like I broke his trust and he’s never going to feel comfortable with me again. I apologized to him a lot and have been reading him his favorite books and giving him lots of snuggles and kisses. 

I guess I’m looking for support, or advice. How do you keep being awesome parents when your cup is empty? How can I make this up to my toddler?

Do kids have like a safeguard in their body that makes them invulnerable to damage from screaming or what's the deal :D? Doesn't it hurt them? Why do kids never sound like they've been smoking 2 packs a day after throwing a tantrum?

My 3-year-old (June bday) son always seems to keep trying new things with his toys until they are eventually broken. All of them. We have tried a lot of different things and can’t really decide what the best course of action is.

For example, for his birthday he got a cool new robot. It is really durable, rated for ages 3+ with activities very much appropriate for my son’s age level. We worked with him a lot at first on how to enjoy the various things the robot could do and he took very good care of it for several months. Then he got bored. I’m sure you can relate.

Now at this point is when I try to stash toys for awhile and then bring them out later for renewed interest. But the robot was special and my son wanted to know where he was, so we got him back out. That’s when the experiments began. The robot shoots discs - will he shoot string cheese? Can he roll in the grass? Should we stuff things in his mouth to see if they fit? We explained all along the way that the robot was not made to do those things. We do stick to an indoor-toy and outdoor-toy system, but the robot would sneak outside or into bed or whatever. Eventually the robot broke and now will only give an error message when he turns on.

My son is confused. Although many toys have broken (and we thank those toys and throw them away), he still does this with each new toy and then is horribly disappointed that they break. And also, I don’t want to buy anymore robots! 

So, do we refuse to buy another robot until he is older? And when should we try again? Do we take toys away when he can’t play nicely, teaching him those rules, or do we let him learn from his own mistakes by letting him keep breaking the toys? What do you do/have you done?

Our 14 month old has still not had an uninterrupted night of sleep and consistently wakes up nearly every 2 hours through the night still.

**His current scheduled is** 

* **wake around 9am**
* **nap 1 around 12pm (1 to 2 hours)**
* **nap 2 around 3:30pm (1 to 2 hours)**
* **bedtime around 7:30pm to 8:30pm**

His current bedtime routine is bedtime stories / winding with his favorite blanket with the lights low, once he starts to get sleepy we'll put him in his crib and he falls asleep almost always immediately.

Then around 2 to 3 hours later he'll wake up crying, want to be picked up / soothed (or sometimes try and nurse if he's very upset) and then go back to sleep. This continues through the entire night every 2 hours (Some nights every hour which are horrible sleep deprived nights for mom and dad) until his wake time.

We've tried different nap schedules, 1 nap days, different bedtime routines and different approaches to handling him when he cries at night. The only thing we haven't tried extensively is just letting him cry himself back to sleep at night - we've tried this once or twice but he just seems to get angrier and angrier over the course of as long as an hour before we decide to go in and sooth.

(And honestly I don't know why I didn't know about this place before. I guess it's hard to believe my kid is growing up!)

Anyways, I'm looking for advice on potty regressions. My daughter is almost 4. Other than at night, she has essentially been potty trained for about a year. We had one regression this past spring with full blown pee accidents and slight pee accidents (enough to get her underwear and pants wet but not enough to have a puddle on the floor). However, I can sort of understand that regression because the changes covid brought as well as a new brother in the house.

Now, for the past 2-3 weeks she has been having a lot of both poop and pee accidents. Especially this last week she has had multiple accidents in a day. We have implemented a ""no snack"" in the evening rule when she has the first accident and more recently a ""no evening TV time"" when she has a second accident in the day. When it has been poop accidents I started having her clean out her underwear but that didn't phase her. The last poop accident I was fed up and just threw her underwear out. She wasn't happy about that but I still don't know if that will phase her. I've tried talking to her about it and asking her why she is having accidents and the best I get is ""I don't know."" The really frustrating thing is when I think I see her doing the potty dance and I ask her if she needs to go. She says no and I leave it because I couldn't be sure if it was the potty dance. And then within the minute she has an accident. 

I'm trying to think if there is any big changes but nothing comes to mind. Her new brother is almost 8 months old. But I am wondering if this could be an attention thing revolving around him. Also, she started pre-K at the beginning of August. It is at the same daycare/school she has been at all along and the accidents didn't start until at least 1.5 months after she started her new class. So I can't imagine it having to do with her school. And she hasn't been having accidents while at school, but I'm honestly not sure if they have a potty schedule still or not. If not then essentially she is purposefully only having accidents when she is not at school.

Quick question.

I have a 22 month old and a 5 week old.  My 22 mo weaned herself off of soothers when she was 6 months old. Never really cared for them. 

Now that we have this new baby, she has been relatively good about the whole thing. I knew she would regress in one form or another.  She doesn’t talk yet (whole other battle) and this passed week she has been obsessed with her little sister’s pacifiers.  Mostly when we are just in the house.  When we are out and about she doesn’t seem to notice.

This is becoming a pain because she will constantly try to steal the baby’s, even when she has one in her mouth already.  If we take any soothers away she will lose her noodle.  

I’m scared her teeth will get bent out of joint or she will be hooked on these suckers.  Any advice? Just wait it out? I do my very best to balance both of the girls and she gets a lot of our attention.

Please forgive some of the stupid questions.
3.5 is my buddy and we've had a great bond from day one, but I'm not quite as close with the 14 mo. Feeling guilty about that and also 3.5 is used to having my undivided attention when I visit but now that they're with me all the time  both are super needy and I don't feel like I'm meeting 3.5s need for attention/love/snuggles because 14mo insists on being held 24/7 and it kills my spine to carry both of them. If I put the baby down (even for 5 minutes to put clothes in to wash or do a tiny bit of dishes) she will fuss and if I let her fuss for a minute it turns into full blown screaming and she intentionally faceplants hard enough that it has to hurt. Is this normal for her age? Will it eventually go away? (Partially this is teething but also she's clingy af even when not teething, and she won't let anyone hold her but me or her mother)
3.5 is pottytrained for during the day but she refuses to potty alone and pretends she needs help even though she normally goes alone at her moms house. Why? Also when should she be able to stop wearing a diaper at night?
Also she insists on calling me mom and we've argued about it for days and she does understand that I'm not mom but she just. Wont. Stop. How do I fix that?
Also how well should 3.5 be talking? She did speech therapy for a while and she's been improving while here but I feel like she should make more sense than what she does. And how much should they weigh? They wear the same size of clothing (2T) but I feel like 3.5 is undersized but probably I'm just being paranoid.
My niece and her husband recently separated and he hasn't had much to do with the little ones since then, what do I tell 3.5 when she asks about him? Sometimes she whispers gibberish in my ear and then ""mama go byebye, daddy go byebye"" and I don't know what to say to her. It happens usually between 1-5 times a day.
How do I get 3.5 to eat?! She's incredibly picky and has realized that I'm a sucker and all she'll eat for me are hot dogs, apples, blueberries, and waffles. I tried baby protein shakes and she hates them.
What should the baby be eating and drinking? She eats everything except oatmeal and I have trouble with how much is too much, plus when her sister refuses food she'll eat that as well as her own. Also her mother said to give her fat free milk so she doesn't get chunky, but I read that they're not supposed to have fat free until after age 3. Can I give both of them toddler formula? 3.5 can't have real milk anyway because it makes her sick.
Working on teaching the baby to sit in a chair at the table in a booster seat and she hates it, is there any way to make that easier?
Any magical tricks to making them sleep at bedtime? 3.5 has an ipad and she's used to staying up on it very late, but while she's here I hide it and she doesn't usually ask for it. Even without the ipad she's still pretty reluctant to sleep and usually falls asleep after the adults do. Rocking and snuggling her does not do the trick. The last couple of nights we put on a movie at 8 and slowly decrease the volume and screen brightness until it's over, but still we fell asleep before she did.

I'm not going to get into the whole story, but here are the highlights: I met a girl in  r/rape who told me via PM that she was impregnated by her rapist. I have gone above and beyond trying to help her, as she wants to keep the child. We have been messaging for months now. She even has a video of me breastfeeding my son because we were talking about latch; I am kicking myself over sending that video, but you can't see my face or my baby's face in it, at least. I think I've been played. I saw that she posted a picture of herself wearing a diaper... W....T.....F? She had been dropping some clues (e.g., she uses a pacifier to prevent panic attacks, focused a little way too much on what my let-down reflex feels like), but it wasn't until I saw the pic of her in a diaper that I felt very betrayed and played. Anyway, I didn't know what ABDL stood for,  so I went to the subreddit. I was in tears after just a few posts. I am beyond disturbed -- though I am still talking to this girl. I turned off my post history because I didn't want her to see this post. If there is even the slightest chance that she truly is pregnant, I want to help her. Btw, there IS some evidence that she truly is pregnant. This isn't the point of my post, though. I just needed to let all this out in a safe space, with normal people. Let me get to it: I sent my reddit friend a link to a podcast by Andrea Olsen. For those who don't know, Andrea is a big EC advocate. I was already weary about keeping my child in diapers too long after listening to Andrea's podcast about a potential link between keeping children in diapers too long and behavioral problems. I decided that as soon as my son could walk, I would begin potty training. My son is 17m, and he didn't start to walk until just a few weeks ago (FTR: He is a freakin' giant -- 99th percentile for height; my wonderful pediatrician warned me to ignore the usual timeline, as everything from rolling over to walking would likely take my son much longer than most babies). 

I'm not saying that keeping children in diapers too long is what causes the ABDL ""kink"", but it made me want to get this F-ing going.

Ever since we started our little guy on solids, he’s loved eating. And once his teeth started coming in, there was no stopping him... he would even steal things off of the rest of the family’s plates if we let him roam around after we thought he was done eating. He was never picky. And always had a great appetite. This lasted a glorious 1.5 years from about 6 months to about 24 months. This was great because we only had to deal with one picky eater, the 6-year-old (but she’d always been pretty picky, so nothing new there.) Then everything changed. 

Starting at around 24 months, he started rejecting food he would usually inhale. (Oddly enough, around the same time, the 6-yr-old started eating a little bit more). But the pasta with homemade meat sauce that was always an easy dinner for both kids became a struggle for him to eat even 1 or 2 pieces of macaroni. He spits everything out and says “all done!”  I’m worried about him not getting enough to eat, or a large enough variety of foods. He only voluntarily eats eggs, cheese, bread, rice, corn, and fruits. Almost everything else is a struggle. I try not to cave in to giving him those foods all the time, because i know it will develop terrible eating habits. Plus I don’t want the older one thinking they can reject food to get me to make macaroni and cheese daily.

My 2.5 year old has been a dream to put to bed at night since she was around 14 months. All we had to do is walk her in, say good night, kisses and walk out. No crying, no whining, she'd fall asleep in a matter of minutes.

Now, however, something has changed. She'll cry unless we sit there until she falls asleep. I try to stay strong, but she's a stubborn little princess. She'll scream and cry for up to an hour, but if we choose to sit down from the very start, she'll fall asleep in a couple of minutes just like before.

It started during the summer when we spent some nights at my family, but it hasn't occurred at home until last week.

No child is perfect, no child loves to share, and I have come to expect this because I have a 4 year old lol.

However my niece is the type that purposely does things to make other kids upset. It seems that she enjoys it very much.

Example: yesterday she asked my daughter if she wanted to play with the ball she was holding. My daughter said sure, and I thought ""how sweet she is sharing."" A minute later my daughter asks for the ball and she said nope its hers. So I asked her why she offered for my daughter to even play with it if she wasn't going to give it to her, she said ""cause I wanted fight with her and not give it to her."" 

My daughter wasn't even interested in the ball till she said anything.

She asked me to get off a swing as she was done. She then notices a random child going towards a different swing and she runs over and tries to knock the kid over to get on the swing before her.

My friends sweet little 2 year old was trying to bring a chair over to sit next to me, my niece goes over and tries to rip it out of her hands so she can take it. She almost smashed this chair in this poor girls face.

More often than not my niece pulls this when her mom isn't around. In the past when myself or even my mom were watching her and have had to reprimand her (firm talking to, taking a break from playing etc), as soon as my cousin comes to pick her up or gets back from wherever she instantly starts bawling and trying to make herself be a victim. 

Like I have never witnessed a child like this.

My cousin as a child was similar in her behavior, but not as bad and I literally had nothing to do with her until we were young adults. It was easier because I was 6 years older. 

Our girls are the same age and do have good times but I have had to greatly reduce their time spent together because my daughter was starting to pick up her bad habits.

My cousin needs a sitter tomorrow so I offered. She would do it for me.

Hoping you can help/provide suggestions. 

My 2 year old used to be a great sleeper where we would literally place her in her cot and walk out and that would be her until morning. 

However she had to stay in a bed at her grandparents for a week and since then now needs us to sit with her whilst she falls asleep. 

That’s not the end of the world but the issue is now she is waking up almost every night in complete hysterics screaming to go to the lounge and the only thing that calms her is relenting and getting up with her and watching a film then eventually she will drop asleep in the sofa (she can be awake for up to 4/5 hours). We’ve tried calming her, letting her cry out a bit, lying next to her. Giving her a hug. Reading stories etc but we’re all out of ideas and can’t be getting up every night. It’s not good for any of us. She has a routine of bed, bath, calm play and then stories every night

Did anyone else go through this? And how did they get over it?

From day one we’ve established a good nighttime routine which I think has helped tremendously. Part of that routine is he gets a bottle in bed (*GASP) when we put him down. We’ve recently switched from bottles to sippy cup and it’s been working just fine. Usually give him a watered down sippy cup of milk (around 6 oz). I know this is 100% against “the rules” but it’s just worked for us (husband and I) and given us the most amount of sleep, which is especially important since we both also have full time jobs. 

Lately he’s been waking up around 4am screaming which is very unusual. Not sure if it’s nightmares or teething (or combo of both), but after 45 mins+ of screaming we cave and go into his room to change him and give him another 4-6oz of watered down milk. He goes back to bed within minutes.

- Has anyone else dealt this this or do this? All of my mama/parent friends said they’ve NEVER given a bottle in bed. Kind of a shitty feeling and makes me feel like we’re not doing a good job

We were late to attempting to sleep train my now 3yo because he has never been on the growth chart and was too tiny for sooooo long. (He’s still only 23 lbs.) 

I’ve periodically tried sleep training over the last two years (allll the kinds) but never with much success. 

We recently tidied up his bedtime to be earlier (7:30-8), and shorter. Shower, then snack time in the kitchen, three books then two minutes singing while he’s in bed then a kiss goodnight and he stays in bed... is the goal anyway. We also added a tiny bit of melatonin. 

He’s been doing pretty good with that, although we are sliding back into him getting rocked to sleep or mostly to sleep. 

The middle of the night is a total nightmare though. He wakes me up around 12:30 am to put him back to sleep and then again around 4. Then he sleeps until 5:30 or 6 at the latest. (Older brother usually wakes up too early at 5:30 and wakes us all up moving around.) 

On worse nights he could be up every 1.5-2 hours. 

That’s literally a way to torture someone, and it’s been going on for three years. I’m exhausted, no energy, and very very grouchy.

She’s always surrounded by cousins and playmates almost the same age as her. Some older cousins seem to take advantage of her being younger and can’t run as fast so they just take whatever toy she’s holding when they want it. 

When they’re at home visiting, of course all toys at home belongs to my daughter, they still do the same. So I told them “no, you can’t have this at the moment as she is playing with it. You can ask if she can share her toys and you should also accept when she says no.” This was in front of my husband (who is the one related to the cousins as I don’t have a family or friends of my own here in Germany) and my in-laws heard this as well. 

They always tell my daughter to share, which is totally fine of course, but maybe treat her as you would treat a normal person and respect her decisions when she says no? Especially when it’s her toys. Because in my opinion, if you force her to share her toys not only do you disregard her feelings, you also teach the other kids to just get it because “sharing is caring” and they don’t learn how to move on when they are told no. 

My daughter is 2 and can already understand. I ask if she can share with me her food or toys NICELY all the time. I say thank you when she does and I say ok when she doesn’t want to share. I think it’s about respect. She’s a kid but doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve it. 

Also, when it is us visiting her cousins, it’s the same. When they don’t want to share, I tell my daughter to find other toys to play with. She cries, yes, but she’s gonna learn that it’s not hers and if the owner doesn’t want her to borrow it she can’t.

I won't rehash here but we have tried literally everything (including a different bedroom) and here's where I need help because my regular moms groups haven't seen anything like it.    


If we cut naps completely, and only do quiet/rest times, she will go to bed at bedtime with a minimum of fuss.  She is asleep by 8 -9pm, or 9:30 at the latest.  (I can't tell you how long this has been a battle) and this has been consistent for over a week, so we're pumped.  (If there's a nap of any significant length, especially in the afternoon, she will battle us at bedtime until 11PM or later, then everything is thrown off for a couple days)   


Problem is, she will wake up around 5 nights a week between 1AM and 3AM, and will not be able to get back to sleep for a minimum of 3 hours.  Then she sleeps another 3-5 hours.    


Does anyone have any advice for a child that has difficulty going back to sleep?  Especially when she's clearly tired and will truly lay still or be rocked for hours upon hours.  I've tried milk, diaper changes, cycling her through quiet play, rocking, and laying with her, my partner and I trade off...nothing decreases the time below 3 hours for her to get back to sleep.

This is how we initially trained her. She had a few accidents on the carpet for a  week or so then she got the idea. Adding underwear to the mix has proven..... unsuccessful. This child HATES it if anyone is near her (a trait she gained from me. 12 years together and my wife has seen me pee only about 4 or 5 times) So the child loathes that you assist her. When she has either a pullup or a pair of training underwear she treats them like diapers and just goes in them. She will even pull the underwear off herself after going in them, So I KNOW she knows how to take them off.

It’s the only time I feel like I’m having a nice time with her and enjoying her company.

She’s just fucking crazy. She has been way above average activity levels since before she was even born. She was walking and climbing around the time most kids her age were just starting to crawl. At baby classes, she would be literally running around the room while her peers sat nicely in their moms laps. She doesn’t stop. She loves to scream. All she ever wants to play and do are super physical activties. The first thing she says to me in the morning is “go outside?” 

She doesn’t listen even though she understands. She’s defiant. She thinks it’s funny to be bad. She will do the exact thing I tell her not to while *screaming* “DON’T [thing she’s doing]”  She’ll ask for a food, I’ll give it to her, and even though I know it’s something she likes, she’ll spit it out and say ew because she thinks it’s funny. She’s aggressive and violent. She pulls hair and kicks and thinks it’s funny to hit. When I make her say sorry she says it with the most shit eating grin you can imagine.

I always feel sorry for myself. I just want a normal child. Sometimes I feel so genuinely amazed and perplexed at people with two kids, all those people who around 1 or 1.5 decided they could grow their families an add another.. HOW?? Then I remember they have fucking normal children.

He likes to evaluate people’s food choices and tell them they’re “wow so healthy” or “you probably should put some of that back”. One time he told an overweight woman that she “probably doesn’t need more cupcakes, you can have a banana if you want a treat”. I don’t know where this comes from because I’ve never discussed the link to unhealthy food and being overweight with him and the topic only comes up in the grocery store. If he sees someone buying chicken or fish he yells, “hey!! Hey you!!! Did you know someone cut that fish/chicken’s head off?” He loves telling people about the head being cut off, he thinks they don’t know this and he’s genuinely providing them new and useful information. He is very social and will try to start conversations with everyone and anyone, about anything. Yesterday I was bagging my groceries while an elderly man was bagging next to us. Suddenly I hear, “HEY OLD MAN!” I turn around give some the look and say “stop”, but he does it again. Then he looks at me and shouts “THIS OLD GUY’s EARS ARE BROKEN LIKE GRANDMAS HE DOESN’t KNOW IM TALKING TO HIM”. I explain if he wants to talk to someone he should say excuse me first and ask their name, not call them things like “old man”.... “EXCUSE ME OLD MAN! WHAT IS YOUR NAME?” The guy finally realizes he’s the one my son is yelling at and says “I’m peter, nice to meet you”. Son: “HI PETER, NICE TO MEET YOU TOO, DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY VERY OLD?”. I turned around and scolded my son, Peter thought I was scolding him (he obviously was pretty deaf), anyways it was extremely awkward. Peter left and as he was walking away son yells at the top of his lungs “BYE PETER! I HOPE I SEE YOU AGAIN SOON! MOM, PETER MIGHT DIE BEFORE WE SEE HIM AGAIN. HES REALLY OLD” Now I’ve given up and am just throwing shit into the bags as fast as possible as everyone is staring at us. I’m ignoring my son so he starts looking for someone else to talk to.

It's at the point where he'll laugh or will tell me he'll make me snake soup. We've also talked about serious things like death and getting hurt and as far as I can tell, he understands those fairly well.

He's been learning about the solar system at school and last night, his aunt told him that the sun will eventually be sucked in by a black hole or it will run out of gas, thus ending life on earth. This is fine, it's all real, we have been reading lots of planet/solar system books to him too. He nodded and we thought nothing more of it.

Come 10:19pm he came out of his room in TEARS telling me, ""mama I don't want the sun to be sucked into a black hole. I don't want the sun to run out of gas"" So of course I had to comfort him.

The easiest thing would have been to lie and told him that's not happening, but that's not our style so the real struggle began. I thought about telling him that it's not gonna happen in his lifetime but I didn't want tonight to be the night for him to have another existential fear about death even though we've talked about it before. It was hard to explain to him the concept of millions and millions of years b/c he thinks 100 is the largest number ever. 

After a while I settled on ""everything comes to an end someday, but the sun disappearing will happen far away in the future and for now, you are safe with mommy and daddy. I'm here for you"" and then I patted him to sleep. (I did stutter through most of it, so it's not nearly as smooth as I have it in my head, but it was enough to convince him)

Like, I think I did OK. Funny thing is all this time I've prepared myself for the social issues talks but completely forgot that there are a million other things that scare kids. It reminded me of when I was five and I accidentally put foot cream on my nose and my classmates told me the doctors will have to cut off my nose and it TERRIFIED me. I still remember the nightmare of being cut apart like a steamed egg (popular dish in China). And when I finally got the courage to ask my dad he completely blew me off. So 30 years later a small part of me still thinks my nose will get cut off.

I'm afraid she is not getting the calories she needs to gain a bit of weight, she has been at the same weight for over 2 months. Her current schedule is:

7:30 small bowl of oatmeal with whole milk and some blueberries or currants 

10:00 banana

12 noon vegetable parantha or dosa with dal, some yogurt and bit more fruit

1-2 nap

5:30 small snack, usually dates, cashews, almonds etc. small handful

7:00 veggie khichdi, some more yogurt, sometimes a few slices apple

This is literally the most she will eat in a day. If I try to sneak in anything else, the next meal goes for a toss. Even if I add a dollop of butter to everything, it still wouldn't add up to 1000-something calories that are recommended. She doesn't drink any milk or juice.

The doctor manipulated her arm and said she heard it “pop” back into place. Told us to take her home and keep her comfy overnight but that she should be back to normal the next day. 

Well, overnight was rough. A lot of crying and not a lot of sleeping. Today my daughter still says her arm hurts and she won’t move it. We made an appointment with her pediatrician at noon just to see if maybe she needs her arm readjusted again? 

But does anyone have experience with this? The articles we read and what urgent care said was that she should feel better and be getting back to normal by now. Is it possible she is just scared to move her arm after being in pain yesterday? I’ve tried to get her to grab things with that hand but she refuses to move the arm on her own or even walk around.

But...it hasn't gotten better. She tells us it's because she's ""not paying attention"" and she genuinely seems sorry, some of the time. When she's home we remind her to go every couple of hours, and she always fights us.

We've tried a reward chart which worked for a bit and then she seemed to stop caring. And now we are using a consequence chart (every accident gets an x, five x's and she loses a predetermined toy).

She also gets a special snack if she comes home from daycare with no accidents.

As of last week he still had a bottle of milk just before bedtime and two bottles at night. 

Two days ago we decided to drop the night feeds because of two reasons. 

First, he already has 13 teeth and I’ve read that nighttime bottle feeds can cause tooth decay.

And second, he really likes food, is open to try anything new and not picky, but eating not very much as he’s having more than 400 ml (14 oz) of milk at night, so there is no reason at all for him to increase the amount of food he eats.

Night weaning itself is working surprisingly well. First night he was whining and moaning for about 20 to 30 minutes at 4 am, after that slept till his normal wake up time.

Tonight he stirred and whined for 2 - 3 minutes a couple of times, but again slept till wake up time.

I’m very happy about this! But here is my problem.

Since yesterday he ate very little and refused to have breakfast altogether this morning. He just had half a piece of toast and very little of a fruit pouch as a snack before his first nap.

I’m very worried he isn’t eating enough but I don’t want to fall back on bottles.

Has anyone else gone through similar experiences? Any tips or tricks to get your child to eat?

A bit of background to explain my son’s nature incase anyone is able to offer any advice if their kids are similar....

So as like most toddlers, my son is REALLY active. He is 21 months now. When he was younger, mostly when he first started walking (around 1 years old) I always said I probably wouldn’t need to use any kind of toddler harness as I vowed I would try to ‘teach’ him now to walk nicely next to me. I had visions of us strolling together down the road hand in hand calmly within the first few months of him learning to walk. This was very short lived or more that I had skipped a couple of years in my head past the 18month+ stage all the way to perhaps the 5 year old stage. Plus he is the kind of little boy who literally just runs EVERYWHERE without any cautiousness or care for anything! (A cousin of his around the same age is the complete opposite - he will wait for his mum or be cautious to go anywhere without her, I guess it’s just down to individual personality!)

In the past week he has become so difficult to walk with on the road or even in a shopping centre and also has started to throw tantrums if he’s trapped in his stroller for a period of time, mostly because he wants to get out and walk himself. He doesn’t EVER really walk and only runs, to the point where even a fast paced walk is not enough to keep up with him, I now have to jog. He’s also SO quick and I worry he will get himself into danger or hurt himself. He doesn’t want to hold my hand (he never really does!) and I’m actually quite terrified to do this anyway because he will pull the other way - a few months ago he had ‘pulled elbow’ (the nurse said he probably is more prone to getting it in future too and to be careful.) He doesn’t like to listen much to me/doesn’t yet have the understanding of danger/gets so distracted and excited by being able to walk free somewhere. I want him to experience walking and seeing the world on his own legs, but in safest way possible.

We were given one of those bags which has a harness attachment as a gift and have tried it, but it just isn’t cutting it.

What sort of car should we be looking at to get the necessary amount of space to be comfortable? In the UK, crossover SUVs  seem to be very popular, but when I look at them on the road they don't really look any bigger than my car, just taller. We don't want a huge SUV, but wouldn't rule out a medium-sized one if it would be big enough to be comfortable. It seems like estate cars (called station wagons in North America?) aren't really fashionable any more, but that they might be the answer. Would the estate version of Golf be long enough, or should we be looking at something like a Passat Estate? I'm just sticking to VW here for ease of comparison - I'm not brand loyal.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on how comfortable they find their cars with two child seats in them.

He is now 15 months and will be joining the 12-24 month old room, which is a lot more structured. I have a few concerns:

1. He is not walking yet- I'm wondering how the interactions with other kids will be when he is crawling and they are all walking?

2. He currently takes 2 naps (morning and afternoon) at home, but they will be on a 1 nap schedule. We have tried a 1 nap schedule at home and it has gone poorly.

3. The biggest thing I feel ashamed to admit - we still rock our son to sleep for his naps and for bed. He also sleeps in a sleepsack, in his dark room with a sound machine. Obviously the majority of this cannot be replicated at daycare.

For background, we started potty training our 22 month old a little over 2 weeks ago (mostly using the “Oh Crap!”method). The first 3-4 days were really tough (for me, mostly) but then it really started to click. Since he’s still pretty young, he needs help with his pants, but with our help he is using the potty successfully at home with few to no accidents, and he is able to hold it and stay dry for small outings to the park, grocery store, etc. 

So, the problem is he will NOT use the potty outside of the house. I’m impressed with how well he can hold it, but also worried. I’ve tried taking him in public restrooms a few times, and we always bring the potty in the car with us. I have him sit on it whenever we get somewhere and before we leave. I try to keep it low pressure and just give him the opportunity, but he never takes it. I once tried to make him stay on the potty until he peed- he sat there for a full 1/2 hour singing and talking about trains...no pee. Twice now he has had an accident in his car seat on the way home when we are out for too long (Today we were out for about 2 hours, offered the potty 3 times, and he peed AND pooped his pants in his car seat on the way home- about 10 minutes after he sat on his potty 😭).

&amp;#x200B;

My 4 year old son (almost 5) had a stroke during labor. He technically has a diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. Much like adult stroke victims, he does not have any real mobility control of his left hand or left arm. He also has some issue with mobility with his left leg but to a much lesser extent. He had a brain scan done when he was about 1 years old when we found out the diagnosis. Pretty much all of the damage is on the left side of his brain, that controls movement. The language, emotions, and intellectual side of the brain was not damaged (this at least is how the doctors explained it to us). He has perfect verbal skills for his age and is actually very smart. He is social and loving with others and has many friends at school. He expresses emotions correctly. He is, by all accounts, a beautiful and friendly smart little boy. Most people have no idea there is anything wrong with him until they notice that he doesn't use his left arm. In school he is in regular K4 classes and does great. He goes to physical therapy and occupational therapy to try to help him use his arm more. He is also learning how to use things around his disabilities like how to do certain things one handed etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago though we noticed he has a problem. We got a switch and he is able to play it with the individual controller and his good hand. He loves Mario Party, Mario Kart, Kirby etc. I mean....he's obsessed. But we noticed he \*cannot\* for the life of him sit still while playing. He wiggles about, writhes, kicks his feet etc. He runs around all over the place almost frantically. The worst part is that he wants to be in your lap while you play together, but two seconds later he's back up again, then back in your lap, then back up again etc. He also claims ""I'm so cold!"" so you put him under the blanket on the sofa but two seconds later he's off the sofa again bouncing around but saying ""Mommy I'm cold! I need the blanket!"" and its like....you were under the blanket but you got out not even ten seconds later! When he is in your lap, he does these constant mico movements that are almost like repeated muscle contractions like he can't help but fidget. He also jumps on the sofa when you're playing games together. But its almost like compulsive because you will say ""Stop jumping"" and he will say ""Ok"" but not even five seconds later, he's jumping again. You say ""Didn't I say no jumping?"" and he will go ""OK mommy sorry"" and then not three seconds later he's jumping again. But its seriously like he doesn't even realize he's doing it, its just like a compulsive thing for him that he just does without even realizing he's doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing is that he often talks over my husband and I when we try to talk. I know thats normal toddler behavior but he just says the same things over and over again. And this is the other big part of that issue- ""Hey mommy. What can we do? Mommy. What can we do today. Hey mommy. Mommy. Hey Mommy."" ""WHAT?"" ""I love you"" ""He says some variation of this probably a thousand times a day.Hearing ""hey mommy"" is starting to make me want to rip my hair out. Because he rarely actually WANTS anything. ""Hey mommy, can I have a snack?"" is fine. ""Hey mommy can you help me go potty"" is fine. But it's always just ""Hey mommy.......hey mommy......"" and then some nonsense like ""What can we do"" or when he can tell I'm getting aggravated he switches to ""Hey mommy, I love you"" because he thinks I can't get mad if what he's saying is ""I love you"". My husband was on the computer last night and I was trying to watch TV while he was watching videos on his iPad. Absentmindedly he said ""Hey mommy, what can we do"" and I said ""Well you're watching videos and then its time for bed"" about one minute later he said ""Hey mommy......mommy.....mommy.....what can we do....."" and I said ""I just said after videos we can go to bed"".....not even a minute later ""Hey mommy...."" to which I snapped and shouted ""WHAT????"" because I had been hearing it for hours at this point. He said ""Mommy....I love you"" which of course made me feel like a jerk for snapping at him. I said ""I love you too buddy"". NOT EVEN TWO MINUTES LATER he goes ""Hey mommy..........I love you......"" like he hadn't just said that. My husband came around from the computer room and was like ""I can hear you just repeating yourself for no reason other than to bother mommy!""

&amp;#x200B;

Its driving me up a wall and I'm wondering if this is normal toddler behavior? The thing is, we are always on the look out for signs that he might have any special needs mentally because its a possibility that this can happen as he gets older. The other thing is that these behaviors feel like compulsions. Its like.....he has to say something, even if its nothing at all, he has to says something just to say something but its not just regular toddler chatter because its just the same handful of things over and over (usually, what can we do, or I love you, but always prefaced with the drawn out 'hey mommy' first).

I don’t think we are being overly mean, but her reactions are making me think twice. She will instantly tear up with big tears and start crying like she’s hurt. And to be clear right off the bat, we aren’t touching her or yelling during these interactions. 

Here’s an example: 
Last night she is sitting with me at our high top kitchen table. Now, I hate this table because she’s so wiggly and about falls off every time we sit there. But it’s the older table of our two and takes toddler abuse better than our dining room table. We have tried talking to her about sitting still and that she could get hurt, but you know, toddlers don’t care. So she’s sitting there being all wiggly and about falls off but catches herself last minute. She was obviously caught off guard and I told her in a stern voice to be careful and sit still. I probably shouldn’t have been stern, but I had already asked 10 times and she was NOT listening. She instantly starts tearing up and crying. But crocodile tears that just kept flowing. 

Is this normal? I don’t know why lately this is her response. I know she’s testing boundaries but her reactions seem disproportionate with how we are correcting her. Should we be changing our response for correcting her? When we ask nicely or try to make it a choice, she just smiles slyly and keeps doing what she wants to do. I wouldn’t mind dealing with this once in a while but lately it’s any time we have to correct her or ask her to stop doing something dangerous. Like falling off chairs, trying to touch the stove, etc.

I am having so much trouble with my 3 year old and sleep. He sleeps through the night just fine, but getting him to sleep is the problem. Most nights it takes him 1-1.5 hours to fall asleep. I heard it should only take 20-30 min for a toddler to fall asleep and I dont know what to do to help with that. I feel like ive tried everything and if something does help, it only works for a week or so and then he struggles to fall asleep again. The only way I've really gotten him to fall asleep without any problems is if he's up until 11-12am (which is way to long for him to be up especially with no naps).

We tried switching him to a real bed and he would never stay in bed and thats when it usually took the longest to fall asleep - some nights it would take 3 hours to get him to sleep and the only way he would stay in bed is if someone was in there with him, which was fine but I didn't want to make a habit of it bc I was pregnant and didn't know how that would work with a newborn. I know transitioning him takes time but even after 7-8 months it never seems to get any easier.

We switched him back to a crib shortly before the baby was born bc nothing seemed to help. That obviously kept him in bed, but he still has trouble falling asleep. I feel like somewhat of a failure bc he should be in a real bed by now but I just cant keep up with putting him back to bed for hours and trying to put the baby down.

Now that the baby is easier to get to sleep and sleeping longer, I feel its time to try and switch him to a real bed again but I just don't know what to do. He's also said a few times he wanted to sleep in the big bed vs his crib so idk maybe now he's ready? He doesn't take naps anymore bc he wont fall asleep and if he does it makes bedtime even harder bc he seems to have so much more energy. We tried multiple different routines but they never seem to last, like no TV 3 hours before bed, no sweets before bed, no electronics before bed, etc. We tried this bubble bath and lotion that had lavender, chamomile and melatonin in it. I've tried diffusing lavender and chamomile oils in his room and putting it on his pillow. Right now the routine we are doing is a bath shortly after dinner and then get dressed/brush teeth and then stories and then bed..he never seems scared in his room just seems like he can't fall asleep and I also feel bad just leaving him up there for hours to fall asleep.

I'm not sure what to try anymore, one thing I noticed is if he's in bed by 7pm he falls asleep pretty quick compared to normal. But then after a few days or so he was waking up around 4am, sometimes 2. Im not sure if i should start trying to give him naps again, idk if he's just overtired and fighting it. Im not sure if I just have to keep sticking to the same routine even after he goes back to having trouble falling asleep, maybe after a few weeks it will start to get better/shorter? Im not sure anymore how to help him bc I feel like I've tried it all. It just seems to make it hard on him when he's falling asleep late but waking somewhat early (early compared to the time he fell asleep) and then refusing to nap and then also refusing to sleep.

We have a very nice Montessori school (k3-8) that’s walkable from our house, the only issue is that it’s highly sought after and everyone is accepted via lottery. The only way to avoid the lottery is by having an older sibling in the school or by signing up for their toddler program. 

The toddler program is for 2.5-3 year olds (so he would be starting next September). It’s 3 hours/day and it’s $800.00 month.  

The issue: this year feels like a wasted year because of covid. I had envisioned us going to play groups, music classes, library classes, gymnastics... all things we used to do precocious and now can’t do because of the virus. I feel cheated because I won’t be able to do any of those classes if he enrolls in the toddler program next year (they are all morning weekday classes). 

What would you do? Should I keep him home another year so we can do all these mom and me classes and try to get him in through the 3k lottery in the 22-23 school year? Or should I sign him up for the toddler class next year (21-22 school year) so I know he’ll have a spot.

He will only be going 2 days a week. Classes are cut in half. Teachers wears masks. Kids it’s optional. So far, he’s gone one day, and is already sick 😬 AFTER ONE DAY. He was in school last year until March and was sick off and on constantly, which I expected. But of course, with covid, now I’m concerned I may have made the wrong decision sending him back already. I knew he’d get sick but not this fast! 

I understand it’s an inherited risk sending him back, but I’m trying to weigh both his and my mental health as well (I had to stop working to take care of him for the past 6 months the we quarantined). He has been desperate to be around other kids again (as I’m sure all kids are at this point). He’s an only child and has taken to mostly terrorizing our cat. But his dad and I need to work (we own our own business). We’ve gotten busier and my husband needs help. And I WANT to work. I am not the type that can do the SAHM thing full time. I’ve been doing it for 3 years and I need the mental stimulation of work. 

I had him with a nanny for the past month, but she could only give him so much of what he needs socially. Plus she works at a restaurant and is young, so who knows what she’s up to. I don’t feel like having her come is a particularly lower risk of exposure. 

Plus my son was so happy when I picked him up last week from school. Like beaming from ear to ear. But shit! It’s like I can’t win. Send him back, possibly get covid. Don’t send him back, he’s semi miserable as am I. 

I tried to form a “pod” and it was a logistic nightmare. Finding a teacher was imposible too. They all wanted like 70-80/hour for 3-4 kids and full time jobs. So that fell apart quickly. Plus getting the parents on the same page was impossible. I wasted a month of time trying to make it happen. 

Finally found this preschool. Maybe I just need to make him wear a mask at school? I know some kids are and some are not. 

On top of this, and I know I’m going to get flak for this, I have a compromised immune system (Crohn’s disease), so apparently I’m higher risk? I guess. I haven’t had a flare in 6 years because I follow a strict diet and have been super healthy since. But I wonder how my body would and could deal with covid if I got it. Who knows.

1. On mobile so I apologize for the format. 
2. My first post
2. TDLR; I am closely connected with “Blippi” but the person, &amp; I have gotten hate for it, fake people who have tried to use my close connection, my son is going to be in a few new videos &amp; I am creeped out I have my friends merchandise, especially the doll of my childhood friend! 

 
So I truly did grow-up with “Blippi”, &amp; closely, not just acquaintances! I am not only from the same town in central WA, but he is actually a great friend of mine! He was a grade below me, &amp; was one of my brothers best friends, and his sister (his only sibling) was a grade ahead of me! She was a good friend, but we drifted apart due to different social paths, but we remained and are good! He actually had a HUGE crush on me! I have love letters from him, and in my yearbooks he used to purposely make my brother mad by telling me in detail why he liked me! His loves letters are also VERY FUNNY! He was always funny, and he was always wanting to make people laugh, but he was also made fun of by older peers...who is laughing now as their kids are all addicted to his show, &amp; are forced to line his pockets with his merchandise! I’m literally SURPRISED that nobody has once sold him out by a large media outlet for money! We have that type of hometown (I literally know of 3 peers who went on Dr. Phil-1 was a made up story) as they are also the people who literally have maybe only gone to Seattle (maybe 90 minutes away) a handful of times and think it’s some HUGE, and crazy big city?! It’s not, luckily I have a parent who has always lived there so I was exposed to more than my peers! I have also lived downtown for years now, &amp; it’s kinda a small place. But due to the things known it’s actually weird as I just thought of it while I am writing this! 

So he’s changed his name spelling, and he has made his life and history, ESPECIALLY in regards to his family to protect them. I personally know why and this has brought me into some of the most bizarre situations, 90% online! This WHY I could see someone to sell something to the media for money...sad. 

I am in A LOT of mom groups online! Especially larger ones, &amp; the bigger groups are all connected to one main group, I don’t want to say the name of the main group, but it’s got like 30+ sub-groups. Whenever I mention it, which I only admitted it once in one of the more drama base groups (they each are on a drama spectrum; and some have men too). 
Ugh... I got INTERROGATED more than I have about other things that are actually a lot more interesting or could be accused of being unreal! Most people who had CLEARLY done some serious digging into him to know things most people who aren’t even in the same age bracket for our hometown to know?! Most were all cool but I got hated on too. Especially when I didn’t discuss details of his family. Which I won’t now either, and I know why he has gone to a lot of effort to hide his family!  Wow I showed an email exchange and I had blocked his more personal info out but enough to know I wasn’t lying it was FINALLY all doubters were cool about, and I of course had some random haters for me just knowing someone &amp; proved it was real! 

I have more than the contact information that proved us to be close, that’s way more personal information which I won’t share. He did thank me privately in another separate exchange via text as I was explaining the story initially, &amp; he was like,
“Yeah...sorry [insert my name] those are probably the same moms that send me nudes, videos and mail me panties! They even mention their kids names asking me for stuff or just are horny bored moms!” 
So when he sent me back an email kinda taking a shot at the moms who cyberstalk him, including the mean hater moms (the most) it was kinda justice! This was awhile ago &amp; I NEVER thought it would follow me online? 

I have since had people who either remember that stupid thread, or followed haters online for a bit, and then I will get like 1-2 random random moms PM’ing from all over asking me if it’s true I am “the girl from [Insert Mom Groups Name(s)] that is friends with Blippi?” And ask if I can get free stuff, his info, a sad story of why their child’s life would change by him personally doing SOMETHING, and then the other moms who want to be in a video. Those video request ones, they ALWAYS seem to know before he has a video setup to film pretty far ahead, I have no idea how? Which is almost always then met with “my child is so much better than yours to be in one!” Ummm, RUDE! Plus he hasn’t been able to do one yet?! He’s literally asked me about it because my brother, who was so close to him, well he passed away their senior year, and my son happens to look IDENTICAL to him! Which my brother I’m referring to as I have more than one (5 total) often were assumed to be twins! But still, I can’t believe that 1 random comment from over a year ago has caused me to get my child hated on and they typically have somehow found me on IG which I am SUPER careful with privacy stuff on social media due to my sons father &amp; having a protective order for my son and I.

Like to help them sleep? It seems to help my little boy a whole heck of a lot, but honestly I was extremely sleep deprived when it occurred to me to try it, and, thinking on it now, the tones won’t hinder his brain development in any way, right? I don’t see how they could, but I’m not a scientist. Please no judgment, just curious about what everyone thinks about this.  I’ve done a little searching online but can’t find any articles specifically pertaining to children.

**Some background: my son is 17 months old. I suspect he might have ADD like me (though who knows rn. But, genetics, so I’m mindful) He would probably stay up all night if we let him... a night owl with boundless energy. As for me, I literally cannot sleep without an eye mask and binaural beats in my earbuds. As a young child, I was an insomniac too, a common problem for people with ADHD (my parents still speak of the “years they went without sleep”) Anyway, now that my boy has this white (well, “brown”) noise playing in the background at night, when he wakes up, after midnight usually, my partner just gives him a bottle in his crib, not even picking him up. The boy drinks it, throwing it away when he’s done. Falls back asleep. Magical. He even slept through the night once last week (!!) So, I can see it’s working fairly well BUT it goes without saying, if it’s hurting him in the long run, it’s not worth it. Not to mention, I can just play the brown noise setting without the isochronic tones underneath it. I’m sure it would still help... 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Tl;dr ;; are isochronic tones safe for babies to listen to while they sleep at night? 

If he is getting more sleep than he was before, I feel it’s probably benefitting him not harming him. Any insight from other parents is extremely appreciated.

FYI I use the AmbiSci100P app that’s available on the App Store, &amp; the Sleep-Deep HP/SPK setting with Brown Noise, if anyone feels their child would benefit (or even yourself) There are tons of free apps like that one available on both stores.

Stressed-out mom of a freshly two-year old boy here. We're trying the Oh Crap method and failing miserably. 3 says in and each day has seen a touch more improvement than the last, but that's really not saying much. I'm talking 2.5 pees and 1.3/2 poops made it into the potty today, and countless pees made it onto the floor. He pees (and sometimes starts pooping) on the floor constantly. A small, lightning-speed puddle will appear, he'll shout, ""Pee!"" then run around until our cries to get to the potty lead him to sit down. Then.... Nothing. He doesn't finish the pee. Ever. Not a drop. So we wait, we gently tell him how nice it would feel/be to let the pee out, and we read books or play with him while he sits on the potty. He will sometimes help us clean up, but usually we're more focused on trying to get him to finish the pee rather than make more of a mess. 

I've never seen someone with such bladder control that he can go 10, 15, 20 minutes at a time without a drop. Then he'll get up, take a lap around the room, and produce another small puddle for us to start the process over again with. I can even tell he really has to go from holding it so long, but the potty doesn't seem to do anything but shut everything up tight. The times he does go, even if it's just a drop, we're always sure to praise him and give him high-fives, and his face lights up. (We don't really want to go down the road of using other rewards.) But this isn't apparently enough to learn how to release his urine on purpose on the potty. Or does this sound like a behavior issue? My husband and I are at his wit's end, and on Monday when the workweek starts, I'll be all on own again.

I’m new here and this is my first time posting. My son turned 2 on 08/03, I started to look into early intervention when he was a little over 18 months. He had a few words but not nearly what he was supposed to. We started with ABA (which wasn’t clarified until a couple of weeks ago, everyone kept referring to it as speech therapy) and he doesn’t love it. We started when everything was shutting down and have only done video calls, I’m doing the sessions with the therapist but everything seems to be a chore for him. 

Now, my main concern at the beginning was speech. They explained that the ABA needed to be the first step to ensure that he was able to sit down and pay attention during speech. We are in the process now of requesting speech and OT. 

Our therapist is a bit of an alarmist. Throughout the day he doesn’t behave like he does during the session, every little thing he does she comments about how she sees him having sensory issues and possibly stim (he crossed his fingers, avoids looking at me when I’m asking him to follow a command, and rocks back and forth trying to get out of the chair). I’m feeling very overwhelmed, I know that he doesn’t do any of that throughout the day but that’s all she sees during that hour. She mentioned that if I was to take him to a development pediatrician app he might end up diagnosed with autism. 

He plays pretend, has good eye contact throughout the day, imitated nursery rhymes and other things we do, gets excited when we’re going out and tries to put my shoes and he’s shoes on. Say bye and waves, can follow one step commands (turn light off, come or get out, sit, if you ask him to stop doing something he stops). 

He, however, avoids responding to his name. I say avoids because if I’m sitting facing him and say he’s name he’ll look. If my husband calls him he’ll look up but if he’s doing something and you call his name he won’t stop what he’s doing and look at you. She says that children he’s age are pleasers and he should be able to look up when he’s been called just to please us. 

Sometimes I look at him and I can see he’s behind, he’s never been around other children he’s age and has never been to daycare. A lot of the behaviors she sees and has mentioned do not happen when we’re out and about, he loves to be around other people. 

I know early intervention is great and the best thing we can do for him right now but I’m feeling very overwhelmed. I’m looking at him and almost trying to justify every little thing he does and it’s driving me nuts. His therapist did say once that if that wasn’t the behavior throughout the day that it was probably him being stubborn and wanting to be child-led instead of adult-directed. 

I wanted to see other’s experiences with the program. I don’t even know what a 2 year old should or shouldn’t be doing, kids are so different. When I called a few daycares to explain where he’s at right now, there response was that most 2 year olds are the same.

We are all good with night time sleep. We have a routine. It works well. She sleeps all night. No issues there.

But I cannot seem to get her to take her nap on her own. As in *I have to rock her to sleep* or she won’t sleep at all. If I let her fall asleep on her own she’ll take her nap waaaay to close to night time and then won’t sleep until 1-2am. Not only that but she turns into shehulk and I get nothing done around the house and end up angry and frustrated.

She is at the point were she only takes one nap, which is right after lunch at around 1:30-2:00. She takes a looong time to fall asleep, 15mins to 30mins of rocking. I’ve tried to just cuddle but she doesn’t like it, *I need to rock her.* She is 18 months and starting to get heavy and sometimes fights sleep (and she *is* sleepy!) and throws her head back and gives me bruises. 

I’ve tried to just let her not sleep at her usual time and let her take her nap when she becomes exhausted but I couldn’t do it past the week. She just becomes unbearable to me. That 1:30min to 2hr nap she takes in the middle of the days makes us both more happy...

But I’m tired of rocking her to sleep. My right arm seems to have a bruise on it all the time. I know I should cherish this. She won’t need me to rock her to sleep soon. But dear lord I’m tired of it. 

I can’t make her room dark to simulate night, her room has a long rectangular window on the very top that’s not reachable. I’ve tried mimicking her sleep time routine and it hasn’t worked.

First time poster here. I have a 2 year old son (2 years, 2 months) who is normally a good sleeper. Did minor sleep training around 9 months to cut out night feeds, but other than that, I have just worked very hard to instill good habit (both in him and in us as parents).

We always do his nighttime routine, which ends with Mom, Dad and toddler reading 2 books together, then a family hug and in to bed he goes. Usually, no fussing occurs and he’s asleep within 15 minutes. I have a white noise machine with a nightlight on it, which we use for naps and nighttime.

For the last week or so, he has started to scream and cry when we leave the room. We have always shut his door tight which was never an issue. I do not want to get in to the habit of laying with him until he falls asleep. Yesterday, he cried for mom and dad for 10 minutes. Dad went in and rubbed his back for about 2-3 minutes, then left. Once again, toddler cried for about 10 minutes, and eventually put himself to sleep. I’m not one to usually let him cry it out, and normally wouldn’t allow him to cry for more than 15 minutes.

Thankfully he is not (yet) waking in the night, but wakes up crying between 5:30 and 6. Normally he will sleep until 6:30 at the earliest, and then play quietly until we go get him around 7. 

He was moved to a toddler bed in early August as he was climbing out of his crib. We had a minor setback after that but it only lasted about a week.

I have read about nighttime fears, 2 year molars, and other things that can affect sleep. I’m sure this is normal! Just looking for some tips and tricks that have worked for other parents in order to avoid having to stay with him until he falls asleep.

In my house, at the moment, I have a few toddler hacks that have been working well for us! For reference my toddler is 18m! 

• [condiment cup, baby spoon &amp; plastic bib](https://imgur.com/a/EmVsy16) is a great way for toddler to learn to eat yogurt, apple sauce, and cereal independently. Sure there’s still a mess, sometimes multiple servings, but it’s been a good transition to independent eating with utensils for us! 

• [toddler shelf](https://imgur.com/a/JMSmjHv) in the fridge has been wonderful! We just started it, but all of her cups, and anything we would allow her to get on her own would be on this shelf! As she gets older this will no doubt have more on it and change, but again I think it’s a good start to some independence, especially because she’ll have a sister in roughly 2 months! So I’m trying to help her be independent where we can! 

•[bathroom sink stool ](https://imgur.com/a/OPhWJR4) an oldie, classic and a goodie. Just never thought I would use it on such a young toddler! She loves to wash her hands and brush her teeth so it’s been working great for us! 

•[Laundry Basket bathtub ](https://imgur.com/a/zJ07oi6) I don’t know where I found this, but it’s been awesome for our transition from infant tub to big bathtub! My daughter doesn’t like to sit all of a sudden so I feel a lot more comfortable with her being in a small contained space that she can have her own movements and exploration that isn’t the entire tub!

Indeed, we had been working on identifying the foods for about 10 min, and he showed absolutely no signs of wanting to devour anything. Anyway, so, I left the room to go grab my water from my bedroom, and when I came back, he had eaten about 1/3 of the banana... peel included (pic [here](https://imgur.com/a/nxnDh7n))🤦🏼‍♀️ He is obsessed with bananas, so I was surprised that he was completely unfazed by eating the banana peel.

Just after some commiseration / figuring out if this is normal or a phase.

Our 2.5 year old loves day care. He hasn’t had any extended break from it. However day care mornings are a STRUGGLE. He will be happy then I get him out to bed and he cries. Then I change his nappy and he is happy. Feed him breakfast he is happy. Put on shoes and he throws a fit because he knows he is leaving the house. Happy in the car. As soon as he sees day care he starts crying. We can’t go into the centre because of COVID so the carers take him crying from my arms. However during day he LOVES day care and has no issues. Then home time comes and he runs away from me and hides and cries when we take him home.



It’s just very disheartening - he cries when we take him TO day care and cries when he has to go home. Can’t make him happy either way. He has been a bit miserable from teething (2yo molars) but this is even outside of that because even with pain medication and being perfectly happy five seconds ago he starts clinging to me like a koala. I’m just not sure what to do or if it’s just a phase as it’s only started recently.


I give him plenty of pre warning in the morning, I try to give him space and time to play in the morning and not “rush” him and stress him out, in the afternoons we give lots of love and cuddles. 

It’s just hard to not be able to make him happy.

Any ideas? Or is it just an expression of his frustration at lack of choice / control?

He’s been going to the same day care since he was 8 months old, hasn’t had a break, and used to be absolutely fine on drop off and pick up up until a couple of months ago.

He does have some gaps - he goes Mon, Tues, Thurs. so I wondered if he’s suddenly gotten old enough to feel really disrupted with an odd routine?

He's up usually 2 times a night, and I'm currently giving him a small bottle of half milk half water for him to fall back asleep. I'm trying to get it down to just water, but he throws a screaming fit if there isn't at least a splash of milk. 

We have tried, it seems, everything-- we've done sleep training, from gentle methods (me staying in the room and soothing, etc.) to the cry-it-out method, straight from the Ferber book. It seems like we've been attempting sleep training of one kind or another for literally the past 2 years straight. When we do the full on cry-it-out method it works for like a week, and then he'll skip a nap and we're right back where we started with him waking up again, I'm assuming from being overtired. If he misses a nap he'll wake up at night. If he naps even 20 minutes too long or an hour too late in the day he'll wake up. If he's teething, has a cold, misses me at night, if the window is too open or too closed, or if his sister makes noises in the room next door he'll wake up.

He's speech delayed, and a total extrovert, so I know that part of it is the inability to get all of his energy out during the day when we're stuck at home due to COVID and also the inability to reason him back to sleep. I would do more cry it out, but  and his screaming wakes up his sister and my partner and and honestly, I don't think I can handle it anymore-- he is incredibly stubborn about it, and simply refuses to sleep if I'm not there, sometimes for literally hours. At this point the bottle seems the easiest way to just get him back in his bed, but I'm so tired of being awake for 20-30 minutes twice a night to do that. I'm exhausted. I try to take him in bed with me to just go back to sleep, but this just wakes him up more, and he'll be playing with the blankets, climbing everywhere. 

So, hit me with all of your tips, tricks, advice, literally anything. At this point I'm pretty sure I'll be sending him back to bed with a bottle when he's headed off to college. Help.

note that I am speaking here of a child who would be at least two or three years old, not an infant.

when changing a child's disposable diaper, I am right handed. therefore, are usually form a capital T shape between my body and the child. in other words, I will usually stand on one side of the bed/surface and the child will be lying perpendicular to me. since I am right handed, their head will usually be to my left, and their feet/toes will be pointed to my right side. so if you can picture this, when cleaning them, I lift their legs up into my left toward their chest.

I tend to find having them lying perpendicular to me it is a lot more comfortable for me.

I am told that a lot of parents/caregivers do not do it this way. my best friend actually has the child lying parallel to them. so, their head is facing away from them, and their toes are pointed straight out toward my friends chest. forming more of a straight vertical line shape.

I frequently got so frustrated with her clinginess that I lost my temper.  I was feeling stressed because I was expecting another baby, and wasn't sure how to cope with it all.  

I'm here to report that it got a lot better, and to give other moms with clingy kids some encouragement.  

The first year of my new baby's life was really hard.  My first child still wanted all of my attention.  My second was happy to play by herself or to flip through a book while on my lap, so my first child was successful in sucking up all my attention.  The only real memories I have of my second child's first year are from when my first kid was napping.   I'm really sad about this, to be honest.  But I'm not really sure what I could have changed.  My first child learned to recognize when I was about to lose my temper, and would leave me alone if I was about to blow (but not until then), but that tended to mean that my second kid walked into a primed bomb.  It was still kind of miserable, and I still felt like a bad mom.   
 
This all started to really change about 8 months ago.  My younger child got old enough to play with the elder, and it was amazing.  Now, my mornings consist of only intermittent interacting with my children, instead of constant haranguing, and I love it.  I also feel like I can give my second kid more attention, as I'm not constantly emotionally tapped out.

My younger kid's naptimes are the most difficult part of my day.  I've instituted ""Mommy's break time.""  The older is to leave me alone for an hour after the younger has gone to sleep, then we'll do something together.  This goes less well.  Often, she will sit next to me, bored, and attempt to get my attention.  She usually refuses to play alone.  I often have to send her to her room to get a true break.  

My elder child also balks at being away from the house without me.  She was upset with me for days after attending a friend's birthday party I didn't stay for, despite me telling her beforehand I was dropping her off.  I want to sign her up for a once a week program, but she says she doesn't want to be away from me.  It's frustrating.

I would say our relationship is still more difficult than I would like.  She still has really intense needs (wants?  It's hard to know.  I'm sure she perceived them as needs), and we still occasionally get into patterns where I feel smothered and she feels ignored, but I don't lose my temper anymore.  It's not because I changed, though that was what I was hoping for two and a half years ago, it's because the circumstances around me changed and made it easier to parent my challenging child.

It’s hard to “teach in the moment” when he’s off the rails like that, and after the fact he doesn’t seem to care? I know that sounds awful- but it’s like he’s like yeah whatever, mom lol

Example: His daycare has this amazing full size wooden train for the kids to play on- because of COVID it’s off limits and they just want parents to redirect the kids instead of putting up barriers. My son loves this train- LOVES IT. I get it, it’s not fair!!
His classroom is directly in front of this train and he knows it- when we go to leave he refuses to be carried because he can do it himself- he’ll hold my hand until we get to the door- then he BOLTS for the train.
If I hold his hand forcefully I’m afraid I’ll dislocate his arm because this boy is STRONG. So I do the best I can but he gets away.
I talk to him about it and try to get him to follow me out- it’s a hot mess and I’m embarrassed as my kid is SCREAMING and going boneless when I try to pick him up. I try again and he starts yelling “OW! OW OW OW OW OW!!”
I’m mortified- he’s never done this! I’m not hurting him, but I’m afraid people think iam since he’s yelling OW!
I manage to get him out of the daycare kicking and screaming to have him go boneless again so I put him down- he RUNS away laughing- I’m yelling STOP NO FREEZE like we’ve been talking about, but it’s now a game.
I finally get him and carry him to the car kicking and screaming- he’s trying to smack me/hit me/kick me in protest and I finally get him in the car seat.

so our daughter is coming 18months, that last couple weeks we've let TV into her schedule because she's exhausting, she seemed interested and also old enough.  Also, I saw a post here about several shows that are basically designed to help them learn before schooltime.

We let her have about 45minutes in the morning (which we've since removed due to our concerns in her behaviour.). She wants baby bum or dave and ava on youtube which is basically nursery rhymes.

While watching, her eyes are basically glazed over and she's not very responsive or interactive.  I definitely think it has helped with her learning of numbers etc but when it comes time to turn it off, she usually gets a warning or two about what's going to happen.  Usually we get a 'nooooo' or something and plough on.

This morning for example, she was crying, screaming no and generally writhing around.  She takes a bit of calming down and then is demanding milk from her mum (we're assuming this is for comfort because she's upset or that she's just lost watching tv and doesn't realise she's hungry.)

For his life, up until almost 3 months ago, he was eating, taking milk, growing and sleeping as expected. Almost 3 months ago he started becoming pickier at what he’d eat, so we tried new things, different things, favourite things, different colours, flavours and textures. 

As time has gone on his intake ha really dropped, he is slim, but that is expected, he has energy, no behavioural issues and even with a limit on milk intake doesn’t eat. For 2 weeks now he has not had more than 1/2 a cup of food for the whole day. He has been living virtually on sultanas, milk and crackers.

When he does eat other foods he generally just chews on them, turns them into a pulp in his mouth for a while then spits them out.

Do any other parents here have experience with their toddler possibly having a Sensory Processing Disorder? I would love to hear from other parents that have dealt with something similar and would love to know if you have any advice. I feel kind of lost.

My son is 18 months. I've known there was something going on with him since he was at least a year (his cousin of the same age was way more advanced in language, communication, and play) but his pediatrician at the time was about to retire and was very dismissive (I got the whole ""you're a first time mom, calm down, he's probably fine"" spiel). I got the same thing from family and tried to let things go and not worry. I brought up my concerns at his 15 month and the pediatrician we saw said it was too early to set up speech and language interventions and that all children develop at different rates. Anyway, fast forward to the 18 month check up- We'd since moved across the country and his new pediatrician immediately put through four referrals for evaluations for hearing, speech, OT, and to a developmental pediatrician. 

I'm happy that my son has a pediatrician that is taking things seriously, but man, this is overwhelming. I feel like we went from 0-60 all of the sudden. I spoke to a developmental pediatrician on the phone today and did a screener with her. She sounded pretty alarmed by some of my son's behaviors and she suspects he has some type of sensory processing issue (along with the speech and language delay). Me and my husband have been thinking the same thing and my husband has noise issues and I have some tactile issues, so it's not a huge surprise. There are certain sounds (like a cow mooing and certain harmonizing in songs) that make my son terrified. He also is obsessed with touching other children, which makes going to the playground hard in the midst of social distancing and it makes me really worried about his ability to make friends as he gets older. The issue at the moment is that all the various people we need to schedule evaluations with are booked out like crazy and hard to get ahold of. Also the developmental pediatrician wants us to find him some friends to play with but we're new to the area and are still in quarantine mode. I'm feeling kind of alone and would love to hear from other parents.

We did BLW (baby led weaning) with her at 6 months, giving her finger sized slices or cuts of whatever we were eating, just with slightly less salt. She did great and loved exploring new foods and flavors. She was always an amazing eater from then right up until she turned 2. I would just make her mini versions of whatever the rest of us were eating and she would never refuse anything. Fast  forward to her turning 2, seemingly overnight the only thing she wants to eat is French fries and noodles, occasionally chicken. She still will eat broccoli and corn, her favorite vegetables sometimes but she is pretty much refusing everything else she used to eat. She prefers to just snack which I give her relatively healthy snacks like tomatoes, cheese, fruits, and the occasional bowl of goldfish. I do not want to start cooking her something she will eat while the rest of the family eats something different or more complex. I don’t wanna get her stuck on like chicken nuggets and fries, which is the only thing my 9 year old sister will eat to this day. That is my worst nightmare. How can I broaden her pallet again?

The girl is quite physical and doesn't know fear. Firm words, stares or even occasional raising of voice has no impact on her. She and the boy have been fighting over every thing. She pushes him quite often and also hits him. Boy doesn't reciprocate ( at least with full conviction) because he knows we will punish him. 
Now, a while ago she pushed him from a chair and his head almost hit a sharp corner. Now I'm quite annoyed, but I can't do anything, if it was my son doing this I know the levers to push and make him regret his actions. With this girl I have no leverage and she continues to operate in this mode. 
I am quite disappointed and sad, I am thinking maybe I shouldn't invited her over again ( on one side) and on the other side thinking of giving punishments and building leverage on her ( I don't know if I have the authority of teaching somebody else's kids manners and even if so how far can I go).

I have a 22 month old daughter, and my wife is starting to be concerned that we will need to see a speech pathologist.  Currently, she is saying 23 words regularly, but has spoken many others either once or for a brief period of time.  She definitely understands what we are saying to her or asking her her to do, just doesn't seem to want to speak.  She is a very efficient at pointing to get to what she wants.

I think it may be a confidence thing.  If you ask her to say a word at normal volume, most often she doesn't try.  But if you whisper to her, you can see her trying to form the words with her lips and sometimes you can hear her trying to make the sounds.

Is this something that is to be expected?  Any advice on trying to get her to try more words?

Also a little concerned that I'm this excited about poop. 

My 3 year old has been resisting pooping in the potty for a while now. And he hates getting his butt wiped to the point that he was going out of his way not to tell us and just tried to poop in his shorts even though he was right in front of us.

We never thought it would end. It was painful and has lead to more than one power struggle.

But a few days ago we were at Target, and he saw a bag of M&amp;Ms and asked for them. I decided to use it as a motivational tool and told him we would get them, but he would only get M&amp;Ms when he pooped in the potty, 1 for trying, 5 for succeeding.

So today I was standing in the kitchen getting food for the cat when my husband and son come downstairs and my husband is telling our 3 year old he will give him an M&amp;M for sitting on the potty.

3 year old sits on the potty and gets an M&amp;M, then promptly decides one is not enough. So he asks for more and we tell him that he can't have any more until he poops in the potty.

Son disappears into the bathroom and my husband and I don't think much of it. I feed the cat and start filling the soda stream bottles when our son announces ""I pooped in the potty!""

I look at my husband skeptically and go to investigate and sure enough, there it is. An almost man-sized poop sitting in the toilet.

We were thrilled; we partied and 3 year old got way more than 5 M&amp;Ms. He is currently bouncing off the walls from all the sugar, but I truly feel like we finally hit a turning point with this whole potty training thing and I pray it continues to go this way. \*fingers crossed!\*",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,78332,public,self,3 year old FINALLY pooped in the potty!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/j1mh1a/3_year_old_finally_pooped_in_the_potty/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was reading an article discussing ways to build self esteem and confidence in our kids. Specifically for toddlers it explained that we shouldn’t discourage them from climbing and exploring (in appropriate locations like the park) due to our own fears. And the way they explained it has made a huge difference in both my toddlers’ (3&amp;4yo) within a week or less. So instead of discouraging them from climbing too high or attempting something they see the older kids do that might be too advanced, ask them what their plan is or, what are they going to do after they take another step higher. So I started doing this right away when my adventurous 3yo would get brave. I wouldn’t stop him, u would ask him “so you got up that high, now make a plan to get down. Then suggest places to put their feet and so on. This way of encouraging critical thinking has changed both of my kids entire outlook on life outside of home. And after they complete a big task without your help you could see the bells in their brains make the connection. They were so proud of themselves that they have implemented this “so what’s your plan?” Advice in other areas. It took maybe 4 trips to the park and my kids gained a sense of self confidence that i am so proud of. Since then the whining and unsure behavior has all but stopped. It has made my household a more calm place. I wish everyone the best.

Even when we’re at the park she has a hard time playing with others even when she tries. 

I’m mentioning this because I’m afraid it could’ve also effected her.. me and my s/o especially in the beginning really lack communication skills and are very different people. This results in screaming at each other during fights. The last year it has been significantly better, less than a handful of time, but at the beginning it was a lot. I’m worried that this has effected her, for the worst, and given her anxiety. Please don’t shame me this is something we’ve worked super hard on, and every time it has resolved immediately after and we are able to talk about it. But the last year we have been able to talk about it (whatever the issue) before it turns into yelling. 

I also worry that my parenting skills effect her, we don’t spank, I try to be at her level and explain, but when something has gone to far I tell her to go to her room and have a time out or a break. She comes back when she is ready I never make her stay there. I also worry about a time where she would not sleep, no matter what we would do she would be up all night and would flail and scream and cry when we put her in her bed for hours and hours. So I would bear hug her until she calmed down, because she would sometimes hurt her self throwing her head back against the wall or jumping off her bed on accident. 

I never questioned my parenting being too much before this pretending has happened but now I worry that I have messed her up and given her anxiety or some disorder😭 I can’t help but feel like I am doing things wrong.

So with the pretending, it started around spring time, she was pretending to be a dog, and his name is buster puppy. To get her to do anything while she was pretending we have to address her as such. This wasn’t super offer maybe once a day being short lived. Fast forward to now it is almost always all day long, she has a range of different characters most recently being “fancy” I am pregnant and was really struggling with sickness in the beginning and going to the doctors a lot. This resulted in a huge change or pace in our house, so I think this could also have an affect on her as well. 

But she get extremely upset if we do not call her who she is “pretending” to be, sometimes she doesn’t even know. She will not settles down until we say okay, or okay fancy or whoever she is. She is never herself, and I think the only time she is “herself” is when I adress her as ruby and she maybe forgets or is to distracted to realize I called her by her name and not who she wants to be. I was pretty worried about this last week, I relaxed and came to the conclusion that she is just very bright for her age, and will grow out of it. But last night we were all laying in bed together, she couldn’t sleep because we had a small road trip back home right before bed which she was asleep for in the car. She was looking at the ceiling saying that ruby is stuck there, after I was trying to explain that when mom and dad talk to you and say ruby we need to talk to Ruby. She would not accept and was puppy until she fell asleep. But before sleep she was talking. About knifes and something on the ceiling, I reminded her that knives are only for food, and she went on to pretending that she was just picking food and cutting it. 

Also around the time she started pretending she started picking her nails which has got a little better. 

She pretends in a lot of different ways too, about places and things, really about anything.

So I don’t want to overly worry about this because sometimes she just seems to be having fun I don’t want to disrupt that. But I really am starting to get worried that she is never herself, and that ruby is “over there” being invisible, and that she is someone else all the time. I’m worried she’ll start to fully believe it and develop some sort or identity disorder. Which led me to google which led me to think that I have done something wrong that has affected her 😭😭😭 

Should I bring her to a psychologist, I really feel like that is too much for a child her age but I am so worried and I don’t want to mess anything up and make her not want to be herself even more, or just to know that truly that pretending at this length is in fact normal 😣",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,78314,public,self,My almost 3yo daughter and her pretending,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/j1j8ua/my_almost_3yo_daughter_and_her_pretending/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She isn't showing any readiness for toilet training so please don't suggest this as a solution :-)

Over the last few months all diaper changes have become progressively more difficult. I've employed the strategies I picked up reading various books but nothing works. Not holding my phone, the tablet, toy, FaceTime with my mom, talking nicely, etc. She has sensitive skin so she can't sit in a soiled diaper for too long. The few times I've let her sit with a poop and told her ""let me know when you're ready to clean your bum"" she will just never be ready. I talk her through it in a nice voice, make silly voices, ask her what wrong,etc. My strategies are successful about 2 out of 10 times. 

So now whenever it's time to change her, she screams, flails around, gets so upset she's choking on her own tears. It takes two of us to change her through force. She screams to not have her pants and diaper taken off, then once they're off and she's clean she screams to stay naked and not have a clean diaper and pants put back on. She screams ""no!"" so loudly I'm afraid CPS is going to be called on us.

This also happens when it's time to change from PJs into daytime clothes or daytime clothes into PJs.

I'm at my wit's end and truly dislike being a parent when this happens and I'm struggling to work through it. I'm in my bedroom cooling off from the diaper change we just did because there was a moment when I wanted to spank her (we don't do that, and I'm ashamed to admit the thought crossed my mind) and I knew I needed to walk away.

Is this developmental? Did someone hurt her (she goes to daycare 2 days a week so now my mind is going into overdrive)? What am I doing wrong? Does this happen to everyone and I just need to trudge on?

I need to get a can as soon as possible because she has to eat every three hours and I have 41 minutes til it's time. you guys I have asked ally friends and family for help and no one can help.

Then he layed down himself and told me he needed a new diaper too. So I changed a lovely poopy diaper without fuss (that's rare!).

Later he removed his pants and diaper himself and sat on the potty. He knows what the potty is for and how it's used, but he rarely wants to go himself. He didn't want to put a diaper or trousers on after. And when we sat down for lunch he told me he needed to go potty. So he did. And then he wanted a diaper, because lunch with a naked bum was silly, I guess.

After lunch he wanted to go upstairs and went to bed without any fuss. Timing aligned, so our baby went to bed too. Without nursing, without crying. It's a win!

He slept for a good two hours and we played outside for a bit after.

At dinner he wasn't fussy and ate his meat, some potatoes and even got him to try a brussels sprout.

An SLP flagged him for potential autism due to reduced joint eye contact / responding to name.  

&amp;#x200B;

He speaks over 50+ words (colors, body parts, numbers 1-10, shapes, names of objects &amp; verbs), and has an even larger receptive vocabulary, able to follow directions well.  When we call his name, he rarely turns to look at us, however, when i ask him ""(name), am i blinking/winking"", or call him to ask him to come help with XYZ, or go put on shoes..etc"", he'd come right over, even when we called him from another room.  He doesn't seem to have any sensory/motion issues, seems pretty social, able to imitate actions, sounds, and responds to commands.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, we are currently seeking autism evaluations at the regional medical centers (in MD, Kennedy Krieger, National Children's Hospital, and Mt. Washington).

**Kennedy Kreiger and National Children's Hospital'****s** evaluations appear to be very comprehensive, as it is an evaluation by a team (SLP, Occupational Therapist, and Clinical Psychologist):  

SLP will evaluate your child’s expressive and receptive language and social interaction. The SLP will use structured and semi-structured assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations to evaluate your child's speech and language. Information gathered from the evaluation will help the SLP determine your child’s strengths and deficits, and thus develop recommendations for enhancing the child’s language and interaction.

Occupational Therapist (OT) will assess your child’s gross motor, fine motor, visual motor, visual perceptual, oral and sensory processing skills. The use of standardized and non-standardized assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations will be used to assess your child’s patterns of strength and need that impact daily performance of functional tasks. Recommendations will be provided for home, school and community implementation.

clinical psychologist: Following the evaluation with the SLP and OT, you and your child will meet with a clinical psychologist. The psychologist will conduct a clinical interview to obtain information about your child’s birth and developmental history, medical history, and social and behavioral history. The psychologist will also perform a standardized evaluation of your child's play, behavior, and social skills. Information collected during the interview, intake information gathered prior to your visit, evaluation, behavioral observations of your child, and results from the assessments with SLP will be reviewed in order to provide diagnostic impressions and information related to behavioral/psychological functioning. The clinical psychologist will provide recommendations regarding additional interventions or follow-up services that may be beneficial for your child.

  


Unfortunately, with those two hospitals, the current wait time is 6-10 months for in-person evaluations.  We had a consultation with a Pediatric Psychologist from Mt Washington last week and was told that Mt Washington offers telemed evaluation, instead of a team of specialists it will just be the Pediatric Psychologist, having us parents interact with our boy following her instructions while she observes over the laptop camera.   

&amp;#x200B;

Our question right now is should we do the telemed evaluation by a pediatric psychologist or wait for an in-person evaluation by a team?  The psychologist said SLP/OT arent really necessary for an autism diagnosis since cognitive/language issues isnt part of the autism diagnosis.  Instead, it is based on two areas - social communication and any restricted/repetitive patterns or interests.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since our 24mo is starting speech therapy soon, even without the diagnosis, we were wondering if we should wait or get an evaluation asap via telemed.  What do you all think?

We’re doing a camping trip at a developed campground close to home (about 30 minutes) next month. Our daughter (3.5) is very excited to go and we want to make sure it is a good experience for her. My husband and I both have experience camping but this will be our first time camping with our kid.

I’m a notorious over-planner while still remaining practical (I just like being prepared! Ha!). It’s probably going to be warm in the day and a little chilly at night (averages are 80s in day, 50s at night). I’m planning to bring her roll-up nap mat blanket from home (the kind with built in pillow) to stick inside her 45 degree rated sleeping bag, and plenty of blankets, layers, socks, etc to be sure none of us are cold. (I tend to get cold at night while sleeping.) We’ll all be on insulated self-inflating mattress pads.

Aside from the basics (first aid, water, folding chairs, extra snacks, tons of wipes, books, sound machine, flashlights/lanterns, etc), and fun stuff like s’mores and glow sticks, any other things I should keep in mind that I may not have thought of yet? She is mostly potty trained (still needs reminding sometimes and had her first accident in a couple months this week) and our site is right next to a bathroom (flushing toilets), so at least we won’t need to run too far!

-frequently does not respond to name when engrossed/really interested in something else 
-has recently developed a pretty keen fascination with things that spin
-has begun crossing fingers in a strange way, particularly when anxious...also, holds arms up at chest level, bent at the elbow with fingers postured while walking
-flaps arms when excited, mad, anxious (for a couple of seconds at a time, not prolonged and can be distracted out of it)
-can be very, very shy and slow to warm up in new situations/with new people
-loves playing with strings  

Things he also does that seem quite normal: points appropriately, knows a handful of words and animal sounds, self-feeds a variety of foods well, gives kisses/affection, follows simple directions, plays peek-a-boo and usually has decent eye contact (although, as mentioned above, it can often be difficult to get his attention if he’s really into whatever toy/book he’s playing with). Even though he’s shy and anxious on the playground and around new people/kids, he definitely enjoys playing/interacting with a 2 year old girl he knows very well.

My son (2) started daycare a couple of weeks ago, and currently he's only there from 9-12 because I am 95% sure he won't have good naps there. So I prefer him to come home and have his nap at home. A bunch of our friends had kids start daycare recently too, and they all say their kids either don't nap there at all some days, or only sleep for 30 minutes (where they'd usually sleep 2-3 hours at home). There's a chart on the wall detailing the times of each kids naps, and I can see that naps there are generally pretty bad. 

I've always had a lot of anxiety around my son's sleep, probably a relic from the baby stage, and I've always been really really protective about his naps. I get really worried at the idea that he might have bad naps 5 days a week, and wondering how that would translate to his naps on the weekends, and his nighttime sleep, and generally his mood and development throughout the rest of the day/week.

Ideally I'd like to extend the time he's at daycare so that I can get some things done, and have him take his nap there, but I'm terrified that if he fails to nap well at daycare it'll affect all his naps from here on, as well as his nighttime sleep and mood.

I am a father of 2 year 4 month old and a little nervous about going through an autism diagnosis here in Ontario, Canada. At 2 year old during regular visit, I went to his pediatrician when I told her he isn't still speaking alot and at the time I noticed he was pacing (walking in circles). 

During this pandemic both me and my wife are working from home and have decided to stop his daycare since he was falling sick twice with viral every month and we didnt want to take the risk of covid panic. So when both me and wife were in meeting for working, we started noticed he would get bored and start pacing.

That said, today, my son is able to speak more than 50 words (note we are bilingual) so he speaks a few words in our native and others mostly english. He doesnt yet speaks in sentences. The only sentence I remember him saying is ""daddy sit"". 

He loves sitting with a book and pointing things calling out names of things (sheep, cow, sun, apple etc). I cannot say numbers or letters yet. He points out to stuff he needs, he says ""stairs"" if he wants to go downstairs or upstairs. Loves his screen time watching rhymes but we limit that to some extent. I just hate the fact his development is most likely affected because we dont have enough time to spend with him and are scared to send him to daycare due to pandemic which I am debating now.

Yesterday, when we visited his ped for noticing white marks in his nail thinking maybe he has some deficiency (which we were told its nothing), our doctor was more focused on autism. Now what she was telling me was not staring at her when she was talking to my child combined with delayed speech are sign of autism. Of course, I am not in denial and I will go through with the diognosis but I am still questioning her method of her diagnosis. There was a nurse with whom my son was interacting, giving hi-fi when asked, he even spread his arms to take him in her arms and all while making eye contact (not litterally staring tho). 

At home, or places he is never shy. If anyone is being a little friendly and says ""outside"" he will be ready to hold you hands and walk out with you doesnt matter who you are. As a parent, I am genenuinely nervous about his development. His diagnosis is scheduled on 2nd October and I am really hoping it comes out he has nothing like that. 

I post this here to ask how were your kids at this age and what you think of this situation? Is it really that bad of 2 year old toddler not speaking and staring in your eyes if you talk to them etc.

Good morning ,

So I have an almost 2.5 year old son who throws a tantrum for nearly anything lol. Yes , I’m aware this is what most children his age do but I would love to hear your way of approaching your child when they throw a tantrum. Normally when I tell him “No” about anything , he cries and lay on the ground throwing a tantrum. It seems as if it gets worse by the day unfortunately. Usually I tell him no over and over and it gets worse and worse . So I usually go to the “old school” approach and tap/spank him on his leg or pull up. I honestly don’t spank him a lot but i really do not want to whatsoever or make that be my last last resort. So I was curious to know of ways you usually stop your toddler from throwing a tantrum. In addition, he still breastfeeds for comfort and for
Him to sleep. Is not a huge issue however that’s the “quick fix” of calming him down or him going to sleep at night or taking a nap. Not to mention, my wife and I just had a baby 5 days ago and she’s breastfeeding as well. So any advice about ways of having toddler overcoming tantrum besides spanking would be greatly appreciated.

2. She calls every kitchen a chicken and describes washing her hands in the chicken and that she’s going to cook some food with her chicken

3. She’s adamant that she doesn’t go to sleep at night, she just going to take a little nap.. and promptly falls asleep for a good 7 hours. That’s the kind of nap I yearn for😂

A little context before I bombard you with questions: My boyfriend's older brother and son (2 1/2 years old) just moved in with him. In the past month, my boyfriend has assumed the 'second parent' role that he wasn't necessarily prepared for. My boyfriend wanted to help out his brother in a time of transition and financial need. He's awesome with his nephew - gentle, kind, loves to play and teach him new things. He's spoken with his brother about boundaries, but still isn't quite sure where he lands on the 'uncle-parenting' spectrum. Currently, my boyfriend is working on potty training and expanding his nephew's very limited vocabulary (he has under 50 words and can't yet communicate when he needs to go to the bathroom which is making potty training difficult). I love them all and really just want to see their living situation be successful.

My questions are (any and all answers appreciated!):

* How can my partner set boundaries with his brother?
* How can I best support my partner?
* How did you encourage your toddler to speak?
* How do you know when to seek out a speech eval?
* Potty training - is it too soon to start?

Im sorry if this gets really long, I’m just processing it all and really beating myself up. I’m struggling with my day care provider who for the most part I like, but she’s very old school and sometimes we don’t see eye to eye on certain things. 

I should probably preface by explaining that my daughter who is 3, is suspected to be on the spectrum or have ADHD and we’ve been in the process of having her evaluated but the process is taking for freaking ever. It’s been almost two years now since we started the process, it’s ridiculous. 

So anyway, my daughter goes to day care twice a week simply for the social aspect of it and our day care lady -let’s call her Judy- has commented on how my daughter should be doing certain things for her age. She should be using a regular cup at her age. She should be putting her shoes on correctly. She’s called her “flighty” because she likes to bounce from one activity to another. Whatever. These are things that I’ve tried working with her on but she has no interest so I don’t push it. However, I’m so very proud of her because after we have struggled with potty training for over a year now (and I didn’t want to push her), she is finally potty trained aside from while she’s sleeping or in the car. She does amazing and has even started going #2 on the toilet and I am SO proud of her. 

So recently, Judy has expressed frustrations about my daughter coming in to day care with a “saturated” (her exact words) pull up. So I cut back my daughters juice intake first thing in the morning to try and help with this. However, I like to make sure she has plenty to drink first thing in the morning before she goes to day care because I know she won’t get much to drink while she’s there because of the cup situation I mentioned previously. So, obviously.. she is wet by the time we get there but I wouldn’t call it saturated. 

Now, this is super confusing to my kiddo because any other day of the week, she doesn’t wear a pull up or diaper except at bed/nap time and in the car. But Judy says I can’t send her to day care without a pull up until she’s fully potty trained. My child doesn’t understand that a pull up is not actually a diaper. As long as she’s wearing it, she will pee in it. It’s that simple. Lately, the mornings that we go to day care, my kiddo says she wants to wear “shark undies” and I try to explain that she has to wear the pull up to go to day care but that she can still go potty on the toilet while she’s there. She gets upset because she doesn’t want to wear the pull up and this morning was upset when she wet her pull up as we were heading inside day care. 

So what am I supposed to do?? Judy wants her in a pull up while she’s there, but yet if she arrives in a wet pull up, Judy is annoyed. My daughter doesn’t need to go potty on the toilet first thing in the morning because she’s already gone in her diaper all night. It’s not until after she’s had her morning juice (which I have cut back on) that she needs to go potty which just so happens to be about the time we are in the car on the way to day care or right when we get there. Judy says she has kiddo sit on the toilet for up to three minutes at a time and she usually doesn’t go potty and just gets upset. Well yeah!!  She’s in a pull up so she’s going potty in that and no longer has to go so you’re just making her sit still on the toilet for three minutes which probably just feels like a time out at that point! I don’t know what to do here. I’ll also add that the only reason Judy even tries to have kiddo go on the toilet is because I was concerned about the number of pull ups I was having to send and asked if she was using the toilet while she was there. Judy said no, kiddo had no interest but that she could give it a try after I explained that kiddo is potty trained at home. I didn’t know that meant no opportunity to try without a pull up and having to sit on the toilet for several minutes. Because at home, she just goes in the bathroom and goes when she needs to go. She doesn’t even require any help from me unless she has pooped. 

Maybe I’m in the wrong, but I know my kid. She’s hard to communicate with sometimes because she doesn’t always understand directions but I always try anyway and she eventually catches on, it just takes her a tad longer than some kids and that’s ok. We work with her. 

Anyway! I’m so sorry for the ramble and if my thoughts seem scattered. I hope it all makes sense. I’m just feeling like a crappy mom because this lady makes me feel like there are so many things I’m doing wrong and now when I thought we had made great progress with something, it feels like it’s being taken away because it’s not enough or something. She makes me feel like my kid is “that kid” that she doesn’t like having around. But it also feels like she’s limiting my child because I know her abilities and she doesn’t get to express them while she’s there. So yeah.

So this is 2nd hand story.

I was induced 9/22 so my two girls were with the grandparents. My 4yr old with my parents and 2yr old with my MIL.

The 2yr old learned how to climb out of the crib the day she turned 17mths. Living with my MIL we were not prepared to switch her to a toddler bed though we tried. So we purchased a mesh crib tent where the mattress fits inside and you zip them in to prolong their time in the crib.

Yesterday during her nap time she somehow got out and came looking for grandma. She had no idea how she escaped.

My SO was able to go home last night and return today. He wanted to see how she escaped. 

So while he was in the shower this morning the 2yr old came into the bathroom. She had still been in the crib. He changed her diaper and put her back in so he could watch how she escaped.

The little sh$t unzipped the tent from the inside and climbed out. But she didn't stop there. She climbed back up and zipped the flap up. When she got to the end she couldn't get it all the way up so she planted a foot on the mattress and put her knee on the rail of the crib to completely zip it up!

Part of me is amazed but the other part is cursing 🤬 up a storm because now we have to deal with an escape artist as well as a newborn. We have baby gates on the bedroom doors as our rooms are connected by the bathroom.

As an overly anxious parent however, I have done as much research as I can on car seat safety. I’ve watched manufacture videos of front/side/back collisions on my make and model of vehicle. I read both my owners manual and car seat manual for instillation and I always have my local health department double check the seat is installed correctly. I’m aware that none of this qualifies me as an expert, I’m still a layperson when it comes to knowledge about car safety. Always read your owners and car seat manuals to make sure the seat can be installed in the middle. This is just my personal antidote. I’m also aware that the middle seat might not always be possible, especially for those with multiple children. 

I’ve always had car seats in the middle, but since my two and a half year old moved to forward facing in my 2008 Honda CR-V, I decided to put him on the passengers side in the back because the anchor system in the middle seat requires the third anchor to be hooked on the ceiling instead of the back of the seat like most models allow for. I figured this would increase the likelihood the seat would loosen over time making me have to readjust/tighten it constantly, and that the belt would be in the way of my trunk space so I decided the side would be the best option.

Getting onto the accident: My significant other was driving and my toddler (THANK GOD) was staying at grandmas house for the weekend as we decided to take a much needed socially distanced trip just the two of us. A women in a mini van pulled out of a parking lot full force, impacting the back passenger side door (again, the door the car seat is at). The side/curtain airbags were deployed in both the front and back seat and the car spun around in the middle of the road, and it ended with us facing the direction we were coming from. 

My first thought was that my arm was broken. The side airbag hit it hard. Luckily I’m fine, we got X-rays. It’s just bruised and swollen today. My second thought was to look in the back seat. The curtain airbag did not hit the side of the car seat like I assumed it would (we all have those little head protectors that protect the sides of the head built into the seat), but instead came down from above and slightly to the side — right where my toddlers head would’ve been. The car seat would NOT of been between the airbag and his head in this case. As a nurse, nothing terrifies me more than pediatric traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure. And there’s no doubt in my mind we would’ve been life flighted to the nearest pediatric ICU for head trauma or a broken neck had he been on the car. I was so livid at this women. I was even more pissed off when she tried to blame her actions on a parked truck for blocking the view, but there’s a difference between inching out and pulling out full force. I understand things happen sometimes, but based on where she impacted us it’s clear we were right in front of her, I mean the front half of the car was passed her already. My car will likely be totaled.

Again, just my personal antidote. Ive always read middle is safest and it makes sense to me. I’ve also had my health department verify this. I’m trying not to kick myself over “what-if’s” but it’s hard not to when your child’s life could’ve been at stake. 

Some tips: 
-Car seats are deemed ineffective after being an accident. This is why it’s important not to purchase used car seats, as you never know if it’s been in one or not. I will be purchasing a new one. 

-Manufactures have videos of accident safety tests on your make/model available to the public. I believe there’s a government website I found this on (United States) but I do not remember the site name.

-Always read both the owners manual and seat manual for proper instructions for instillation. 

-See if your local health department has a car seat instillation program where someone who is trained will help you install your seat or check that it is installed correctly. 

I know we are all trying are best as parents so I hope this doesn’t worry anyone with multiple car seats or who can put on in the middle. If anyone has anything else to add about car safety, please feel free to do so! I’m always open to learning more.

She's 3 in January (2.5, 33 months, almost 3, etc) she is my 3rd and has been the WORST to potty train, but we are getting there. 

So she is doing this thing. Using her bed as her toilet. So, here is our saga... 

Our daughter does not nap, but likes to do all her sleeping at night. And she wakes up late morning, and then is sneaky quiet as she plays in her room. If I get her up RIGHT when she wants to get up she is a tantruming mess ALL DAY. Please know, I am not joking. She will literally have a non stop meltdown from the time she gets up, till she goes down, with breaks to eat, and breathe. So, I watch her the best I can pandemic schooling the 2 older brothers. 

And usually 30 or so min after she wakes, I can go get her. But she ALWAYS urinates on her bed/bedding by the time I get her. 30 min is how far I had widdled the time to. Her pedi is ok with her sleeping in since she doesn't nap (go me!) 

Hopefully you follow me. 

So, we began dressing her in clothes she can't get out of. She can undress herself. Backwards jammies be damned. She must have a gnome friend living in her doll house or something... idk man. She gets out of there. She escapes everything. 

We have placed an extra potty in there WITH this neat little potty bag that has an absorbent pad inside it. (I frankly don't trust her not to spill it, little potty has a locking top she hasn't figured out yet... but there is still time..... )

She goes potty in said potty, she uses it.. and THEN pees on her bedding. 

We have cut out sippys of water at night (all my kids have slept with water) and cut back the last sippy of water she gets (no juice or milk for her) so. By 10:30 am (when I get her) she gas not had any liquids since 6pm (the end of dinner) save the delicacy of soapy bath water- hork. She probably drinks a good half gallon of water a day from when she gets up, to dinner. 

We have changed diaper brands. 

We have thought about duct taping the diaper to her, but she has no hips so I don't think it would work (and that whole not acceptable thing) 

She is my 3rd so OBVIOUSLY she wants me to feel as clueless as a parent as possible for the last Harrah. So can anyone provide me with solidarity as I try and keep up with her laundry, advice from your own delicate defeating demon, or even someone explain to me WHY my only daughter has been the absolute WORST to potty train OR is this connected? 

(Oh, and because its relevant we began potty training her later than her brothers... but she began withholding when wearing diapers and causing herself other issues due to the discomfort of using her diaper. We STILL have withholding problems, however its more of an issue for us to get her to relax long enough- not she is too young to train) 

TLDR: my spawn absolutely fills her size 6 diaper to the BRIM with pee, pees in a potty with an absorbent pad, AND THEN pees on her bedding (usually she has drug it onto the floor- or straight up on her sheets)

basically what the title says, he is severely sensitive to change, to the point of triggering meltdowns where he’s screaming and crying until the change is reverted. 

for example, when he was at the age of using a pacifer, whenever it would be replaced with a new one(because the old one was too small or broken), he would have a meltdown and stay awake all night until he had the old pacifier back. 

another example is that when he would have new shoes or socks, he would refuse to wear them and insist on wearing the old shoes, no matter how small they were. 

today, his father bought new diapers for him (a different brand than normal), and he refused to wear them. he held his bladder for hours, and began crying because it was becoming painful to hold it in. eventually he was forced into the diaper, and he immediately peed and had another meltdown. 

i’i can’t take him to a neurologist or a doctor, we don’t have any money and his parents are a neglectful (they hit him when he cries, they don’t take care of him and leave him to the oldest brother to. they don’t play with him and let him play on a mobile phone to keep him busy. he rarely gets to go out, only when the brother takes him out does he get to) 

if this is important, he also doesn’t know how to speak yet (he can speak as well as a one year old). his brother says that he has always been anxious of everything (people, games, anything non-familiar). he hurts himself badly when he’s angry as well.

My son is super into cars and hot wheels lately... possibly too much, to the point where he can roll them around doing different things for an hour.

He brings over books to read and finds 1-2-3 countdown games hilarious. He is pretty independent at the pool and beach. He likes kicking around in a puddle jumper and can just about climb in and out of the pool himself. 

He is speech delayed though so its hard for me to gauge where he's at cognitively because he's very easygoing. He will crawl in a chair if he's hungry and follow me upstairs for bedtime or to change his diaper but his verbal communication is ""just for fun"" so far.

Every day I struggle with guilt/pride over it.

To give you an idea of the schedule:

- wake-up and breakfast are with me (mom), and then we usually head outside for a park visit or bike ride. If it's bad weather, we go to his room and do stickers/puzzles/train sets/whatever he's into.
- lunch around 12:30pm, and after that he does quiet time in his room on his own until about 3pm. He used to nap between 1-3pm, but he stopped sleeping - out of necessity/wanting that break (I do freelance part time work and try to cram a lot of it in that time frame).
- after quiet time, he hangs out with me doing books, maybe another outdoor jaunt, or some potty training/puzzles/stickers until dinner (~6pm)
- after dinner we usually get him to tidy his room, and then he can watch some TV or play on his tablet for ~45mins, then it's bath and bed by 8:30.

I guess I'm wondering how this compares to other only children who aren't in daycare. I'm proud that he seems happy and content while playing on his own, but I'm also feeling like his dad and I are being shitty parents and just tapping out early because we can.

Terrible? Good development? Should I chill out on the guilt feelings? I find myself needing a lot of recharge, and so does my husband (although I think I'm better at powering through).

If it weren't for Covid I'd have him in more activities, but it's just not a safe option for us right now.

First through third time she gets out of bed, put her back in bed and say sleepy time phrase, leave immediately.   

Fourth time and beyond, put her in bed without speaking.

If she gets up before 5am, put her back in bed and repeat above steps until her “okay to wake” clock turns green.

If she does sleep in bed quietly until okay to wake clock turns green, give her a “special treat” (cookies, fruit tape, etc).


Okay so basically... none of this has worked. She doesn’t care about the treats. She wants us to rub her back or rock her to sleep every night or else all hell breaks loose and bedtime takes an hour or longer.

I'm looking for some advice from like minded parents. 
I HATE the cry it out method. Im really sensitive to my crying babies and find it super stressful. 
Keeping that in mind, I have a 3.5 year old that mostly co slept with me until she was 2 (fed to sleep until 10 months). She is now happily sleeping all night in her own big bed. 
I now have a nearly 1 year old boy who I have to stop co sleeping with (due to medical limitations i can't currently pick him up at all which is really hard) and my husband has had to take over his sleep routine. 
Oh... my.. God.... his methods are so harsh! The goal is to get our son to sleep in his cot for the night, without a feed. But my husband is all for the cry it out method and its breaking my heart.
So here is where I need help. Has anyone got some tips for how my hubby can do this in a softer manner? And that I can take over eventually.

On nap days, regardless of how early in the day it ended or how short it was, she sleeps late AF. Like 11pm late. When we skip her nap she goes down at a reasonable time (8ish). Sometimes she naps for 2.5 hours so I'm hesitant to drop it but damn I am so over these late nights.

  
Also, how the hell do I wean her? She only nurses at wake-up (to go back to sleep) and for nap and bedtime. I honestly don't know how to get her to sleep any other way. Her dad is only here on weekends and when he tries to put her down she flips out and he gives in by letting her watch a video on his phone (he says it's the only way she calms down). 

I feel like it's harder since we co-sleep. (Is it?) I've tried getting her a new fancy cup and talked to her about it but we've had no luck.

We moved to temporary accommodation a month ago while we buy our next house. I decided to sit in the room with him while he went to sleep otherwise he would have been scared to be alone in the new room. Well a month later I’m still sitting here, except he will no longer go to sleep. If I ever try to leave he will become absolutely hysterical and I’m not prepared to leave him like that for long. 

I’ve tried putting him on 1 nap, which he goes to sleep for because he’s so tired but he’s waking up very upset after 40 mins and not going back to sleep. He will flat out not have a second nap even though he is so tired. 

Since we got back from holiday a week ago he won’t do bedtime either, just screams staring at me so I eventually give him another bottle of milk to reset him. After sometimes 3 or 4 goes on the bottle he’s eventually tired himself out enough to go to sleep. Maybe he’s overtired cause usually he’s been awake 6+ hours at this point because of missed naps. 

Up until this point I’ve been all about counting wake times, but I haven’t got a clue what they should be anymore as he’s not seeming to follow any of them. It also doesn’t help that I have no idea what time he wakes up in the morning as he lies there quietly for over an hour if left.

More recently though, a few times a week. She will wake up screaming between 1 and 2 and wont settle again till sometimes 5am and then sleeps in till sometimes 9am. As you can imagine this makes the next day really hard all round.

I dont think its an amount of sleep problem. But she is beside herself if she is in the cot. Fine if we pick her up to cuddle. But if we either sit in her room cuddling to settle if she goes ba k to sleep she is screaming again as soon as we put her back in the cot. Bringing her into bed with us occaisionally works for a bit more sleep for us all but not a habit we want to get into so we avoid that as much as possible.

I get it, I mean, when it gets dark, if you don’t know what you’re looking at through the window, it can be scary. 

So we tried explaining to him that it’s his reflection, turning the lights on and off, showing him his reflection in a mirror (which he seemed ok with all this time, until last night suddenly he freaked out in front of a mirror for the first time.) But it’s been a few days now, and it only feels like the panic is getting worse. 

So I’m wondering is this a typical thing for kids this age? I feel really bad seeing him so scared and naturally want to help him. But I don’t know if this is something we should just wait for him to outgrow, or if it could be a sign of something more serious? He’s otherwise not a nervous kid, so this strikes me as odd for him.

I yelled his name right in his face, and he immediately crumpled and started crying. He came right to me for a hug and I said I was so sorry, that is not okay for me to yell, and I hugged him tight. But the guilt is killing me and I feel like a monster.

Backstory leading up to it: 

He was following me around the house, screaming at the top of his lungs. He tends to do this for the first couple nights right before bedtime, after his dad leaves (my husband works out of town for a week at a time). I know my little one is having big feelings about dad being gone again, but good grief child, please stop screaming as loud as you can and following me around the house while you do it!! 

I try saying things like “Please stop screaming, that hurts my ears” several times with no luck. Then I get down on his level, and say things like “I need you to stop screaming now, I’m starting to feel upset” and ultimately getting to “I need to leave you here right now because I feel very upset by this screaming” and I leave the room to take some deep breaths. But that little bugger opens the door and FOLLOWS me, screaming his head off. When I look at his face, it’s like he knows exactly what he’s doing. He stops to listen when I say those things and then just start screaming again!

And so the third time he followed me into another room, I snapped and knelt down and yelled “Henry Oliver!!” right at him. 

I was screamed at by my father a lot growing up and I know that getting screamed at is a big trigger for me. I immediately start getting panicky when anyone yells at me (thankfully that hasn’t been very often until this toddler behaviour has cropped up). I’m very dedicated to breaking the cycle of trauma in my family and NOT yelling at my kids, so I feel extra bad about this incident. I’m working with my therapist on this, but holy smokes, I just want to know I’m not the only one who has snapped like this?

At first we thought it was cute and funny, but now my husband is starting to feel rejected and getting a little emotional about it.

For a little while we noticed it pick up when he was working weekends and/or late evenings (he’s usually off around 7:30). So I started ending my work day early on his days off so we could do fun family activities. Our lil dude would get so excited and his mood improved quickly. But he still pushed his papa away in the morning and evenings. 

I’ve tried giving my husband hugs and kisses in front of him in the morning. I’ve tried making it a game to “go get papa”. The only thing we haven’t tried lately is having him get him in the morning - mostly because I wake up early and sometimes he doesn’t hear us get up until our monster makes a bunch of noise - playing his recorder or crashing his cars or whatever a 2yo boy can find to be loud lol.

My son is 2, we've got ourselves bikes and a WeeRide front seat and forgot to factor in that our son is apparently scared of bikes and he has always hated having his hair messed with, drying his hair has been a cause of Great Upset ever since we started giving him baths.

I live in a suburb in a fairly rural UK town and don't drive, so getting a bike is the only way I can take him outside of our very boring suburban bubble and start trying to get back to some kind of normal since lockdown. Pre-lockdown, we lived in the middle of a small town, so I'd go to the library and just enjoy hanging out with my son in a cafe 2-3 times a week, would like to at least go back to those two activities if I can actually get him in a helmet and on a bike.

We've tried explaining, we even got him a balance bike, but because we tried to get him to wear a helmet on the balance bike, he won't touch it. The hair thing, we've tried everything we can think of and the things that have worked have worked for one evening (getting him to dry his hair, singing silly songs, making silly noises every time the towel touches him, hairdryer), then it's not worked the next. He just hates his hair being messed with.

He also won't sit in the seat, not if it's off the bike or on the bike. I got him on my lap on the bike, but that's it. Trying to do that every day to get him used to the idea, but he completely refuses to go in the seat.

Love this community haven't posted much but I search everything!

Girl is 3 next week. Daycare since age 1. She's super sweet at home. Any behaviour issues have been manageable by mommy &amp; daddy.

I'm having trouble lately when I find out she is hitting her friend at school. Daughter admits to us and says on her own accord she was hitting her friend, we'll call him Samuel. She says Samuel cried and cried because she hit him. Lots. I asked if teacher had a talk with her after and she says yea.

I feel like I do know when my daughter is fibbing or telling the truth. She says no pretty firm when I ask about something and it's a no. I know how to ask to get some responses and piece together the rest, you all know.

Anyway, I asked one teacher, Sandi, about it, her favorite teacher, she said Samuel went to teacher Sandi crying after he got hit. Sandi said there was no issues yesterday no hitting or crying.

So I don't know who to believe. I usually communicate issues directly to the director of the center. The week before my daughter didn't want to go to school one day. When I queried her she said teacher was calling her naughty and she was really sad saying ""I didn't hit Samuel!"" We stayed home and I told the director she had a bad day. He just had to call and know why I told him ""someone"" called her naughty, maybe another kid? He looked into it and she was jumping on the couch and got talked to.

Anyway, TL:DR-  Mostly what can I do at home to stop her jumping on the furniture and hitting kids at school?

She clams up and doesn't want to reveal much about these incidents. I try to put it delicately without prying or judging of course.

And a few days a week he’s the only kid in their extended care program meaning everyone else leaves at 12:15. He’s very good so apparently he just lays on his mat for an hour quietly.

I’ve done this countless times with her car seats, as well as strollers and other bulky baby gear.

Every time it happens I sneak in there and gently pat his back (not pick up) a few times and reassure him he’s ok- then he falls back asleep either for the night, or he’ll do it another 1-2 times. These “awakening” happen anywhere between 12am-4am.

Tonight’s example: asleep by 820pm, whimpered at 230am but he only did it once and he was asleep when I checked the cam, whimpered again at 310am but this time I had to go in and pat his back and reassure him- he rolled around a few times and went back to sleep.

For fun (and without thinking), I told her to say the magic words (Bibbity Bobbity bo) and close your eyes. Then, i brought out the dress and said it was “magic”. 

O boy. Big mistake. She loved the dress! But then she proceeded to say the magic words for more things (a carriage, for example) and was genuinely heart broken when the wand didn’t work. Saying, “Oh no! It’s not working! Mommy can you fix it?”

We are using the oh crap method and are now just over a week in. 


She is at the stage now where she will go pee on the potty when prompted, but not unprompted. She has gone poo in the potty a few times when prompted, but mainly accidents still for poop. We can leave the house in pants/commando and she generally holds it fine. 


My concern is, we are still having at least 1 accident per day. And sometimes the accidents are beyond frustrating and seem completely unnecessary. For example, 2 days ago she used the potty to go pee just fine in the morning, and then 10 mins later peed in her pants out of nowhere. And for some reason after she woke up from her nap today, she is on a full-on potty strike. Will sit on the potty but REFUSES to go, and had one giant accident because of it. 


Is this normal for 9 days in? Many people I ask will immediately jump to “are you sure she’s ready?” And that isnt a helpful question because yes I’m pretty sure she’s ready. I put in all this work, I don’t want to throw in the towel already. But I just wonder if I’m doing something wrong so any tweaks or helpful hints would be appreciated.

I feel like I'm ultimately just at an awkward age right now... My daughter ""X"" is 2 3/4 (3 in November) and my son ""Y"" is 1 1/2. They're exactly 15 months and 1 day apart...

My son is at that horrible age where they don't know how to play, and they only grab/take everything from another kid. In general I'd consider my son mischievous and annoying. (Sorry.) Let me start by saying my daughter (my first) was a HORRIBLE baby. Screamed ALL the time, and couldn't sleep without being held. But turned out to be an outstanding toddler. She would always listen to me if I told her not to touch something, she would always follow me in public, I never had to worry about ""corralling"" her or watching where she was. She would always stay by me in public, do whatever was said and still does. 

My son is the opposite. He was a super easy baby, barely cried and would sleep when you put him in the crib within minutes. But he seems to be a troublesome toddler. I have to watch him in public or he'll run away, hates holding hands, if I tell him to stop touching something and even move his hand away from it, he'll put his hand right back and stare at me while doing it.

I have no idea what to do... I just moved to a new city and now I have both kids more often instead of just one or the other. IT'S HORRIBLE. 

Anytime my daughter tries to play with a toy my son is crowding her and grabbing her toys ASAP. I can understand her frustration. At the beginning she was a lot more patient with him, but I've been here a month now and now even if my son ""Y"" is in her presence she is yelling ""GO AWAY!!"" Pushing him, kicking him, telling him to ""go see Daddy"" and throwing him to the floor. Even when he's not doing anything, and just in her general presence. 

I've tried telling my daughter a million times, ""be nice"" ""don't push/kick your brother"" ""stop"" ""it's not nice"" but that seems to be the only subject she won't listen to me in. I don't entirely blame her because I can see how her brother is annoying as shit towards her. (He annoys the crap out of me too.) 

I don't have anybody to learn from... My parents were extremely abusive, and my ex/father of kids has no parents either, and only learns new things when I do myself. So I feel like I'm alone on the learning subject. 

I tried googling how to help but it only mentions ""rewarding good behaviour from the eldest."" But my daughter doesn't really ever show nice playing with him. Ever. It's hard to find the time to teach them to play together because I'm cooking them their meals, keeping the place clean, and taking them out to parks during the day. I don't usually get home to sit down with them unless I'm alone with one of them, one-on-one.

I say lots of positive things with my daughter, ""good job going pee!"" ""Nice waiting at the slide!"" ""Great colouring!"" Everything! She gets lots of praise and attention. They both gets lots of attention...

I really hate being a mom right now and I'm so tired of my son constantly hiding behind me from his sister, and my daughter constantly crying and whining because she can't do anything without him pestering her... (I've tried separating them too, but it just makes my son cry) I wish my kids were older and more in the ""logic"" stage instead of the impulsive toddler stage.

It seemed she was motivated by being around other toddlers using the potty.

For the past 5 months, she mainly been at home with us. We tried using a sticker chart, with some limited success to get her to continue using the potty. She lost interest and we didn't pressure her. She tells us when she's peeing and pooping, but usually while/after it happened. 

About 4 weeks ago, her younger sister was born. 

A few days ago, we attempted 3 day potty training. We kept her pantsless except for outside time (we have mulch and a sandbox!) and it was miserable. She screamed and resisted at nearly every single potty suggestion. She was only willing to sit on the potty while holding an iPad, and we didn't find this sustainable. She pooped and peed on the floor more than in the potty and begged for a diaper repeatedly. She had tantrums all day long that turned quite aggressive. She (unintentionally) kicked me in my csection incision which is still healing. 

On the morning of day 3, we called it quits. She went back into pull-ups. Her attitude completely changed for the better. 

Since then, she's been changing her own pull-ups. Its cool when its just pee. But, she seems to poop after waking up from her nap and silently tries to change her diaper. It's resulted twice in her smearing poop around her room in her attempt to change herself.

We've removed the diapers and wipes from her room. We will be more closely monitoring the end of her nap time.

And that’s all she was saying 5 months ago. I haven’t followed through with video conferences with a speech therapist. I know. I’m horrible. Part of me was hoping she would just outgrow it and start talking one day. And video calls are hard to do with a toddler. 

I’ve been doing sign language since about 8 months. Drink, thank you, please, diaper, mom, all the basic words. She won’t do any of them. She won’t mimic me at all. I spend all day narrating our lives, Pointing out colors, asking her questions, saying what it is that she wants when I figure it out. For example - when she coughs she’s thirsty.

What can I do at home now to help her? She gets frustrated so easily and I feel like it’s because she can’t express what she wants or how she’s feeling other than screaming like a banshee.

My baby girl is 2! He's super active and imaginative.

I work two jobs during the week and have a small period of time after work during the week to take the kids (really just my 2 year old as my 14 year old handles himself) off of wifey's hands. So, while I do my best during the week...the weekend is where I really try to capitalize on time and let my wife sleep all day, or eat crunch bars and watch teen romances all day like a school girl.

I have plenty of things my daughter and I do, but I want some variation. What are some active, energy expending things do you do with your kids.

Preferably...

- At no to little cost (for instance, I crawl around on all fours with her on my back like I'm a Horsey, we dance a lot, etc)

- Inside is better because of the Florida heat, but also outside would be better if it doesn't result in her needing three baths in a row or me to soak for a day in  an Epsom salt bath!

I am trying to potty train my daughter who is speech delayed. She understands everything and can say a couple words.

I read the 3 day potty training book, but bought a little potty for her and she was doing really well on the second day self prompting and only 1 accident. 3rd day I had dad watch her and she pooped on the floor and he freaked out and then she started having accidents all over the place and refusing to go on the potty. Dad thinks she is too young and will take longer to train. I’ve been reading the Oh Crap! Method today and to me it sounds like she is definitely ready, she could hold her pee, go when I asked her to and go without asking or help on the little potty a couple times. She did a little peepee dance so that was her cue. It’s been a week since we’ve put her back in diapers. My question is do you think I should wait until she is 2?

Younger son’s crying can be very intense. He started reflux meds and ice cut dairy, which seems to be trending in the right direction, but he’s a baby, so there will still times when he just scream cries. If it happens in the same room with my older son for more than a minute, it upsets my older son to the point where he is hysterically crying and one of us has to sit with him and actively work on helping him calm down. This happened twice in the car driving home from picking the older one up from daycare and again last night at dinner when I had to give the baby medicine.

Has anyone else been through this that has suggestions on anything that was helpful? After the first daycare pick up, I talked through it all with the older one to try to prep him for what might happen in the car, but it didn’t make a difference. It’s to the point where we haven’t been out of the house as a family for over two months because younger son is so hit-or-miss on whether he’ll scream in the car or not. I don’t think it’s an attention thing because there are times when the baby cries and it doesn’t bother him or times when both of us are giving attention to the baby and he doesn’t act up, it seems more like either hearing it close or seeing it (or the combination of the two) is really distressing to him.

This is going to be unnecessarily long, because I need to work out my thoughts, so buckle in or bail!

My older son will be 18 months later this month, and he's having a hard time warming up to some family members. I'm not sure if quarantine has anything to do with it, or if personalities are the culprit, maybe a mix, but his anxiety gives Me anxiety, and I just want him to be happy and comfortable.  

Specifically, he is anxious around my in-laws. My mother-in-law in particular, but also my brother-in-law. They have really strong, loud personalities and voices, but we're not a really noisy family at home. We talk, but at like a normal volume, not the volume you'd use of you were talking to someone all the way across a busy sports stadium. As a result, he is more than shy around them. He flat out does not warm up, won't let them hold him without screaming, won't make eye contact, won't let them play with him. Even over many consecutive days.

I don't make him do anything like hug them or even acknowledge their presence, because I remember how much I disliked certain family members after being forced to be affectionate with them as a child. It actually makes me kind of sad because now I've gotten close with one of those family members and I wish we'd always had a closer relationship. That being said, my mother-in-law takes it really personally. After a couple of days of being rejected she gets a bit pouty and I can tell she is really hurt. She doesn't Say anything directly and keeps trying with him, but he's just not having any of it. She is his only grandma so I really want him to have a good relationship with her, and she's such an amazing mom to my husband and his brothers. He's also her first (biological) grandchild so she was so excited for his arrival, and I can tell that her expectations are really letting her down. She was diagnosed with cancer right before we conceived, and is now doing well but I know she worried she may never meet him, and so is all the more invested in it. Man I just feel so bad for her in this regard.

However, I rely on this fantastic woman for support because I have a younger baby as well, and it's becoming difficult to accept help because it is starting to make more work for me calming him down and then still dealing with his needs, on top of dealing with the little baby. I really need the help, but the help is unwanted by my son!

In the before times, he was so chill with them, and spent overnights without us there. I know he's gone through some other developmental changes that may have increased his separation anxiety regardless of covid, but I do worry about the impact our isolation has on him.

My brother-in-law I'm not as worried about because he's just a bit of a bonehead and tries to pick the babies up as soon as he walks through the door, Android 6 I get that a big hairy stranger appearing and plucking you out of your Mama's arms is scary, so we avoid it as much as possible now, but I worry the damage has been done from before I acquired a spine. But we don't see him too often do it's not as big of a deal, but he does love my kids, and my son loves His kids, so I'd like the relationship to improve.

He is not like this with everyone though! For example, my family he's totally cool with. They are significantly quieter, and give him lots of space to come to them, so I'm sure that helps. My dad is one of his best buds, and he lights up when he visits his Grandpa. My sisters are great with him and he adores them, will let them play with him for hours and change him, and I'm really grateful for their presence in my sons' lives. He's also okay with my father-in-law, who is a pretty quiet dude, especially contrasted against his wife, which I think contributes to her totally understandable feelings.

It's hard being his person all of the time when his dad (his Real favourite person) is at work. I want to help him feel safe and comfortable with all these wonderful people who love him and treat him like gold. I want all family members to feel connected to him and not feel rejected constantly. What can I do!!??

Also should note that they are really good people. I don't think that they have ever or would ever do anything to hurt him.

My 32mo toddler can't speak. He doesn't call things by their names, he calls it by sounds what it creates, like car - is a brrr, or a dog - is wof wof. He started trying to speak in 12-14 month, and his skills in this not much better than could be. Now he can say a complicated sentence, but use for it's sounds, like: *points himself* om nom, *points at his older brother*. And it means: I want to eat what he just ate. 

His brother had the same problems. Doctors don't make any diagnosis, only described symptoms like: delayed speech development and prescribe a courses of medications. In the beginning we tried cogitum, but unsuccessfully, and only cortexin injections course forced him, but the time was wasted, and now he has troubles with studying at school. He passed any iq tests, autism tests or something and it points that he is just a regular kid.

And everything is more complicated, because I'm living in Russia, can't find any doctor here who can make diagnose and prescribe treatment. Nobody knows why is this happening. My wife and I didn't have any problems in childhood, we didn't use drugs or something. We speak with our children only russian.

Please, if you had any similar problems, tell me what diagnosis you had, what doctor should I find, may be you know a doctor in EU, who can help. Why is this happening and how can I help my children?

My son is just a few months past his 2nd birthday and is a wild little ball of energy. I love him very much but I’m looking for some insight, advice, or resources to see what may be going on...

He’s been prone to head banging and head rocking for a while now. All the research I’ve found only states “it’s pretty normal behavior, self soothing, DONT worry... blah blah” and for a while I didn’t. However he was a very late walker (pretty sure he was just very stubborn and just didn’t want to walk) and when he did start walking it only took 1-2 days before he was walking like a pro. And he hasn’t hit any speech milestones. He babbles constantly but doesn’t seem to actually try to communicate with words. I’ve gotten so used to interpreting what specific whines or physical behaviors may indicate but I haven’t found any way to get him to attempt speech. He just flat out has no interest in mirroring or mimicking anyone when you sound out words. So there are two definite milestones that were delayed/not really hit yet....

He’s always been very much following his own path and timeline and I encourage his curiosity and him just being a kid it’s just this one behavioral thing is really starting to worry me. 

Since he’s kind of delayed with hitting some milestones and is very keen to head bang I’m wondering if these could be red flags for autism or possibly something else? I’m not trying to say “my child is defective!” I’m just wondering if anyone has advice on specific things I should keep an eye out for or maybe some other coinciding specific behaviors that I should make note of or be on the lookout for?

When he’s in his car seat he will rock his head constantly the entire ride (we were driving for 1.5 hours today and he did it the whole time). And now at night when I go to lay him down he panics; full screaming and lifting his head to let it plop back down on the bed. Sometimes during the day he’ll scoot or walk over to a wall and start softly tapping his head against it but I’m fairly sure that’s a stimulation thing as it seems he’ll only do that when he’s feeling bored or under stimulated from being stuck inside for so long. 

I fully plan on scheduling a check up with his doctor and evaluating everything but I’m curious if there’s anything else I could/should be trying or looking out for. My thoughts are it could be an ear infection, just plain obstinate two-year-old behavior that may pass or require me to help redirect or alleviate the behavior, possible indicator of autism, or maybe some underlying condition I may not be aware of.

He is making wonderful progress and things have been going more or less as planned. I was surprised to see that the majority of the time he would wake up from naps or nights dry. However, the last two nights he has gotten up a few hours after bedtime and I caught him walking straight into the bathroom. (We leave his door slightly cracked and our door open at night so he can come wake me up in the morning. We have a 2 camera monitor but he doesn't make noise when he wakes anymore.) I followed him in and he was trying to get on the potty. He is not able to fully get himself on and off the big potty by himself. (We have a small potty but he always overshoots and makes a mess which really upsets him. The toilet insert works much better with assistance.) I helped him get on and he peed immediately - I was shocked to find him waking to use the potty! I had no intentions on night training yet so I was not prepared for this to happen yet.

That being said, I am not really sure where to go from here. If he is getting out of bed to potty at night I want to give him every opportunity to do so... I am just not sure how to allow it if I am asleep and he doesn't come get me or make any noise when he climbs out of bed. I would hate for him to find his way into the bathroom and hurt himself trying to do it alone or feel bad about any accidents he couldn't avoid. I am already planning on maybe trying to leave the bathroom door closed, cutting out all liquids before bedtime and maybe putting a bell or something on his door to alert me when he opens it. He has been doing so well and accident free so I want to keep this train moving forward. Has anyone had a similar issue when you started potty or night training? How did you handle it?

General advice from google was if she wasn’t crying, leave her stood up and she would eventually settle herself. However we have tried this and she literally will continue for 5 hours (it’s now 1am and still going) and will be so exhausted that she will fall asleep for short periods resting on her cot bars before waking up and looking out for us again. 

The alternative that we’ve tried is to keep going in and lie her back down, saying ‘night night, it’s time to go to sleep now’. This results in her becoming hysterically upset and inconsolable, often to the point of being sick.

If you can help get the word out, help financially, or even just offer kind words of support, please help in whatever way you can!

In late July 2020, Cassie Marfell gathered her 4 young children, her courage, and whatever very limited resources her extended family could provide and fled from her abusive husband. She was covered in black and blue bruises, and her oldest child at 7 years of age, was already traumatized by multiple incidents of being strangled and beaten by his father. The abuse had endured since Cassie first met Brad when she was 14 years old, and he was a divorced 23 year old father of 2. By the time she was barely 15, she was carrying his child, by 17 she was married to him, and for the next 5 years she endured regular physical and emotional abuse through 3 more back to back pregnancies. She tried to leave once before, but he chased her from Missouri to Texas, kidnapped the children, abused her further, and made her come home. To ensure she could not try to run again, he kept her social security card and driver’s license in his own wallet. But after 6 months of worsening abuse, along with more planning and documentation of the abuse, she made a run for it again. This time Brad was not able to track her as quickly or easily, and the police were already aware that she had left and why. Brad threatened her family members, flirted with her friends, and somehow managed to get her new phone number. He attempted to install a tracking app on her phone. Fortunately, Cassie was notified of her newly installed app and was able to turn that phone off and replace it. At that point Brad gave up trying to force her to come home, moved his new girlfriend and her kids into the house, and started trying to exact revenge and control through the court systems.  Unfortunately for Cassie, Brad had access to better financial and legal resources, and despite having a protective order already in place, Judge Bruce Beal from the 9th Circuit Court in Illinois ordered her to appear in his courtroom with the children on Sept 2, 2020 so that he could return her children to their abuser. Cassie still did not have her license or social security card replaced due to COVID-19 limitations, so she was unable to get a job or drive. Without a job, a driver’s license, money, or additional resources from family, who had already given what they could, Cassie had no way to get back to Illinois for court. She did not qualify for legal aide in either state. Illinois would not help because she no longer resided in the state. She could not get help where she was because Illinois had jurisdiction. She did find a lawyer in Illinois willing to reduce his fees and take payments, so the best she could do was send him in her stead and pray for the best. Judge Bruce Beal would have none of it. He refused to hear the reasons for her absence, and he refused to look at the mountain of evidence against Brad proving he was a violent and dangerous man. He did not require Brad or his lawyer to provide proof of their allegations against Cassie as they perjured themselves in his court room with lies that would have been easily proven false had he taken the time to look at the evidence. Judge Beal ordered the children to be handed back to their abuser and for their amazing young mom to have zero contact with them until the next hearing on Sept 29. When Cassie, trembling with fear for the safety of her babies, arrived the following day at her local courthouse as ordered, her mother in law attempted to snatch the children from her in the parking lot, Brad nowhere to be seen. Cassie wisely refused, citing court orders that her children be handed over to their father inside the courthouse, not to their grandmother in the parking lot. Brad reluctantly went inside to retrieve what he almost certainly saw as his rightful possessions. 7yr old Jadeon tearfully begged any officer who would listen not to make him leave with his father, but they were helpless to defy Judge Beal’s order. Brad barely acknowledged his children. He quickly patted the boys on the back as they were handed over and immediately gave the baby girl to his mom. There were no hugs. No “I missed you!” No “I’m so relieved that you’re ok!” No indication of the supposed fear for their safety he had repeated in court. No affection of any kind. He took what he believed was his and promptly left. 

Cassie is heartbroken and terrified but determined to see her children safely returned to her care where they belong. Right now she needs funds to return to Illinois and to pay her lawyer. She needs support from the public so that Johnathan Bradley Marfell is not able to harm her children while they remain in his custody. She needs a public outcry against Judge Bruce Beal of the Illinois 9th Circuit Court and any others like him who rule based on their emotions rather than by facts and evidence presented fairly by both sides. She need to know that no other abused women and children will be further victimized by the court system. 

To date, here are the charges against Brad for which there is clear cut evidence, which Judge Beal would not even consider:
1. Physical assault against Cassie and her oldest child.
2. Sexual assault against Cassie.
3. Statutory rape against Cassie.
4. Threats of bodily harm against Cassie and the children.
5. Multiple outstanding arrest warrants
6. $30,000+ in unpaid child support from his first marriage 
7. Lost custody of his oldest son from his first marriage.
8.

Then she will go eventually after we say we will reward her with xyz or do xyz.... And lo and behold she had to pee. It's getting annoying honestly.

Sometimes she will tell us she has to go potty on her own. We just like to ask once every thirty minutes or so to make sure she isn't too involved in play or TV to go.

Hi everyone!

My name is Belén and I’m with the University of California, San Francisco. We are currently doing interviews with parents of infants under 1.5 years of age to learn about how stressful/scary events impact families with babies. This interview is done by Zoom and we give out a $40 Amazon gift card after. Our mission is to improve services for parents with infants in communities that have been impacted by stress the most. 

At the moment, we are only doing this study with parents who:

1. have a baby currently 18 months or younger who has experienced something stressful/scary, 
2. live in the United States, and 
3. are at least 17 years of age. 

If you are interested, please fill out our quick eligibility survey here: [https://redcap.ucsf.edu/surveys/index.php?s=3CPA94LNN9](https://redcap.ucsf.edu/surveys/index.php?s=3CPA94LNN9) (select English AND refresh the page). If you are eligible, we will contact you to schedule an interview.

If you'd like to learn more about us, here is our official website: [https://childtrauma.ucsf.edu/about-us](https://childtrauma.ucsf.edu/about-us) 

Please feel free to ask any questions. Thanks everyone!

He has to be in his bed, and he has to lay still, close his eyes, get comfy, and try to sleep. Otherwise, he will be awake until he chooses to sleep. He  can't fall asleep in a car seat, stroller, anything. Bed or bust. And he just does not acknowledge when he's sleepy.

We have spent the last year going through these cycles of laying next to him while he falls asleep and slowly making it less common. Now, with the ability to get out of bed and turn on his bedroom light, we have to do it every night. We used to get really frustrated; bedtime cost one of us our entire night. There were more times than I like to admit that he fought the good fight until 10pm or so (kiddo is in bed between 8-8:30 most nights).

When we first started introducing him to the potty, he literally peed all the time. It was very hands on that first week we ditched diapers. \n\nMy daughter (21 months) has shown all the signs of being ready for a little while now, and copies everything her brother does. We decided to ditch the diapers this weekend since she hates putting them on anyway and we feel like she's ready. Apart from one poop accident on the first day, which she actually told us about (we couldn't get her to the potty in time), she's peed and pooped in her potty every time. The challenge is...she pees every couple of hours. she doesn't seem uncomfortable, and I don't really think she's trying to hold it on purpose. we take her to the potty consistently every 15 minutes, but she sits on it says there's no pee and gets up and runs about. And when she does, she'll say pee and we grab the potty and she goes in there with no issues.\n\nI mentioned this to a couple of friends who warned me that she might be holding it in and to beware of a UTI.

He&amp;#39;s three and a half now and might have the occasional pee accident here and there, but he&amp;#39;s always been pretty solid about understanding that pee and poop goes in the potty. When we first started introducing him to the potty, he literally peed all the time. It was very hands on that first week we ditched diapers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter (21 months) has shown all the signs of being ready for a little while now, and copies everything her brother does. We decided to ditch the diapers this weekend since she hates putting them on anyway and we feel like she&amp;#39;s ready. Apart from one poop accident on the first day, which she actually told us about (we couldn&amp;#39;t get her to the potty in time), she&amp;#39;s peed and pooped in her potty every time. The challenge is...she pees every couple of hours. she doesn&amp;#39;t seem uncomfortable, and I don&amp;#39;t really think she&amp;#39;s trying to hold it on purpose. we take her to the potty consistently every 15 minutes, but she sits on it says there&amp;#39;s no pee and gets up and runs about. And when she does, she&amp;#39;ll say pee and we grab the potty and she goes in there with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this to a couple of friends who warned me that she might be holding it in and to beware of a UTI.

I am currently doing a series of research projects aimed at developing future support for parents and carers of children (aged 0-18) with a condition that can affect their appearance.

I am looking for parents or any adult with caring responsibilities to take part in an online survey (approx 20 - 30 mins).

At the end of the survey there will be an opportunity to enter a prize draw to win a £50 Amazon voucher, as a thank you for your time. Findings from this survey will contribute to the development of future support for parents/carers and families.

If you would like to take part or find out more [click here](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_esvCVhjiEbHAQZv)

Alternatively to find out more about the project you can [watch this video.](https://youtu.be/anjdM6B2QwI)

I have twin sons who are going on two years old, and my husband and I decided that we’d let their hair grow (trimming as needed) until they expressed a desire to have it cut, or there was some reason (other than gender stereotypes) to cut it. 

Well, twin 1 (T1) has super slow-growing hair, so he has what looks like a more traditional boy haircut. Twin 2 (T2), on the other hand, has beautiful shoulder-length hair. We style it every day, usually with one or two small bands to keep it out of his face. We like it, he seems to like it, all is well (or so we thought!)

We see my in-laws once every couple of months because of distance and the pandemic. We try to FaceTime with the kids and send photos to keep them involved as much as we can. They are very loving and doting grandparents and we all love them very much. 

HOWEVER, today we were visiting my in-laws in person, and in the middle of a fun, light-hearted lunch, they sighed and said, “There’s something we want to talk to you guys about...” in such a doom and gloom way, I thought one of them must be very sick or something terrible had happened. Then they said, “we don’t want to overstep but...” and proceeded to tell us that they are gravely concerned about our son’s long hair because:

1. My FIL has vertigo that he believes or has been told is related to his posture/head positioning, and because of that he’s concerned that my son’s hair will mess with his development. And that they have noticed that my T2 sometimes leans his head back or to the side (doesn’t everyone?) and they think it’s his hair causing it. 

2. “It’s hard enough to be a little boy, we don’t want you to make it harder for T2”

3. Whenever we show people pictures of our grandkids, they always say “that kid needs a haircut”

4. Whenever they see a photo of him, he doesn’t seem happy

5. They don’t want to make us mad, they just love T2 to death and want him to be happy

I basically told the in-laws okay, noted, the head position thing might (MIGHT) be something to consider, but I won’t even entertain a discussion about the gender issues they are bringing up. They then denied that it has anything to do with gender.

Soooooo, I’m pretty sure it’s actually all about gender norms, and the head position thing is dumb and made up. I can find no evidence anywhere that having long hair that’s well tended poses any danger to healthy physical development. The fact that they are so focused on what random people my husband and I don’t even know think about T2’s hair makes me think it’s actually about their discomfort with having a long-haired boy in the family. 

I had an inkling that they didn’t love the long hair, but I never thought they’d go this far. My FIL even said that he’d lost sleep multiple nights worrying about my son’s hair! We tried to tell FIL and MIL that as the parents who are with him every day, we think we would know if our son were unhappy or uncomfortable. 

We left today under a cloud, and I’m just so offended and upset. I want us to say something to them to lay down some boundaries, but part of me just wants to ignore it.

My last post was 23 months.

My child’s development seems pretty typical, nothing outlying, but words have lagged a lot.

Like, none. 

Well maybe 1 word/sound now. “Moo” for cows, and the moon.

There were a handful of words before about 19 months when all this experimentation ceased.

I’ve sought referrals from our GP and advice from every available avenue for professional opinion but after making concerned noises they always give me the watch and wait line. That is to say we’ve not been offered any actual speech or developmental assessment or treatment.

Mostly I accept that. Because there is no obvious area of concern besides expressive language.

Except that there is!!! Skill loss. Word LOSS. I always end up biting my tongue on that one, as no one is hearing my concern about this. 

I was advised by an infant specialist nurse to go back to my GP in October if nothing was changing. How should I explain our situation this time?

About three hours into our trip today he became very upset in a matter of a second. He was sobbing, his face was red, his palms were sweaty, forehead was definitely warm. I pulled him out of his car seat and held him, at which time we noticed he was pulling at his diaper. It was clean and dry so I pulled it off just to have a quick look around to see if he had maybe been bitten by something or developed a rash that was bothering him. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Put a new diaper on him for good measure and held him close again. Within 2 minutes I noticed his diaper was wet. It wasn't just the indicator showing it was wet, it was soaked (like an overnight diaper).

Back when she was about one, she was riding in a shopping cart while we got groceries and this very tall, huge man who obviously had some kind of developmental issues and also happened to be black, rushed over and started yelling at us. It terrified LO and no matter what we did, it seemed like she was permanently scared of dark skinned people after that. She would scream and hide and cling when any black friends would come over, refuse to play with any kid who was darker skinned, you get the idea. 

There was even one horrible incident when she loudly announced that she wanted to leave the community swimming pool because a family of ""black mans"" arrived. 

We kept taking every opportunity to show and explain to her that skin color has nothing to do with how mean or nice someone is, that just because someone looks different doesn't mean they're bad or scary, and that people come in all colors and judging them based on that is not a nice thing to do. I even pointed out that she and I are a couple shades darker than her sister and dad, and grandpa is very tan (he's Hispanic with a lot of Amerindian ancestry) and we're all nice people. It just didn't seem to be sinking in though. We watch shows and read books with people of different races and skin tones and she seemed to be accepting (or at least not actually saying anything about it), then we'd see someone of color in real life and boom, back to clinging to me/asking to leave.

We've been home a lot since quarantine and the other day I had to take her with me to a store for the first time in awhile. I told her if she was good about wearing her mask, etc., I'd buy her a toy. She said she wanted a doll so I took her to that section and she scanned the selection before settling on a dark-skinned one. I didn't make a big deal out of it or anything, just told her I thought it was a good choice and bought it. She's been carrying it around and hugging it since, and even said that she thought it was extra pretty because of its brown skin. I realize this isn't a huge deal for most kids, and thank goodness for that, I'm proud of her for not associating that doll's skin color with anything bad. I think we might have finally made some kind of progress! 

I'm still worried it's not enough, and I think teaching acceptance is a lifelong thing, but it's encouraging that she's at least past it enough to choose and adore that doll.

Any sound advice would be so helpful.
Im in a serious long term relationship with my partner who has a two year old. We spend  most of our time together and I'm generally at his house whe he gets the little one. Our sleeping arrangements are what my question is about. little one has own room with a toddler bed ( never slept in) and a playpen bed situation in daddys room. Dad and toddler cosleep. ( I don't have a problem with the cosleeping) I'm having an issue with the fact that little one can not go to sleep on their own. So when toddler needs to go down for a nap or sleep at night daddy has to go down too. Sometimes he naps with baby but if he doesn't fall a sleep he gets up and goes about his or our day (this is for nap time) I've even put little one to sleep before she is not able to sleep independently, if she's slightly still awake and she feels you move your body from under her she'll grasp on to you extra tightly or wake up and cry until you comfort her back to sleep by holding her. My partner doesn't have a problem with me sleeping in the bed with the two of them. I do, I've expressed once that I don't think is good little one cannot sleep on her own.

Does anyone have suggestions on how I can ease them to get along a little better, and find projects they can do indoors and outdoors so everyone gets their needs met? 

As for the little brother, I just hope they all get along a little better as he gets older. He’s with me full time, and he absolutely adores them. He is a super sweet little boy, and cries all the time when his sisters ignore him.

Unfortunately, my toddler brother doesn't get it very much, which is fine - the games he'd want to play are Candyland and Chutes and Ladders anyway, which aren't very exciting.

That's all well and good, I'll just play games to my friends' houses and play them there. Well, the pandemic happened, and now the only place with a big enough table for any of my neighbors and I to play (for the uninitiated, board games can occupy pretty wide table space) is my house.

My house is not very big. We have one floor and the only real rooms are the bedrooms, the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room are all open space. My toddler brother can easily see if I'm playing a board game, and he hates it.

He gets so mad at us whenever we play games. It doesn't matter if I play with my neighbors or I play with my parents, he gets so jealous and starts throwing his toys at me. I cannot include him in our games because they're far too hard for him and also require strategy for any of us to win, so I can't just go, ""Why don't you roll the dice?"" or ""Why don't you grab the card?""

I haven't played a board game in months, either solo or multiplayer, because I really hate upsetting him.

When she took her first pee, it was all over the floor but I managed to move her onto the potty in time and she got some in it. We clapped and cheered and i was excited. 

But then things went downhill. She had several back to back accidents after that including a poop and each time I tried to move her on to the party I got the arching back, and a “noooo” while screaming. Finally several hours later I got one more pee in the potty in the same fashion as the first success. But if I prompt her to sit on the potty, she ignores me and/or refuses. 

Is this normal? The book doesn’t really give any suggestions besides that maybe I’m over prompting and should back off. I do that, and she instantly pees on the floor or couch when I turn my back. I am pregnant with #2 and exhausted from cleaning up pee all day. 

Should I persevere and keep going? I should also note that she is not the type to just sit still chilling on the potty until pee comes out. When she does sit on it, it lasts 5 seconds max.

I have been friends with her mom for about 3.5 years.  Ever since her friend began talking, she mispronounced her name as “Cindy.”  She is not the first child to do so, and I understand that she won’t be the last.   Her mom did not try to correct her, and I let it slide for a long time because I figured it would eventually fix itself.   But as time went on, it became clear that she was continuing to say “Cindy” out of habit, not because she couldn’t say “Sydney”.   My daughter had actually mentioned it to me that her friend says her name wrong, so I knew she was noticing it now.  So I politely told her mom a few months ago, “hey can we encourage your daughter to say Sydney and not Cindy from now on?”  And the mom told me yes that’s fine.  I thought that would be the end of it. 

The next few play dates she made no attempts at correcting it, and her name was said wrong every time.   I ended up stepping in to do it a few times, but I really felt like this was something her mom should have been doing and I felt uncomfortable doing it since it’s not my child.  

After a few weeks, nothing changed, so I brought it up again.  She said that she had talked to her daughter about it “when I mentioned it last time.”  I told her that I thought correcting her as it happens would be the best way really help her to learn it.   A few minutes later her daughter says Cindy again so her mom calls over, “hey can you say Syd-Ney?” And her daughter yells NO!  My friend turns back to me and says “yeah that sounds about right, she knows it’s wrong she just doesn’t want to say it.”  And that was it!  I was fuming but held it together and sent her a follow up text that night saying how important it was to me and that I really needed her to work on this with her going forward.  Especially since it is clear her daughter can say it. 

Then one day recently we were having a play date and Sydney yelled over from where they were playing “MOM!! Mom my friend said my name right!!! She said Sydney and not Cindy!!!”  She was elated.  I laughed and said “that’s a Awesome!!!!!”  and she went back to playing.  I turned back to her mom and said “wow she was pretty amped about that!” And her mom replies “well it’s a hard name to say.”  I made a confused face and said “well...” and she cut me off and said “well every kid I’ve met has had trouble with it.”  She definitely seemed pissed and I was so caught off guard that I didn’t know what to say.

A week or so went by and I realized that I had to say something.  So I sent her a message reminding her of what had occurred and and what her response was.  I said that it really hurt my feelings and that I was very confused about why it was said when Sydney was extremely happy in that moment to hear her name said correctly.  I felt she had taken something positive and made it negative.  I reiterated to her how important it was to me that my child have her friends try to learn to pronounce her name correctly when they are able to do so. 

She sent me back an “apology” but really it felt like a “sorry not sorry”.   She said she was sorry that I was hurt by the comment but that she was “defending her child and nothing more” and that “her child takes longer to pronounce some words”.   I am incredibly confused what needed defending in this situation, and also we both know that her child can say Sydney without any issue.   I sent her a follow up message and I never heard back from her. 

In my opinion, getting someone’s name right is the most basic form of respect you can show someone.   And I have never once gotten angry at her child for mispronouncing it, I have always been fully understanding that it is a habit that has formed!  What I want to see is my friends caring about me and my child’s feelings on this issue and helping to correct the problem.

I am looking for a good early education curriculum for my 2.5 year-old son.  He was in regular daycare before the lockdown and wasn't able to go back with the new limited class sizes.

Lately I started noticing some things that are worrying me and I wonder if I need to be concerned about him possibly being on the spectrum.

He does really well emotionally and socially. He smiles and makes eye contact, he loves to be cuddled and will seek out affection and reach up to be picked up. He has a sassy little sense of humor on him and laughs appropriately for situations. He'll offer his toys and share even if just for a few moments. So far, he loves to stack rings, make his toys ""talk"" to each other, play with his linkimals, he's trying to figure out duplo blocks, pretends to read or is trying to rather. He was a little late with walking, mostly because he was anxious and still has some balance issues. He picks up things quickly, provided he has interest and also will study something to figure out how it works. 

So there's many positive things I've seen but then there's the other things. I first noticed, even from 6 months that food textures sometimes upset him. He's gotten better, but sometimes, especially with meats he still doesn't vibe. Also, if he doesn't like the food he's eating or he's upset, he will sort of clench his fist and open it rapidly. It looks like hand flapping without the bending at the wrist and just the fingers. When he gets super excited, he'll tense up like his little body is overwhelmed by big emotions. He doesn't always respond to his name, but my husband and I think that might be because he's called by his name and nicknames and might be confused? He doesn't wave at all and doesn't clap much. I've seen him pick up games and things instantly before but I cannot get him to do this. Also, I've read about at this age they should say like 20 words. He says mama, Dada, whoa, yeah, oh, bop (his word for his pacifier), and lots of babble and near words. But not 20. He understands many though. Also, he doesn't point things out. He will hand us things and point to his toys as he's playing but he's not pointing at things when we ask.

My husband is quiet, studious, reserved. I've wondered if that's just his personality traits he got from him. But still, I have pause. For those of you that have been through this before and aren't in FTM panic mode because of Dr. Google, would you see cause for concern here? Could there be something else going on? Anything you could share or insight you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I've almost cried myself to sleep most nights this week worrying I've done something wrong.

Reading to our children is important for their development, their future success, and even their critical and creative thinking. Here are some ways that we can help our little ones grow into lifelong readers.

&amp;#x200B;

***Helpful Tips on Raising a Little Bookworm***

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Become a Reader Yourself** (if you read already, consider reading more)**:**

**It's important for young children to see positive habits and behaviors modeled instead of merely encouraged.** If a child sees the importance of books in the lives of the parental figures, they are more likely to place importance on books in their own lives.

We often lounge around the living room on Sunday mornings reading with [quiet music playing in the background](https://open.spotify.com/show/6uCQuDoNQjQUtuVexT3gGc). By now, Luna has become so used to these Sunday morning routines that when she sees us reading, she takes it as a cue to bring her own book into the living room, sit on the couch with us, and dig into one of her favorites. It is nice to have quiet time where we are all together but separate, lost in our own worlds.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Make Sure Your Child Has Access to Their Books:**

When I say access to the books, **I mean physical access**, where they can REACH their own books. Children, and especially toddlers, play with what they can get their hands on. If they don't have access to their books, they most likely won't come to you and ask to read, they'll just find something else to play with.

The same is true for the reverse; **have an easily accessible ""library"" of books available within reach, and you'll find more often than not that your child will read at all hours of the day**. We can't count how many times we've walked in on Luna playing in her room with stacks of books surrounding her and her face jammed in an open book.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. ReRead, and Read Differently:**

Rereading is a great way of encouraging your child to read what they like, not only what's new or next on the list; it shows them that reading is also for enjoyment and not just for knowledge or to pass the time; it shows them that there's always something new they can learn, even if it's from the same book they've read countless times.

Rereading also **builds familiarity and allows your child to join in on the story** because they know it well enough to recall what's next (by the way, ALLOW your child the opportunity to join in and recall and predict what will happen next).

Also, **read the story differently from time to time**. By this, we mean to use different voices, ask different questions, maybe sing the book instead of reading it -- get creative, and have fun!

If you show your child that you can have fun with reading, they'll feel encouraged to have fun with it too. You'll also be giving them a **big boost in the development of their imaginations** while you're at it!

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Read While Out and About:**

Street signs, restaurant names, bus ads (when appropriate), etc. Show your child that the whole world is filled with words and that words hold very special meanings in society.

The added bonus on this one is that the world is filled with signs (another language in and of itself). Your children will begin associating signs with specific words and actions, and isn't that what helps society run a heck of a lot smoother in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Talk With Your Child Often:**

Your children are sponges; show them your vocabulary and allow them to soak it up. Human language is an extremely versatile, beautiful, and important tool, and the more you use it, the more your child will want to expand their vocabulary to share in the magic of communication.

[According to the research](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf), The **quantity of words spoken** to a child **in the first three years of life** is **strongly associated with a child’s language skills, vocabulary size and IQ later in life**.

Also, be sure to give opportunities for your child to show you THEIR vocabulary; let your child dictate the topic of the conversation (they're more likely to talk more about something that interests THEM); and let your child create their own words from time to time -- go as far as to use their words to describe the object/action in question. It builds self-esteem and opens up the imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Write at Home:**

Reading and writing go hand-in-hand. Show your children that they can **create** with letters and words.

If you hand-write grocery lists, notes, or even captions to drawings that you've created together (see #7), your child will be that much more exposed to the written word, placing higher importance on it in their minds.

This is a win-win... they learn to read THROUGH learning to write!

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Draw With Them:**

[Want to help your child write? Let them draw!](https://theconversation.com/want-to-improve-your-kids-writing-let-them-draw-25007) We sometimes forget the importance of drawing and its place as an avenue for human communication.

[Research has also shown](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09500782.2012.704047) that drawing before beginning a writing exercise improves the students' ability to organize their thoughts. The two are connected because they are both modes of communication, perhaps even activating the same parts of the brain.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Visit Your Local Library:**

Take your child to activities that involve reading just like you would with music or physical play. Showing children that reading is an activity worth traveling to emphasizes the importance of that activity (reading) and places it on the same level as baseball practice, dance class, music class, karate... you get the point!

We set aside time for all of these other activities, so let's begin setting aside specific time for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Give POSITIVE Feedback to Your Children!**

This last one may be obvious to most, but it's extremely important, so it has to be on this list!

[Those same studies from #5](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf) showed that children exposed to more positive feedback and statements in relation to negative feedback and statements **had the highest language skills at age three and beyond.**

*\*\*I want to add that positive feedback and statements in ALL areas of your child's development create massive increases across the board, so be kind to your children, encourage them, and make sure they know you're PROUD to be their parent/caregiver!*

&amp;#x200B;

***Summary***

&amp;#x200B;

Having worked as a literacy instructor, I could go on and on for days about the importance of literacy in a child's (and adult's) life. We only scratched the surface, but to add a few other points:

&amp;#x200B;

* Reading is consistently the number one ""secret"" that all successful people give.
* The amount someone reads at an early age has been shown to be a significant predictor of future success.
* And the more one reads has time and time again shown a correlation with higher IQ levels, problem-solving abilities, and even an increase in creative thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you have any more suggestions, we'd love to hear them!!**

She completely blocks me out when I try to correct her behavior. She does not acknowledge it in the slightest. It’s like she is 100% in her own world and cannot hear. The worst is when she gets into these hyper bursts and goes absolutely bonkers. 

Whispering doesn’t work, observational speak (“I see you’re angry”) rarely works, ignoring it doesn’t work, a bottom smack doesn’t work (she laughs), and being stern works on occasion.

It’s not unheard of for her to put up a little fight while we try to put her to sleep, but nothing crazy. Lately though, she’ll fight and fight, an hour sometimes hour and a half or even two hours past her bedtime. At times she’ll be *screaming* bloody murder for quite a while as if she was in pain but she’ll get distracted, stop, then go right back to it. My wife is patient, we are there for her, we try to calm her, we know she’s tired, but she fights it.

We are so confused by this behavior. What’s the right thing to do?  We’ve tried reassuring her, holding her, singing, reading, turning off all the lights in the house, everything! She’s not compliant with the nighttime ritual (brush teeth, a couple stories/songs and turn off the lights). She will drag my wife’s hand and walk around aimlessly but when my wife directs her to bed, she starts screaming and fighting.

Tonight the last time out, I put him back in the chair at least 6 times. We use the rule 1 minute per year of age - but we never really get there in one go.

1) I think what I need most is support (not necessarily in regards to parenting techniques - I am open to suggestions!). I often disagree with my spouse (a stay at home dad - who has to deal with the kiddo the most) on discipline. The gleeful runaway toddler is not helping our parenting differences.  I try to divert and use time outs (taking away an object doesn't seem to work at the moment or taking away a future activity that he likes doesn't either). My spouse thinks we need to be more aggressive.  

My Spouse will sometimes threaten a spanking (more a threat most of the time) and is especially exasperated with the little guy right now. It doesn't help that he can also be quite reactive especially if  the little tyke guy accidentally hurts him, which is easy to do (My spouse has physically been through the mill surviving cancer, has had multiple surgery sites that are tender 5 years later, and suffers greatly from peripheral neuropathy). Cancer has also left my husband exhausted and needing a nap that the little guy is refusing to do.

With covid, we go to the park on a pretty regular basis and we see a couple of friends' toddlers occasionally, but besides that she has only a fraction of the exposure to other kids that she would have outside of the pandemic. We had gym childcare and more regular playdates with friends before. Our job situation doesn't require any need for childcare.

My job is now offering a generous childcare benefit through the end of the year (might be extended beyond that), I think mainly to help out employees who are struggling with managing multiple kids and distance learning and all that. This got me thinking that maybe I should take advantage of this temporary benefit and enroll my daughter in some kind of very part-time (like 2-3 mornings a week) childcare situation so that she can spend some time with a consistent group of children, and that it will perhaps help her social development and maybe help her out with speech (she is in zoom-based speech therapy as well right now, which has been great!) but I am wondering about if there is any real actual benefit of this at her age.

I generally like the Montessori type of philosophies about not needing major structure or adult-directed ""learning"" at too young of ages, and I really like Janet Lansbury and RIE parenting that focuses on exploration, play, freedom, less intervention, etc. But I also really feel like being around a consistent group of kids might really benefit her. I'm just not sure if that's just my own feelings or if it's a reality.

Do you think there are socialization (and potential speech) benefits from childcare for kids under 2? 

I've looked into meetup groups and other little things I could do on a regular basis to get socialization benefits but I'm not seeing a whole lot of options in my area, it seems that most things are still shut down. I've thought about more regular playdates with our toddler friends but my work schedule is really inconsistent and we can't figure out consistent times that work for everyone on a weekly basis. 

Also I'm not asking about covid considerations, I want to hear opinions as if covid was not a factor.

My little one is now 2 yrs and 4 months. 

On a few occasions over the last month he has woken up a couple of hours after going to bed crying and completely inconsolable. 

He won’t let me touch him or be near him. He will physically push me, my hand or face away and cry harder. 

I talk to him soothingly and reassure him that everything is okay and I’m there. I fetch him another bottle of milk and It takes a good 10 minutes or so for him to calm down enough to lie back down. He will then let me usually stroke his back or hair until he’s properly settled. He won’t fall asleep whilst anyone is in the room (hasn’t done since he was a baby), so I generally leave the room and he goes back to sleep whilst drinking his milk. 

I’m not sure if it’s night terrors or nightmares. From what I’ve read night terrors seem to when the child is still “asleep” and therefore isn’t aware of what has happened and doesn’t wake. 

I’ve also reads that nightmares can cause children to want assurance and cuddles etc to feel safe and generally not push parents away.

This is the first time that my husband has had a long trip since my oldest was a baby and she is really missing daddy and having a hard time.  My oldest has a massive vocabulary and has been talking in full sentences since she was literally around a year and a half.  She has a pretty gnarly temper on her and can spaz out but she’s 2 so that’s par for the course I thought. Because of her temper we do a lot of work with her to help her actually name her emotions, which results in her yelling things like “I am mad at mommy. Don’t want mommy. Want mommy to run away. Want to hit mommy. Want to throw toys.  I’m angry. I’m mad. I’m disappointed etc”. Basically she will narrate her feelings. 

Because hubs is gone she has been lashing out, and having more tantrums than usual. She’s been telling our nanny she is mad at daddy, she doesn’t like daddy etc. She’s also been super clingy with me and having tantrums when I leave or have to work in my office. My nanny and I are on the same page In terms of discipline and usually we have her take deep breaths and we stay near her and tell her we can talk about it when she calms down. This is intentional because we are trying to arm her with the tools she needs to calm herself down. We don’t reinforce the tantrums because we don’t give in to her demands and we always have a conversation about her behavior. If she’s starting to yell or hit we do time outs but stay near her and tell her she has to get it all out before she can resume playing. It typically works for her. 

I knew my mom disagreed with my parenting style but today she told me she thinks I need to have her evaluated and that I need to find a therapist to help me parent because her behavior isn’t normal. She told me she doesn’t stay on task, she’s disrespectful and tantrums and my discipline isn’t working so I need new tools. She said she thinks she has ADHD. My mom thinks I should be spanking her occasionally to get her in line and that’s part of the reason she is so bad.

I just feel kind of lost and overwhelmed. My parents spanked me a lot and I never really felt safe growing up. I just thought that she was 2 and on some 2yo shit but my mom says other 2yo aren’t like her and they don’t act like that. We have a full time nanny so she’s not in daycare and so I don’t have a feel for how other kids are. I guess I’m just trying to understand what “normal” behavior is for a 2yo and if anyone has had evaluations at this age?  I firmly disagree on hitting her, I just feel like how the hell am I supposed to teach her to manage anger and strong emotions if I’m hitting her? Like I’m an adult and the best I can come up with is hitting?  I don’t really yell at her either because I don’t want her yelling at me.

My 27 month old has an appt. today with her pediatrician to get her feet checked out. For the entire summer, they have been incredibly dry and peeling. We would put aquaphor on them at night with socks, but 85% of the time she rips the socks off immediately when we leave the room when she is in her crib. Then she will wake up at about 1-2 am and pick and scratch her feet. She also picks and scratches them during the day. She will sometimes even bite the skin off that is peeling. I know it is driving her crazy. Sometimes the peeling and dry skin will bleed... I thought it was just dry skin during the summer but I scheduled an appt. to try to get some sort of prescription ointment. 

I am at my wits end with her sleeping. The feet itching wakes her up, and nothing, I mean NOTHING will sooth her except a bottle with 3 ounces of milk. She will drink he bottle and go back to sleep. Last night I try to let her CIO and she cried for 30 minutes scratching her feet until I gave her the bottle.

I'm not sure what my question is, or if this is just a rant, but I am so stressed. She does not ask for bottles during the day. I even told her we gave her bottles to other babies, and she understands it, until the middle of the night when she is throwing a fit for her bottle.

She has had eczema since she was born, but the foot issue seems totally different. The skin will peel off, and the skin on her toes will crack open and bleed, then will be healed the next day if she wears aquaphor and socks to bed. But she doesn't like sleeping in socks.

My hope is that we can get the itchy skin under control so she will stop waking at night, then she won't need her bottle.

Any tips for hope???

She has had allergies lately (we live in TN so ragweed is terrible right now).... she was been waking up rubbing her nose and eyes, sneezing, no coughing. So I have been giving her benadryl at night to help her sleep. The benadryl is not helping her feet though.

I am just really hoping her doctor has some suggestions. I am so sick of her waking up at night.

Throwaway, because I am ashamed, but I really need help. Trigger warning, lots of bad mental health stuff here.

I realized today that I have been a very neglectful mother.

For context, I am a SAHM with an undiagnosed mental issue. I deal with severe abandonment problems (bio dad left me too early for me to remember, my mom stopped being my mom because she had repressed memories come up, and my husband almost died because of an eating disorder).

I got bad enough to where I was severely suicidal.  I should have been committed to a hospital.  Husband was in the middle of his eating disorder crisis, he worked 80 hours a week, my child was a newborn, and I felt completely alone.  I thought about dying every day for almost 2 years in a row.  I would get panic attacks that lead to me screaming, and compulsively self harming (head hitting and biting to the point of bruises and bumps).  When I was calm and felt panic coming on, I would occasionally deliberately self harm by cutting, in order to not get to points of panic.  Cutting could be done in secret, the panic attacks were loud.  I broke a window, once.

I told friends I was suicidal, and I got told I wouldn’t act out on it because I had a daughter.  Talking about wanting to cut garnered a similar reaction.  There was lots of telling me to write lists of what I was grateful for, to try to be happy, or pointing out that I could be doing more.  It was terrible.  When my husband found out I had been cutting, he shouted at me.  I only had 1 friend who was a healthy emotional support, and he wasn’t available often.

I am upset that my friends didn’t commit me to a hospital.  I am upset that I didn’t commit myself.  I tried numerous medications, psychiatrists, and therapists.  I am now with a therapist who is very good, and looking for a psychiatrist more committed to finding a diagnosis (my last one focused more on medication and short-term solutions).  I am trying to get help, but I am still really struggling.  

Cutting to the chase, when my daughter was about 2.5 years old she dropped her naps.  I didn’t know what to do.  Those breaks were how I functioned.

I resorted to leaving her in her room, without her half of the doorknob off (the house we rented had weirdly loose knobs).  Theoretically, this should have been fine.  The problem was that often the “nap times” went on for 2-3 hours, whether or not she was sleeping.  I would just sit on my couch and watch TV, or be online.  There were a couple of times where she cried during most of this.  My church told me she needed to “cry it out”.  I shouldn’t have listened.  I was trying to make her sleep.  Eventually I stopped, and quit nap-times altogether.  Now, sometimes there are days where she is on the couch using her iPad to watch Octonauts or Puffin Rock for 2-3 hours.  I shouldn’t let that happen, but it’s better than her being in her room.  

It hit me today that I virtually locked my child for 2-3 hours a day, consistently.  I do not want her to feel neglected, unimportant, or traumatized.  I am scared that she might be.  She struggles deeply with bedtime.  What if this is why?

Jumping to the present, most days I cannot realistically be with her alone during the day for long periods of time, because in my panic I have screamed at her in the past.  When I am alone it is a struggle just to make myself eat.  I am still cutting.  I want to shield her from all of this, but I feel like the only way to do that is to neglect her by leaving her with other people.  They are safe (grandparents, her father), but she needs me, but I don’t feel like I am good for her.

How do I assure my daughter that I love her?  She kept asking for mommy today.  I’m just panicked most days for no reason.  I let her in my room to show me her drawings or give a quick hug, but then I had her leave to go be with daddy again (he worked from home for about half the day, and then took a break to be really available to her and is now finishing his work since she is in bed).  I tried just saying that I was feeling sick and having a bad day, and that I needed to rest.  I don’t know if that was right or wrong.

I need to know how to assure my daughter that I love her, and that she isn’t alone during this time.  She’s only 3.  I don’t want her to know what’s going on with me, but she understands that something is amiss.  Sometimes it’s screaming at her or not seeing her during the day for most of the week.  What do I do?  I am learning to take my space instead of being around to shout at her, which I am proud of, but I do not want her growing up not knowing her mom.

I should stop typing.  This is a novel.  I’m just looking for guidance.  

TL;DR

&gt; A 4-year-old toddler found herself floating nearly a mile off the coast of Greece on Monday, accompanied only by her unicorn floaty. 

 &gt; The child had been pulled out to sea by a current when her parents looked away for only a second. 

&gt; Luckily, a crew of a passing ferry approximately 1600 feet off the Gulf of Corinth spotted the child and her inflatable companion as they drifted further and further away from the shore, reported the Greek City Times. 

&gt; Captain Grigoris Karnesis pulled the child carefully aboard as onlookers watched on in awe. 

&gt; ""The little one was not cool, she was frozen from her fear, because the current was very strong,"" Karnesis told the Greek City Times.

So my cousin(F35) and I (40F) each have a 4 year old daughter.

My cousin did live far away so the girls didn't see eachother except for holidays, but recently they both moved where we live.

Sharing is obviously an issue for children and adults lol which is to be expected. 

Before each visit I explain to my daughter that we share and are kind to everyone. I try to have my daughter bring some of her dolls with her when we go over to their house in case the other doesn't want to share.  i remind my daughter that she wouldn't like it if her cousin wouldn't share. And all that jazz.

My cousin is a teacher and she is good at explaining things to her daughter as well as mine. But im starting to think that her positive approach with her child isn't working and its starting to ruin all the times we spend together.

 My daughter isn't perfect and can be a sour patch kid, but today my husband, my mother and myself witnessed a new side of my cousins daughter, and I am not sure how the future will be with them.

1. We offered to take my cousins daughter for a bit at my moms house. Take the girls swimming. They both seemed excited. My husband and I came separately (he had her). So when she was dropped off she was fine, just waiting for my daughter to get there. My mom has an oversized bedroom that allows for my daughter to leave some toys as we are there a lot, my niece asked if she could go and play, I said yes.

My daughter comes in 10 mins later and goes in all excited and says hi and my niece shot daggers at her and grunted and turned away. My daughter was heartbroken. So I go in and bring my daughter and my niece is magically happy, they start playing together. (Niece was mad that my daughter was there and she would have to share my daughters toys with my daughter, this isn't new. Also seems to be a bit fake when an adult enters).

2. Then of course issues outside playing which were more of the same.

3. We went back in after the pool and they were playing.. About a half hour later the windows were open and the wind blew the door shut. A couple mins later i hear my daughter scream as I am going in i can hear her scream louder and I go in and my daughter is holding her arm. My niece starts crying as I look at both of them saying my daughter hit her. My daughter was the only one screaming before I got there and the only one holding a limb with red marks on it. 

I ask what happened and from what both of them told me, apparently my daughter took the pillow that my niece had for her barbie and she said ""How dare you"" and then she grabbed my daughter's arm and was scratching her and my daughter pushed her away. My niece told me herself she did it due to taking the tiny pillow when I separated them. I told her that we dont use our hands and we dont need to fight about a tiny silly pillow. She needs to use her words and if she needs me to come and find me.


 I also told both of them (because this is an issue) that just because someone decides to touch, sit on, or play with something it doesn't mean that the other one has to demand a turn right away. We all have to wait our turn and you can't decide you want something cause the other one has it. (This began with my cousins daughter, but now my daughter does it in anticipation of her cousin doing it).

So when my cousin gets back a half hour later as soon as she sees her mom she starts balling saying my daughter hit her. I told my cousin what her daughter told me that happened, and what I told both girls, she agreed.

Girls start to play and my cousin is with them the entire time.

4. So the wind blows the door shut again and the 3 of them are in there and then I hear my daughter scream again and she comes running out of the room. Now her daughter is crying hugging her mom. I asked what happened and my cousin didn't reply. My daughter said she was sitting on her oversized unicorn stuffy pretending to ride it when her cousin came over and wanted it and my daughter saod no, so she pushed my daughter off of it. As soon as my daughter bolted her cousin got on it, stopped crying and called out to my daughter and said ""hey look at me I'm on it"" totally trying to upset her, and my cousin said and did nothing.

I just dont know what to do. When my daughter has been the culprit my cousin tells me and I speak to my daughter about it and have her apologize. But it is starting to become that her daughter is only spoken to in a way that you would speak to a baby or 1 year old.

She even hit her again when my daughter tried to hug her as she was leaving. Again silence.

1. She does not like being suddenly moved to the potty. Moving her once she starts peeing (aka 'Oh Crap' method) is not going to work. 
2. She has good communication skills for her age and, in particular, understands things quite well when they're explained to her. She may find watching/reading in detail about how a character acts helpful.
3. She will happily accompany us to the toilet and sit on her potty, asking to wipe and take part in the overall process. She will not often sit down for very long. 
4. She responds well to rewards. 
5. She clearly knows and understands the feeling of needing to poo. She can identify that she has done a wee but only when her nappy is off and she can see it.

Usually it’s me who gets up with her both days regardless because I’m already up and let’s face it, it’s part of my routine. Lately though, I’ve had really bad morning sickness so I’m trying to take advantage of the extra sleep. Today was the first time I was actually able to sleep in, and even then it was only an extra hour. I still felt exhausted, but took a quick shower then headed downstairs.

At that point in the morning, our daughter has only had m&amp;ms for breakfast and is screaming for more. She still has on her dirty diaper. The pets haven’t been fed. The house is a mess. He’s laying in the couch surrounded by the shit he was supposed to put away last night but didn’t, clearly. He gives me this look that says “I’m so tired you owe me big for this”. No. Fuck you. He then tells me that because I’m now awake, he can go back to sleep. Double fuck you. 

Fine, whatever I ask him to take out the recyclables and hang out for 10 more mins to entertain our daughter while I clean the kitchen. He gives me attitude about how the bin has no more room and if I think there is I should do it myself. Yep, I’m a nag because I don’t want his Diet Pepsi cans, which he always leaves 2-3 sips in the bottom for some reason, stinking and leaking in the kitchen. There was MORE than enough room, btw. He also doesn’t try to play with our daughter, but when she runs into the kitchen says half heartedly “come play” while she gets into the mess I’ve been trying to deal with. He finally comes over to take her away but only stands there saying “come here honey” and doesn’t do anything because he doesn’t want to piss her off then have to deal with her.

I’m so tired and annoyed and pissed off by that point I tell him to just go back to bed. He gives me more attitude and I ask him what he thinks he actually did to help this morning. True, he physically got our daughter out of bed and took her downstairs but seriously when it’s me getting up with her I take care of her, the pets, clean up, and have breakfast made for everyone by the time he saunters down at 11 after a 45 min shower saying he’s still tired.

He’s an amazing husband and father who is funny and sweet and kind and generous and so many other wonderful things. I love him to death but sometimes he can be so selfish. He works hard during the week and deserves a break, but so do I! I’m very lucky to be a stay at home mom and will always be grateful to him for enabling me to do so. I love that I’m able to spend so much time with my daughter, especially during Covid times but my “work” day doesn’t end at 5, and it certainly isn’t M-F. There are so few breaks and I’ve felt my whole identity has become “mom”, but that’s a rant for another time.

I guess I’m just mostly annoyed because with this pregnancy I’m not really getting any support from him other than the obligatory “how are you feeling”. This was very much a planned pregnancy we are very excited for. He’s told me it doesn’t feel real yet and it probably won’t until he can feel the baby kick, so that’s probably a big part of it. That doesn’t mean I’m not dealing with anything, and I wish he would be a little more sympathetic. Luckily, his amazing mom has been coming over to help me out while I’ve been feeling crappy. I’m truly so grateful to her, my husband, my daughter, and everyone. I’m so very lucky but with constantly feeling ravenous, nauseous, and so tired simultaneously it’s easy to blow things out of proportion.

I probably shouldn’t even be posting this, we’ll talk it out and re-evaluate what our new normal is going to be but I appreciate the outlet. It feels good to rant without blowing up at him further.

Potty training was the most frustrating thing I’ve ever gone through. But I see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

We started introducing the potty when my son was 2 (last August), he would sit on it every once in a while but showed no REAL interest in it. When he was around 2.5 he started to show interest and actually used it a couple times. we decided to try the “oh crap” potty method. We had some success but at the end of the 5 days he because VERY resistant to the potty and hated the high pressure tactics . This method was not for us. We decided to take a break for a month and try a more organic approach.

He is in daycare, so in may we started, no pants at home and NO diapers except for bed. So for June and July he was 50/50 at home with potty success. So in July his daycare teacher said hes been asking to use the toilet there and she thinks he’s ready! We thought awesome!

We decide to go cold turkey with diapers ! The first week went pretty well he was 75% on the potty at day care and home, with just 1 or 0 accidents a day. The next two week he was having accidents all day at home and day care. 

We thought maybe this is just a hump we have to push through. So we did one more week with no progress. It was worse than it was when we did the oh crap method. His teacher suggest to put him in diapers and not mention the potty for a couple weeks. 

Mind you he needs to be potty trained for the 3 year old room starting sept 1.

My son didn’t care about rewards, candy, cleaning up his mess (he thought it was fun), Cheerios in the toilet, none of these tricks worked. He’s very stubborn. 

We felt defeated. Then 3 weeks ago he just said “no more diapers , diapers are for babies” so we put him in underwear (expecting the worse). He’s been dry ever since . Poop , pee and he’s been dry at night.

One day we skipped nap entirely because it was already 3, and she still hadn’t fallen asleep (she woke up late that morning).

I can’t handle this anymore- some backstory: after transitioning to the toddler bed, we couldn’t get him to stay in bed, it evolved to one of us sitting in his room and then to sitting outside his door and making him go back until he fell asleep but that could take 2+ hrs til he was out enough we could leave- and he would freak when he woke up with out one of us there. We finally put a childproof door lock on his door so we could stop policing him and he would yell/be sad for a bit but get over it pretty quick and go to bed. We started opening his door when we went to bed so he could get up when he wanted in the morning.

After his sister was born in April he started waking up and wanting to come in our room in the middle of the night. We let him for a while, put some blankets and pillows next to the bed and it was fine. But after maybe a month or two, he would have some problem- need every pillow or blanket from his room, more water etc and then nothing was good enough, he’d just whine/moan, toss and turn and not sleep. As I didn’t want him waking his sister or keeping us from the little sleep we were getting with a newborn, that had to stop too. We stopped opening his door at night, he has to wait for us to come get him in the morning. 

In the last week or two, he’s started up again- waking up needing us for something but it’s never enough and he just wants us to stay and we can’t. 

I never wanted to be this parent, locking him in his room and listening to him yell ‘I have a serious problem mama! Help!’ (If he does, he can’t tell me what it is when I get there) and I’ve been reading parenting books and searching blogs (great, I know it’s a sign of other problems, he’s not giving us a hard time, he’s having a hard time, he’s watching too much tv etc) but I can’t figure out how to deal with the root problem/fix this fast enough for how little patience I have at 2 am.

There is a toddler proof thingy on his door so he can't escape.  

And NOW, he's decided that sleep is for chumps and hes not having any of that nonsense.  OMG, every two hours some nights he's awake screaming bloody murder.  

Here's what we've tried:
1) routine, routine, routine.  Bath at 6:30, bed at 7.  Read a story, kiss goodnight.  Screams his head off as soon as we leave his room.  

2) tried telling him we are right outside, we will be back in five minutes to check in him (and the variation of 'we will check on you when you are calm') and proceed to go in his room every five minutes.  He screams for over an hours.  

3) giving up and just sitting with him until he falls asleep.  Then he wakes up, discovers we are not there and screams.  

4) cry it out.  This is my preference, though my husband thinks it's what's giving him the anxiety in the first place.  I know it can be controversial, but damn if I haven't tried anything I can think of.  It's been this way for about a month now.

Hed been difficult ever since my husband went to work this morning. Yelling, throwing things at me, hitting, more screaming. All day basically.

And what makes it worse is he doesn't even look like me cause he's mixed. At first glance  people assume hes not even mine. Ive even been asked. Multiple times.

Up until about 6-8 weeks ago, she was fairly well behaved and an all around good kid. She would have her moments and get frustrated and cry, but she was fairly pleasant and easy to get along with. My GOD has she turned into an angry little nightmare the last few weeks. Pre-pandamic, we took regular trips to the grocery store and visited her Nana once a week to do laundry (that's fallen off due to her being in the middle of divorce and everything that comes along with that). She hasn't been on a regular errand trip since early March, when I found out I was pregnant with our second and began limiting almost ALL of my public exposure risks.

To make matters worse, She is an active and pretty smart kid, so we're pretty sure her boredom and lack of room to move in our 850 sq ft apartment are the main problem that's been compounding over the last 6 months. I work from home part time and manage \~80% of the house chores. Along with moving into my 3rd trimester next week, I'm also trying to plan and organize moving us all into a new place next month. 

What this all boils down to is that I am physically, mentally, and emotionally at the end of my rope.

Some of the steps I've taken are as follows:

* I've been reading articles on tantrums and books on dealing with willful children and problem behavior
* I removed a couple movies from our rotation that I realized she was modeling after (specifically Boo's tantrum from Monster's Inc.) 
* We take her to the park once almost every week and have started taking her on weekly ""field trips"" to places like the zoo and the aquarium
* I've also started taking very cautious weekly trips with her to Target and local craft stores during non-busy times and using our stroller (instead of a cart) to avoid as much Covid risk as possible.
* I've also made large strides to mask my stress around her so she does not feed off of it and have altered how I manage my own frustration so as not to give her any other bad examples.
* We're also starting to ween down TV time bit by bit so she can have more focused time with communications and her activities. (The TV we remove is replaced with music,)

It's only been about a couple weeks of working with her, but I don't feel like we're making a lot of progress. She gets so frustrated and so angry, SO fast, and she will just angrily scream over and over (anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min) at least 2-3 times a day (sometimes more). Almost always at home, to be clear.

Over the last few weeks, I've tried comforting, I've tried talking to her calmly about what she's feeling, and I've tried ignoring her fits altogether (that has been the strategy for the last week or two). I can keep my cool about 90% of the time, and just leave the room the other 10% of the time. For every step forward we take, it feels like we take another step and a half back and I just have too much on my plate to keep on with this trial and error.

Her dad does everything he can to help me, but he works 40 hours a week, and honestly she learned she can get away with more around him (something I warned him about when she was 18 months old). So, mostly I’ve been giving him pointers when he's around her to help avoid manipulation and just asked him to help more with the cooking and cleaning so I can focus more attention on her and my work (we need both incomes to survive).

I just don’t know how to teach her that anger and screaming is NOT the appropriate immediate response to even the slightest of frustrating situation. (Seriously, her blocks fall over and she FLIPS, even though she knows she can stack them back up, and does after about 30-60 seconds of yelling.)

Tl;dr My smart, active toddler has developed anger issues with screaming and yelling over the last 2 months. She is driving me, her 6-months pregnant work-from-home mother, INSANE.

My daycare tells me almost everytime shes there how good of a day she has and how happy she is! But then it seems when I have her shes a complete wreck. I just want a good day with her too :(. I know likely its because she misses me, but it makes it so hard to spend quality time with her because it feels like nothing makes her happy.

For example, I pick her up because shes crying to get up, but then she whines because she wants back down. She whines to go outside but then she cries because she's outside. She whines because she's hungry but then she hates everything I give to her. She has fun playing with a toy with me for all of 2 minutes before she starts raging and crying. I just feel so helpless during these times and like I'm doing something wrong.

Its just becoming very exhausting, because I work 12hour shifts as a nurse and when I do have days off I really miss her and want to have a good qualitu day because I hardly see her when I work. But, It never ends up being a good day because she is just a whiny clingy mess.

CIO/interval seems no longer working for him as he sounds SO upset and he puked a couple times.

Please give me any ideas.
My 2 to (almost 3) hasnt slept a full night since idk when.
She goes to bed initially pretty good. Sometimes she fights it, but usually stays in bed and goes right to sleep. But then wakes up all through the night. There is no pattern to what times she gets up/goes back down either. I'll try to give as much detail as possible so maybe someone has something I can do.
She's semi non verbal. She talks, but barely/rarely. (In speech therapy for it). 

Her bed time ritual has been the same since she was born and it worked great the first year or so.
About 7- Get in bath (lavender soap/bubble bath)
About 7:35- Get out of bath
Then spend about 15-20 minutes combing hair, putting lavender lotion on, diaper, clothes, say goodnight to dad, etc.
I carry her to bed and sing our bedtime song.  Lay her down. Walk out quietly.

Note: I mist her room with lavender while shes in the tub and also turn on white noise.

Now, she will almost instantly go to sleep. But from there she will wake up and not go back to sleep until practically dawn. Her wakeup time could be 10:30, 12, 1, 3....any time really. Theres no pattern.

Things we've been doing/trying other than what I've already said:

Rain noise instead of white noise

No noise at all

Calmly and quietly walk her back to bed as many times as it takes(I did this for 4 weeks straight and there was absolutely no change in her sleep at all from night to night) she would get up consistently until dawn. We all were SO miserable.

Letting her lay in the bed with us

Me laying in her bed with her

Me sitting beside her bed holding her hand

Me and her laying on the couch (her preference, but she doesn't want to sleep, she wants to play)

.5 mg melatonin

1 mg melatonin

Night light

No night light

Chamomile tea with honey

Closing her door (she just opens it and comes out)

Baby gate (she stands at it and screams a while, then just climbs over it)

Daytime nap

No nap at all

Snack before bed

No snack near bedtime

There are a lot more, I'm just having a hard time remembering. We've done absolutely every thing we can think of.

None of the things make a difference. Its the same thing every night. All she wants to do is get up, turn on lights, play, run around, watch TV, eat a snack....all the normal daytime things. Any attempt to get her to sleep makes her just cry and scream and basically thrash around. For her to sleep, it has to be her idea. 

The lack of sleep is really affecting us all. It makes her SO irritable and whiny. And it's starting to cause me health issues. Please, if anyone has any clue what's going on or ideas I can atleast try, let me know.

They're transitioning her slowly this week, and she's been playing with them partial days all summer due to low attendance. This has worked out really well for her, as she now knows the other kids, the teachers, a few of their routines, and overall I think this transition will go fairly smoothly \*fingers crossed\*. We're expecting her to come home more tired than usual for a bit, but hopefully nothing major.

My question is, what do you send your toddler to daycare with? We still have to send food, so we'll need to get her a lunchbox (I know everyone recommends Bento-style), but that's not what I'm questioning - we have the bag we've been sending her bottles in (working on that transition still) to hold us over until we get one.

She is allowed to bring a blanket for naptime if she wants. And she currently doesn't wear shoes until they go outside to play, so I've been sending all that in the diaper bag. But we don't really need to send the whole diaper bag anymore. Do we change our morning routine to add in putting on shoes before we leave, and then just send her with the blanket and lunchbag? I think there's still a change of clothes at the center that they'll transition to the new room. 

I keep trying to ask questions at drop-off, and DH asks at pick-up, but my time in the morning is limited because she's been crying at drop-off which means no time to ask questions.

He came out 5 minutes later looking pretty happy and pointing to go back in. He was also making the shuttering breathing sounds he makes after a big cry. Am i overthinking this?

But being working parents I’m sure we are not as diligent about letting him cry or anything since we all need our rest. My question is how did you guys get through it? Let them cry in their bed until they go to sleep or go in there? Getting to bed usually isn’t a huge issue but it’s the middle of the night waking. Almost clockwork after his Motrin has work off. We have used just about every remedy to soothe his teething pain but I think until they break through there’s not much else we can do. This mama is tired and wants her bed back!

He has always been an excellent sleeper since he was around 5-6 months, sleeping around 12-14 hours every night with the occasional off night. And usually 2-3 hour naps in the daytime.  


Currently, his schedule is roughly like this:

Wake up at 5:00 - 6:00 am every morning, no later than 6:00 am.

Play hard the entire morning.

Nap from 1:00pm-2:30pm, sometimes 3:00pm.

Play hard the rest of the day.

Then we settle down around 6:00 pm - 6:30 pm, and try to get him into his bed by 8:00 pm at the latest.

**This is where it starts to get very challenging for us.**  


He won't let us leave his bed until he falls asleep, most of the time we are in his room/bed from over an hour laying with him waiting for him to sleep. If we try to leave he will say ""Please don't leave me, please"" and basically beg us to stay. If we do leave, he screams like crazy and then just comes out into the living room screaming and crying. 

When he was still sleeping in his crib, we would just sing him a quick song, and then put him down, and he was sleeping within 5-15 minutes.

We moved him from his crib to a toddler bed about 2-3 months ago because he was constantly climbing in and out of the crib, and we didn't want him to get hurt. Basically once we moved him from the crib to the bed, all this change happened.

&amp;#x200B;

He has soft white noise music that we have had in his room since he was a baby, night lights, blackout curtains, his favorite stuffed animals, and no toys in his room to distract him. We have also tried several times with no naps in the day, and he still goes to bed around 8:00pm - 8:30pm and wakes up at 5:00-6:00am.  


Also, throughout the day he will go into his room and lay in his bed for a couple of minutes and you can just tell that he is tired because he isn't getting enough sleep. He does this multiple times a day.

  
**Also a side note, we are having a daughter the beginning of December, so this NEEDS to be resolved before then otherwise it's going to be brutal.**  


Does anyone have any advice you can give us? ***We would love for him to wake up around 7:00 am.***

I started with a small and unreliable workflow and worked my way into my current position making what is considered great money where I live. My daily workload takes about four hours to complete. Sounds great, but I am also the only one home to care for my son until my fiancé gets home around 6PM. As you can imagine, the days are hectic but fun!

My current schedule is not working. Not for me, my son, or my relationship with my fiancé. I wake up at 3:50AM to scramble to do as much work as possible, then spend the whole day with him sans his (and my) nap, then finish my work once SO gets home. Son goes to bed at 7:30 and I follow suite at about 8. My SO and I have nearly no time together. 

So I’ve been thinking of waking up around 6, getting about an hour of work in, then also working two one-hour increments during the day, as well as working through his nap (what I used to do when my son was an infant). 

My question is, is it realistic for a 2.5-year-old to entertain himself for an hour at a time? He’s very independent and has done it before, just not on a regular basis. We have plenty of toys and he stays near my desk anyway (we have one GIANT living room/kitchen/dining room that is completely open) so safety isn’t a concern. I just don’t want to be neglectful and I have zero experience with kids so I just don’t know if this is appropriate for his age or not.

Meal times with my two year old are stressful, to say the least. From the beginning, we’ve had a policy that states : “we serve you what we’re having. You don’t have to eat it. We’ll serve you something you like with every meal.” Our daughter is also very chunky (90%), so we  know she’s not starving to say the least, and are cognizant of not letting her fill up on junk foods. We also limit her milk and she gets no juice. However, she eats NO dinner. For awhile, she would just not eat anything we served her, but would eat a banana and at least sit there for a reasonable amount of time (reasonable being 5 or so minutes). 

But things have devolved significantly where she throws a fit of anything is on her tray she doesn’t want. She sits in a high chair, and we usually put her food on a plate. Now, she screams “all done” and hands us the plate, not letting us keep it on the tray. It’s gotten to the point that when walking down the stairs, she sees her plate, assumes she doesn’t want it, and screams “all done” and cries the whole way down the stairs, which also takes forever. 

Meals are miserable, with her crying, intermittently asking to get down, during which she will go to the kitchen and point to something else she wants - usually a banana, which we will sometimes give her, sometimes not depending on how many bananas she has had and how recent her last banana was - today, she had had a banana in the last 30 minutes so we said no. 

Tomorrow, we are going to try putting the food directly on her tray instead of a plate...she will probably throw it but at least she can’t hand us the whole plate. 

Also...she eats nothing. Our standard for what we want her to eat is not high. We had yellow rice, black beans, and chicken for dinner tonight, which she’s eaten other times and enjoyed, but seems to have forgotten. I think she eats about 10 foods, and we’re at our wits end. Any advice/ideas are appreciated. 

TLDR - my 2 year old eats only 10 foods, and throws a fit if we try to put anything on her tray she doesn’t want.",True,False,False,toddlers,t5_2ta5v,60491,public,self,Help with meal time,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/ifym67/help_with_meal_time/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are very communication focused at home and have spent a lot of time since before she could talk teaching her to take deep breaths to calm down and have taught her a ton of different words for emotions so she can adequately describe what she’s feeling. 

I thought she was just going through a yelling phase until today. Daycare emailed me to say she pushes and hits her peers at daycare. The teacher has tried talking to her calmly to no avail. Apparently they have been working on it for weeks but they don’t know what to do.

He can communicate very well with me and husband (only family around), and daycare caregivers say they understand them a bit. 

I am a bit worried about his socialization. Children his age are already speaking to each other a bit, right? And he can’t join. 

Also, he ended up watching too much TV over the last months (pandemic), and loves super hero’s stuff. He has been approaching other children with closed fists and pretend angry face. I talked to him on how we feel when we see someone angry and how we like smiles. Didn’t work yet.

What do I do to help him?

We take him to local places with lots of children and I help him modeling smiling, saying Hi, playing together, when we are at those places.  He doesn’t have such a “close” help on daycare. Which at first I thought it would be good, but now I am not sure.

He pushed one kid once, but nothing else to worry regarding violence. He is very possessive with his things, which I imagine is normal. He bonds with the caregivers, but they say he has no much interest in other children. 

He talks about the friends at daycare, generically. They eat, they pot, they were there. It’s been 3 months.

We've  been on the hunt for some good quality edutainment, and we have come  across some gems!  So, without further adieu, here are five children's  shows that are great for the whole family.  Enjoy!

\-----------------------------------------

**1.** [**Tinga Tinga Tales**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQLkOZV1aHXB0ihn2EwSbw) **on YouTube**

This is our **NUMBER ONE** children's show we have come across to date -- 11/10, so do yourself a favor and give it a watch.

[""Tinga Tinga Tales""](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQLkOZV1aHXB0ihn2EwSbw) brings you stories of why animals are the way they are.  Each episode is an **African Folk Tale**  on the creation of an animal and how it came to be the animal that it  is today (i.e. ""Why Baboon has a Bare Bottom"" or ""Why Porcupine has  Quills"").

The artwork and  animation are absolutely stunning, inspired by Tanazanian art, and the  entire series is informative, hilarious, and just plain fun for the  whole family.

Our only con? Ads... SO MANY ADS...

**2.** [**Pete the Cat**](https://smile.amazon.com/Pete-Cat-Season-Official-Trailer/dp/B08911SSPM/) **on Amazon**

Second on this list is a **relaxing** **(very important)** household favorite that combines beautiful art and storytelling with what it means to be a good person and live a good life.

Originally a book series, [""Pete the Cat""](https://smile.amazon.com/Pete-Cat-Season-Official-Trailer/dp/B08911SSPM/)  and his friends (each their very own unique and cool character) start a  band, The Resolutions, as a New Years resolution to keep the crew  together.

Each episode highlights a  different value / moral ranging from trying new foods three times  before saying you don't like it to the importance of being yourself  because you are you, and there's only one of you!

**3.** [**Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom**](https://www.netflix.com/title/80082160) **on Netflix**

The **most hilarious** show on the list, [""Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom""](https://www.netflix.com/title/80082160) has us CRACKING UP over the made-for-adults humor that accompanies every episode.

Ben  (an elf) and Holly (a fairy) live in the kingdom of Fairies and Elves,  fairies using their magic and elves using their wit.  Honestly, half the  time we couldn't even tell you what an episode is truly about, but we  can promise that **you'll have a good laugh while you watch**, and so will your little ones.

**4.** [**Puffin Rock**](https://www.netflix.com/title/80044965) **on Netflix**

Another **relaxing (and this is key)** show that's fun for the whole family is [""Puffin Rock""](https://www.netflix.com/title/80044965), a series about a little island off of what we're assuming to be the Irish coast.

This  fun and educational Netflix original follows two curious puffins, a  brother and sister duo, that find themselves exploring the island and  experiencing the many beauties of nature.

**5.** [**The (Animated) World of Eric Carle**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaP8Cm4cBidSbQdmmcJDUfsbcHe4z6GLl) **on YouTube**

This [short playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaP8Cm4cBidSbQdmmcJDUfsbcHe4z6GLl)  of some classics from Eric Carle that have been brought to life through  animation will have little readers of all levels listening and watching  intently as these colorful characters spark the imagination of your  little one.

This playlist helps us when we're winding down from a long day and need something with a **little less noise and a little more peace**.

\-----------------------------------------

Hope you all enjoy, and if you know of any other good ones, we'd love to hear!!

Around April, though, he had been waking up squirming and clearly uncomfortable and he was really getting too big for lap naps, so I transitioned him to his bed and he's been happy with that until about 2 weeks ago. I boobed to sleep from birth, but around February, he started leaving my breast to go to sleep at night without and I'd just stay in the room with him until he fell asleep. Also around April, he was clearly finding me too distracting and was just babbling and singing to himself, so I tried leaving and he went to sleep without complaint, I've been doing that ever since and I have to do the same at nap times. Normally, he sits up as I'm leaving and gives me a grin, a wave and a 'mum mum'.

Bedtime is still great, but naps are a nightmare. He will not unlatch at all but also won't go to sleep. If I unlatch him when he seems to have dropped off and isn't nursing anymore, he wakes up and cries and is literally screaming his head off until I let him latch on again. I was managing to get him to sleep that way by just waiting him out and eventually he would fall asleep properly and I could leave, but the last two days have been totally different. Instead of falling asleep nursing, he's just insisted on staying latched on and refused to nap, kicking, slapping his legs and playing with his feet to keep himself awake. I stayed in there an hour and a half today and it was clear there was no way he was going to go to sleep with me in there.

I'm not at all in favour of CIO, but I couldn't see another way to convince him to sleep. Yesterday and today, I had to leave while he was crying and as soon as I shut the door, he calmed down, but then I heard little sobs through the monitor until he finally fell asleep about 10 minutes later. It's horrible, it's not what I want, I don't want him to just quietly cry himself to sleep, that's just heartbreakingly awful, but I'm also clearly keeping him awake.

Sometimes he gets so upset he bangs his head into the ground, he will continue to hurt himself and if I try and pick him up he will hit me, kick me, bite me and head butted me. I would say he has about 80-100 violent fits (if not more) per month. I have started trying to ignore the fits to avoid getting hurt but it seems like it makes things worse. Some fits are minor and end quickly, some days are better than others and sometimes it’s like he’s the sweetest boy in the world who could never throw a tantrum. I watched a YouTube video about if your child is throwing a fit to start playing with other toys and ignore them while they throw their fit and then they will stop and come play with you. It actually worked like a charm. However, I might be cooking, sanitizing bottle parts or tending to my baby so I can’t always do it. If we stop a fun activity because I have a important phone call or something he will just freak out and it could last hours. He sleeps well at night and takes a 2 hour nap daily, sometimes 3.He’s a picky eater and has low levels of iron, about 2 days ago I started him on a iron supplement. He also chews on walls non stop, I’ve basically given up on trying to stop him (my doctor told me not to pay attention to it)Any who, do you all this behavior is normal? I can’t help but think my son has some serious behavioral issues and with covid everything has been closed. I could really use some advice on how to work with him. I don’t feel my doctor has given me very many resources: I did some googling and now I’m super worried. Advice please.

He kicks and cries through diaper changes and has been telling us after he poops, so we figured we’d give potty training a try. He’s been naked since yesterday where he had 2 pees in the potty while watching tv and a few accidents around the house. Today he’s had no accidents, but he’s holding his pee and not wanting to go in the potty. 

At this point, it’s clear from his body language that he knows when he has the urge to go, but when we take him over to the potty he refuses. We started yesterday with the approach of taking him every 30 minutes and he quickly got annoyed. When we realized he wouldn’t just pee everywhere we backed off and waited for him to start wiggling and squatting before running him over. Today he had one pee late morning because, after giving him a lot to drink, we took him into the bathroom to wash his hands, hoping that would help him start. It did, and as soon as he was peeing I turned him to angle it into his potty. He was mesmerized by the stream and so excited to help dump it out and flush the toilet. He seemed so proud, and he got some chocolate chips as a potty treat.

After lunch we tried another pee before nap time, thinking it would be less of a struggle since he was so excited last time. Unfortunately he still refused. We aren’t forcing him to sit on it, just reminding him about all the fun things that came with peeing in the potty. We tried the water trick again, but he was onto us and didn’t want to wash his hands. We gave up and tried to put on a diaper for nap time, and he kicked and cried like usual, then peed a tiny bit from the struggle. We ran him to the potty and sat him down and he finally let loose. 

What concerns me is that while peeing, he was still crying from the diaper change and kept saying “uh oh”, like he thought he wasn’t supposed to be peeing in the potty. We kept encouraging him and cheering him on, but he kept saying “uh oh”. Once he stood up afterward and saw the pee he got so excited again, clapped, and was so excited to help dump and flush again.

Anyone else had this happen or have advice? He’s very stubborn and very independent, wants to do everything himself like brushing his teeth and washing his hands, so I’m wondering if it’s just another power struggle because the potty wasn’t his idea? We haven’t scolded him in any way for not using the potty, so I just can’t figure out why he was saying “uh oh”.

10-12pm: Playtime/Snack
12:30-1:30: Lunch
2:30-3: Nap (2 hours)

7-9: Family time
9: Get ready for bed
10ish: Asleep

The variation in time usually depends on what I or we are doing that day.  Also the gap between milk and breakfast I think is rather long but the milk tends to hold him over. If try to give him breakfast any sooner he's usually not interested.

We've tried skipping naps and he does ok but by 6ish he starts showing the effects of a skipped nap.  Another thing we think may make it difficulty for us to shift his schedule too much, is that he's a slow eater.

I told her (stupidly) this is a picture of Mommy's momma, and she isn't here anymore. She's gone. And sometimes that makes momma sad. And it's okay to be sad sometimes. 

I did not think any of this through like I should have beforehand, but it would have required a lot shifting beforehand to not have her with me- would have been impossible.

She will say dada and occasionally mama and baba, but apart from that doesn’t say any real words. She’s been doing that for nearly a year and hasn’t made any real progress. Since she started morning preschool she’s been vocalizing a lot more, but it’s just gibberish.  She also used to mimic a few animal sounds but won’t really do it any more and I know that any regression at this age is concerning. 

I know she understands things like no, milk, come here, pacifier, night night, and character names like Moana and Mickey Mouse, but she doesn’t understand complex sentences. 

It’s so frustrating because she’s old enough to have strong opinions, but not able to communicate them. I just wish she could tell me what she wants to eat so it’s not a daily struggle. 

She has some ways of communicating, like she will scratch my stainless steel water bottle and make a sound when she’s thirsty, she’ll bring me her shoes if she wants to put them on, etc. 

Apart from speech, I’ve read a billion “early signs of autism” lists and none of it sounds like her. She’s bright, social, engaged, she loves other kids, she likes looking at faces and makes eye contact, she looks to us for our reactions to things, generally just loves people. 

She was delayed in walking as well, she wouldn’t walk unassisted until 20 months, but then it was like a switch flipped and she took off running. Her vision and hearing has been checked and appears to be fine. 

We finally got a referral to speech therapy this February, but because of Covid we had to wait to begin until July. She’s been going 1 or 2 mornings a week, which is great, but it’s tough to discern any “progress” over such a short time. The speech therapist confirmed my thoughts that she has an upper lip tie, and I was finally able to get a referral to an ENT for next month for an evaluation. 

I’m just so frustrated / depressed about this, for myself and my husband and for her. I know there are things she wants to tell us but just isn’t able to. 

I’ve read a million resources, blogs, instagrams, etc, and try to do all the right things like saying “This is a ball” instead of “Can you say ball....” I’ve bought a bunch of “learning” toys for colors, numbers, ABCs, animals, and tried to reach her with them, but she shows no interest besides generally just playing with them. She loves books but mostly likes to look at the pictures, she’ll turn the pages while I’m reading to get to the next page. I feel like such a terrible parent, that I’m failing her somehow. 

Has anyone had a similar experience where their toddler eventually just “got it” and started talking? How long into speech therapy did you observe any progress? 

Any experience with a lip tie revision helping delayed speech?

Parents of preemies with delays - when did your kids eventually “catch up?” We were told she should be caught up developmentally by her second birthday, and she’s there for height and weight but that’s about it. 

I feel like I’m getting so desperate here and it would be so helpful to hear about other parent’s experience with speech delays, and any tips or suggestions that helped you.

But for lunch and dinner, its 85% of the time a struggle. If she eats a big lunch she essentially won't eat dinner and vice versa. She also LOVES whole wheat crackers with almost every meal. If she doesn't want something she'll spit it out. So if i put a cracker with it, like chicken for example, she might take a few bites.

So by day 3 she was associating potty with pain and REFUSED to go anywhere near the potties, instead running around the house crying and leaking ALL DAY LONG. We took her to the Pediatrician, just to be sure it wasn't a UTI (it wasn't) and he said to stop potty training and go back to diapers, and we agreed that Potty=Pain is not a great beginning to Potty Training.

It's been a few weeks and even though she's back to easily using the diaper for pee and poops, she has continued to poop at night too. Not every night, just twice a week or so. Sometimes it's a nasty blow out, which she doesn't really do during the day. She had NEVER pooped at night (after infancy) so I am at a loss. We have been applying vaseline every night before bed, but she's still getting burns. I have no idea at what point in the night she is pooping and she doesn't call for us or cry and I'm not sure she is even awake. I try not to go in her room because her door is loud (despite the white noise) and I don't want to wake her, but I'll do it if I have to.

What to do? Is this a phase? Should I just start checking on her throughout the night? Should I wait for an after-dinner poop before putting her to bed? We do kinda eat dinner and head to bed shortly after.

It got me thinking about how much differently we parent now that we have 2 instead of 1.

We're pretty chill parents who love to have fun but set clear and consistent expectations, so our household is a little crazy, but full of laughs and functions pretty well. Our oldest is coming up on 6 this fall, and our second is nearly 1.5 years. We don't want any more biological children, so I'm really enjoying toddlerhood much more this time around. 

Our second is SO MUCH crazier than our first. He climbs everything. He's figured out how to push toys around to reach the windows and somehow he can climb up and stand on the frame of a closed window. How!?? He climbs out of the tub. He climbs on top of the play kitchen. He steals food if he can reach it. Instead of signing when he's done (or saying ""done"" now that he actually says quite a few words) he throws food and cackles. He'll climb into the dining chair behind the older kid and try to push him off just to try to take his food or toys, even if he has food or toys of his own. Of course they both laugh and shriek like maniacs the whole time. We don't keep dining chairs in the living or dining room because he'll use them to climb the dining table and try to touch the light fixtures. And because he still hasn't been great about sleeping through the night and the big one is a light sleeper, my husband and I haven't slept on a bed together in months.

Did I mention the toddler regularly wakes up at 5:30 am and won't go back to sleep?

But I can't help but love how completely crazy he is. I never look up milestones like I did obsessively with our first. I'm not trying to rush him to the next phase. We don't even really mind the shitty sleeping arrangement right now because we know toddlers hit rough patches but grow out of them and then one day they're not running around in just a diaper, slapping their own bellies while dragging a stuffed bunny everywhere, with sticky little smiles. 

With our first, every rough patch or rut felt like it would never end. Or it felt like we were failing because it clearly was our fault that a young toddler suddenly went back to newborn sleep patterns or cried all week for daycare drop off. But now that we've lived through it, we know how temporary but wonderful this is. 

All I know is that he has learned to blow kisses and say ""TA DA!"" and actually understands a lot of what I tell him these days, so I love it.

We originally started doing this to get her used to sleeping on the cot for a trip we have coming up. But she’s liked it and done so well that she started asking to sleep on the cot for bedtime most nights. Seemed like a big win for us because we thought it will make it very easy to transition her to a big girl bed soon. Maybe even after our trip. 

Fast forward to early this morning. I hear her calling for me around 5am which is earlier than her wake up time. So I go into her room, explain that it’s still bedtime. She goes pee in the potty, washes hands, and asks if she can listen to twinkle on her hatch nightlight until it’s time to get up. I say sure, because win win for me, I can go back to bed. I tell her she can lay down or play quietly in her room until the hatch turns to the ready to wake light. But told her she has to stay in her bedroom. She’s super excited and I’m excited to get a little more shut eye. 

630am rolls around and I hear the music turn off which means it’s time to get up. I use the speaker on the monitor to tell my girl she can come out of her room now. She comes running into our room and tells me she pooped. Groggily I brush it off but then panic sets in. 

“Where did you poop?” 

“In my pants! Because you said I couldn’t leave my room!”

On Wednesday's and Tuesday's I am home with him and other days he goes to daycare or grandma. 

Recently I have noticed that he whines a lot when he is with me. It started to really irritate me because I try to give him attention. But when the whining gets too much I take him for a walk with the stroller which helps because he is distracted.  Today I wanted to try something new. I made a schedule of eating, playing together, playing alone and sleeping. I spent time playing with him this morning and then told him: ""mommy is going to do something for herself now. You can play alone"". And I walked away. He played alone for a few minutes then came to me and started whining again. I ignored him and after a few minutes he would give up and play alone again. He came back to whine again later and this repeated a few times but I felt like it worked. 

At one point I decided to watch some tv and he came and stood and watched as well. (No whining at this point so I was okay with it) after a minute he started to get tired of standing and climbed up on the couch to sit next to me. We watched tv together and then I suddenly noticed he had fallen asleep!  This has never happened before. He usually only sleeps in his bed. 

I am now wondering if the whining has maybe something to do with a lack of sleep and that is why he fell asleep on me? Maybe he isn't feeling well? Or would it be because of my pregnancy?

I also have a four month old (going through a sleep and nap regression - yay!) and I'm being run ragged with potty training, what with cleaning up messes,rushing her to the potty and being so fucking energetic and happy even when I'm really pissed off that it's exhausting.

I thought she was ready because she kept taking off all her clothes and diaper we've had the potty sitting outside the bathroom for a while now, telling her she will be using it soon. 

Well the other day she pulled her clothes off and took off her diaper and was running around naked. She abruptly stopped what she was doing and ran to the potty, went poop and pee. I couldn't believe it! I was overly happy as I heard that is what you need to do. I gave her two smarties as a reward. I decided that the next day we'd try potty training for real, she'd either be naked or in a dress (no undies or diaper) for the first few days so she can quickly sit down and go. Three days in and she has gone maybe three times on the potty. I put her on it once an hour and I watch her like a hawk. Several times I see her giving cues and I get her to race her stuffed toy to the potty. I tell her she won't be missing any play time, we will play once she's done. Every time I see her giving cues and she sits down, seems like she tries to go but she won't. We sit there for quite a while, until she is fussy and won't sit any more. I read books or sing songs to her and she likes that. Well every time she gives a cue but doesn't go on the potty she goes as soon as I am not watching her like an absolute hawk. I tried giving her privacy on the potty but she won't sit there by herself. 

I want to give up as it's been three days and each day is worse than the last. Will this confuse her too much? Anyone try potty training and then stop? How did that go?

someone suggested our plight might suit better here..

so we did have our kiddo sleeping through the night for a few weeks at 12months, however soon after she got sick and we've never got close to where we were, only further away.

She is just over 16months now and while we had got down to 1-2 boob feeds a day, she has gone back up to like 5-6.

Previously I took her to bed, gave her some milk in a cup, read to her etc. It wasn't simple/easy but she went over after an hour.

Now she wont let me at all, she screams blue murder for her mother, doesn't want to read. Goes crazy at me singing/rocking her and is screaming for her mum. So now she's basically going straight on the boob at nighttime and hopefully my wife still has enough milk to satisfy her or all hell breaks loose.

We've been trying really hard to reduce the dependence on the boob feeds but she really isn't taking solid food well at the moment. We're a little unsure if we should be retrying food, offering something different or what? I know realistically we shouldn't offer something else but if we don't it just seems to put extra strain on my wife. For example, this morning she got half a Weetabix and some fruit puree (she would have demolished this and more at 12months.). She refused more, informing us she was all done, then demanded milk from my wife.

There just seem so many things mixed in, I don't know where to turn for help. Any decent subreddits for toddlers and food/behaviour issues? Are we doing the right thing by attempting to focus on more solids to reduce dependence on boobs?

The night time routine rejection sucks, I'm really not sure how to re-establish a good one if she's screaming at me when trying to read a book to her..

We are about to kick her out into her own room and attempt sleep training once it's ready but weren't going to change anything until then.

A few weeks ago I posted about feeling burnt out with pretty much everything from covid quarantine, to my son possibly being on the spectrum, and having a newborn. The amount of support I got was the big fuzzy hug of support I needed. 

My son is still being evaluated for autism but we have started therapy twice a week. He is attending  occupational and educational. Right now his attention span isn't long enough to start speech therapy, so we're waiting on that. His vocabulary has definitely improved and his repetitive sounds have stopped mostly. Lots of new words and some two word phrases! (Still considered behind for 27 months though). The tantrums haven't been as extreme either. I'm hoping all the growth is here to stay, it's a rocky road with him.. Somedays are awesome and some have me in tears wondering if I'm raising a sociopath. I hear that's relatively normal for living with toddlers in quarantine though. Blippi has been a savior, my son loves dancing to his songs and asking me to join in. I think blippi has helped a lot with his speech and mood honestly. And I've learned a lot from blippi too! Mainly just how to be goofy with my son.. I'm usually more of a fan of deadpan humor so being silly and weird doesn't really come naturally. We are also ""casually"" potty training which is going pretty well! No stress is best in my opinion but who know this may not work.

As for me I have gotten some antidepressants and am going to therapy. And so is my SO. Our relationship is the strongest it's ever been and I'm so grateful to have a wonderful partner through all this. I still have my ups and downs though. Quarantine life is tough. I hope life can go back to normal but I'm feeling pessimistic about that and the world I'm bringing these babies into. I know I can't control it but sometimes the existential dread seeps into my mind and it feels so damn heavy.

Right now she seems far more aware of the need to poop than pee and will go hide by the toilet and sing the song from Daniel Tiger about going to the bathroom. She’s started to try and take her diaper off when she poops and is obsessed with watching us when we use the restroom. But she does not care about pee. 

Changing her diaper if it’s just pee is an Olympic event, we have to chase her down, catch her and hold her still. Using the toilet will make this much less miserable for us all but I’m just not sure if she is fully ready since she doesn’t seem to recognize when she has to pee yet.

Because we like having jobs our kids have been continuing at daycare through the plague-times. We have gotten a handful of incident reports through our 27-month old's time there, but in the past few months more frequently than normal (like 4-5 in the past two months) of her having altercations with another (unnamed) child. Sometimes it seems like she was the instigator, sometimes the other one was, and sometimes it seemed like a misunderstanding.

I guess we don't really have much of a barometer of how often is too often to scratch another child, I guess any more than zero is not ideal, but I would assume this happens from time-to-time. When we got the incident reports it was just explained to us very matter-of-factly what happened, not like this is becoming a problem and if it doesn't get better there will be consequences.

So today there was another altercation, and it turns out it's been the same kid she's been fighting with (I didn't know it was always the same kid), and that kid's parents are very upset. So they have to move my daughter out of the classroom and have offered to put her up with the two-and-a-half year olds. Which is a fair thing to do, I guess, I just wish I knew a little sooner that things were that bad so that I could have worked harder to do something about it. We're just in our little family bubble, and don't have a lot to compare to in terms of what's normal vs. what needs to be addressed.

Of course in retrospect I probably should have done more regardless, even if I didn't think it was ""that bad"". Not that my daughter runs around the house like a little terror or anything (I mean kind of, but not violently), if she gets in a fight with her brother we try to address it appropriately. But we probably spoil her a good bit and tend to avoid or remove situations that may cause big emotions, so she doesn't have as much practice dealing with them. 

So I will start filing her nails more often, let her out of her comfort zone more so we can teach her how to deal with it, and she goes to the bigger kid classroom tomorrow.

My son is 22 months, and the most precious person in my world. I got pregnant through IVF and found out it worked the day before my dad’s funeral. He’s got me through so much and I adore him.

But he likes to see me suffer! 

Generally he’s a very gentle boy, but he’s started scratching, pinching, biting &amp; slapping. Usually when he doesn’t want to nap or when he’s bored. He doesn’t do it ‘aggressively’, as in he’s not tantruming or cross...he laughs when we yelp in pain or tell him no. I think it’s our reaction he finds funny. 

I try to take his hand &amp; say ‘no’ or ‘be gentle’ (a word we use a lot when petting the dog etc, so he kind of knows what it means), and then distract him.

Is this the best solution? Are there other things I could be doing? I’ve looked into books about being gentle, but wasn’t sure he’d understand at his age? 

He goes to nursery 1 day a week, and apparently is very kind &amp; gentle with the other children, which is more important to me than how he treats me. I’m encouraging him to be less heavy handed with the dog (and always supervise), and generally he doesn’t get too rough with him either. It seems to just be me &amp; dad!

His pediatrician thinks it’s great and seems to think it works itself out, she just warned me that his communication milestones might be a little behind. He knows tons of words in both languages, he also answers “I don’t know” properly or “I know” when we try to show him something.

One time she was handed her a full banana, usually I slice it into small pieces or cut it vertically.

I just came to lay down in the other room and take a moment...and realized it’s still quiet and peaceful out there! Am I being too controlling or trying too hard to keep my 2yo engaged, learning, doing art/playing in the dirt/baby pool—doing different activities etc? Do I need to step back and just let things be a little more—let him engage in this independent play when he goes for it?

He would still eat most things, but he decided he wanted to further his independence and not let me spoon feed him. I thought ‘fair enough’ and have since let him eat by himself. Even when it was a messy meal like bolognese or curry, I’d still let him self-feed. This meant he was eating a bit less than usual but I did try to up his portions where I could. He hasn’t really grasped the use of cutlery just yet so he prefers to eat with his hands. 

He will be turning 20 months this month and he is literally becoming fussier by the day. Not only this, but he will take ages to eat a meal, maybe an hour or so. Is this normal? He also will only really be excited to eat anything potato like: e.g. chips, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes and his veg intake has become limited and some days he will eat it and some days he won’t. If I offer him kiddie snacks like crisps etc. he will instantly go for them them, but he just won’t eat full proper meals like he used to. He does eat cheese and yogurt. Basically his diet is now every limited despite me always offering different foods. More recently, he has been refusing meals all together, sometimes skipping it but doesn’t seem to be fussed about it. He also sleeps through the night most nights. He is still pooping as normal and weeing as normal. 

He is down to just one 6oz bottle of milk a day, but I now worry he isn’t getting enough food or calorie intake. 

I’d really love some advice around encouraging him to eat his meals (new or ones he used to like before he went on strike!). I’ve tried/try lots of things:
1. Eating with him, I try to encourage our family to eat together so he can watch from us
2. Making meals more exciting and can be eaten by hand so easy for him to eat 
3. Reduce snacking so he can be hungrier
4. Try and get him out to run around and tire himself out/build appetite. 

Is this a normal toddler thing? If so, how long does it go on for? I feel like he has been losing a bit of weight - definitely since he turned 1 but thought part of this was due to him being able to walk and he never stops moving!

 Thought to post here since nothing is coming up on the search engines specific to my question. When are you supposed to validate a toddlers feelings? Is it before they throw a tantrum, during, or after the tantrum when they're all calmed down and have switched emotions? I've read so many blogs, posts, and articles that says validating feelings helps speeds up the tantrums and calms them faster. But I thought not saying anything and just be calm helps them with that which I've tried but I often feel like I miss the window of opportunity to validate their feelings because they're attention is instantly switched to the cat that just walked in or on a logo on my shirt. Talk about frustrating. And when I try to speak while they're crying or having a fit I feel like I'm not being heard over the loudness or they don't want to hear me and their cries just drown out my voice because I'm speaking softly. I'm sure shouting validations will only escalate their emotions during their tantrums and it'll escalate mine as well.

My son is 18mo and I'm a little concerned about his attention span or a few key skills that I think he should possibly have by now - for instance, he can't/won't/doesn't try to stack one block on top of another, can't/won't/doesn't try to drive a toy car back and forth... 


Essentially it feels like whatever activity I provide, he'll run to it, dump it on the floor/knock it off the table/throw it aside, and then he's done. If it's an activity where he can perform this 'destructive' behaviour more than once (eg throwing water from a cup in the bath, picking up and dropping handfuls of dry rice) he can retain attention for a good while, but otherwise once the jigsaw or blocks or whathaveyou have been knocked to the floor, he's done (apart from wanting to step on them as he leaves!)


SO. My hunch is that he's just kind of 'in that phase' at the moment, he wants to explore how things fall and drop, and that's ok... But my question I guess is, how much should I be encouraging him to play in other ways, and how should I go about encouraging him? At the moment I'll start off an activity, say blocks, and I'll narrate ""I'm going to put this block on top of this one, see if I can make a tower"" and start sort of playing with it myself, in the way I'd like him to play. Then when he knocks or throws the blocks, I'll say something like ""oh crash! They all fell down!"" and then start again, just trying not to make a big deal really... But it gets pretty demoralising when he's just essentially running through whatever activity I'm trying to show him. Maybe that's just a me problem?

I have tried traditional approaches (white noise, night light, black out curtains, etc), researched and sworn by approaches (no screen or food 1-2 hours before bedtime), hippy crunchy ones (essential oils, massages). I have tried melatonin. I have read every stupid book under the sun for sleep training since this child was 6 months old (seriously, if someone suggests Happiest Baby one more time in my life, I may throw up). I am absolutely 100% angry and also guilt-ridden because who the fuck can't get their own child to sleep? The one thing humans should naturally be able to do?

He has nothing medically wrong. No acid reflux, no snoring/breathing issues, ear etc. The ONLY issues he has he was supposed to have addressed at early preschool with therapies and an IEP but because of fucking covid, it is all remote and kids like mine, who literally can't or won't sit down for even 1 minute let alone 30+ minutes, will get tossed to the side. 

All his doctors can say is at minimum, he is has too much energy. At most he is ADHD and/or borderline ASD. He aged out of early intervention and we can't afford private therapies. Also, no, letting him get his energy out through running and playing outside doesn't work. 

We have tried eliminating certain foods and all that crap, nothing changes. 

He doesn't nap. Hasn't since he was a 1 year old. His sleep is literally 8PM-11PM, then he wakes up and won't fall asleep again until sometimes 3AM. Then he still wakes up between 7-8AM. Everything I read tells me he doesn't get nearly enough sleep. 

But he never ever acts or even gets tired. He doesn't get crankier, he doesn't have meltdowns, or any of the other signs of terrible sleep in a kid. It's like he doesn't need it at all. 

We have literally had a night where we gave up. His dad and I just said fine, stay up as late as you want. Know what happened? WE got tired and fell asleep. He stayed up until 5AM, fell asleep, woke up at 8AM begging for food, and went about his day. HOW?!

To make it even better I am 30 weeks pregnant. So I am already not sleeping well, mixed with a toddler who hates sleep but can't tell us why, and will be dealing with the newborn sleep in just 7-10 weeks. 

It's so bad none of our family members will take him overnight for when we deliver, because they cannot deal with the level of sleep deprivation he still causes at 3 years old. 

I'm just so done. I give up. At this rate my newborn will sleep better than this damn kid. I try to be patient seeing as how MAYBE his possible issues could be causing the sleep issues, but after 3 years of never getting a break sleep wise, I am just resentful. I hate other parents who have good sleepers and still whine about being tired. I don't want to hate them, I just feel so incredibly jealous.

Early verbal, very vocal, and has more opinions than there are minutes in a day. And boy is she LOUD. But sometimes there’s these redeeming moments where my little black heart just bursts because she’s so damned cute. 

Bedtime has been a bit of a struggle for us recently. She fights it hard. Starts with stalling, then some nights moves on to full on tantrum meltdowns. One night in a very desperate last move, I thought back to my days of trying to kennel train our now 5 year old dog. I’d give the puppy the shirt I wore all day to trick him into thinking I’m there because my smell is. Worked for my dog, should work for my kid, right?  Jokes on me because it did. And now it’s stuck. Most nights she asks for my shirt. “Can I cuddle with your shirt, mama?” Sure, baby girl. Whatever you need to give up the ghost and go to sleep. So I strip off whatever t-shirt I had on that day, hand it over to my ToddTerrorist, and sneak out of the room topless hoping my neighbors don’t see me. 

But tonight, I go back in a few hours later to do my nightly check and pull up the blanket she kicks off religiously and that little black heart of mine got a nice jump start. In the glow of my cell phone light I see that she has my t-shirt cuddled up so tight and close to her face. She fell asleep cuddling my shirt because she needed me and my scent to drift off to dreamland.

Potty Training method. I’m on block two, which means we had success with peeing and pooping naked, and now my son is going around commando.

I thought we were doing really well because he didn’t need any prompting while naked. He would just run for the potty on his own. Often while saying “Go right away” under his breath (we’ve watched the Daniel Tiger episode a few times). We’re also nap and nighttime training and he’s a pro at holding it. He’s gone the whole night 3 times in a row now without peeing.

However, now while wearing shorts he’s having constant accidents and is resisting hardcore. It’s the same song and dance every day. He wakes up in the morning or from his nap in the afternoon and will not sit on the potty. Within 30 min of waking up he becomes visibly uncomfortable, clearly has to pee, until he eventually can’t hold it any longer.

I’m pretty sure I’ve tried everything the book has suggested. I’ve tried the casual prompt and walk away. I’ve offered to help him take off his shorts. I’ve tried to offer to sit and read next to him. I’ve demonstrated his toys going on the potty. I’ve sat on the potty. We’ve even had a major show down where he asked me for something and I responded “yes you can have that after you sit on the potty while I read you two books”. This led to the worst meltdown he’s ever had. 

My son is what you might call “spirited” personality wise. I knew going into this he would be resistant - that’s what he does. It didn’t surprise me that he did well with little prompting. But now I’m watching him contort himself with the struggle to hold his pee in, and then wail and cry when he pees himself. He’ll even attempt to avoid it by asking me to sit on me (for emotional or physical comfort maybe?) until he inevitably pees on both of us.

What am I doing wrong? I feel like throwing in the towel. Maybe in a year I can actually reason with him and we’ll have more success.

We’ve tried a lot of things now. Staying by his side (on our guest bed, him in the cot), walking out and staying out, telling him sternly, telling him softly, singing. Just about anything we could think of. 

It used to be as simple as making a small tut to make him reposition himself to an ""acceptable"" sleeping position. Now if I do it, he laughs at me. I tell him, it’s bedtime, he laughs, I gently, but firmly put him down, he laughs so hard I think he might burst.

The more effort we put into it, the more he laughs. It’s seriously annoying, and tempers can run a little high. I’ve said the word no more times than I would like. I want to be better at A. Helping him sleep, and B. Regulating myself when he’s challenging me.

He doesn’t understand the verbal commands and will only mimic general dancing and clapping.

Once the free play and “stations” begin though, he mostly blends in with the crowd except for his boundless energy. He will more eagerly approach teachers and catch onto activities, likely because they’re physical and not verbal.

I posted this on r/legaladvice but didn’t get anything from there, so I’m hoping some of you here might have experience/knowledge about this.


Because of COVID-19, my husband and I are looking at making our Wills, and I have a question about our child’s guardianship should both my husband and I die.

We are currently in Ohio, and if both of us die we’d like my child to stay with my parents. However, my parents are not in the US and it would probably take them at least 36 hours to get here (but likely longer due to travel restrictions). When my husband spoke to a lawyer, the lawyer said the child would stay with CPS until whoever we name in our Will gets here, which I would like to avoid. 

Is there a way to get someone (friend, neighbor, my cousin who lives 1,500 miles away) to take care of my kid until my parents get here? Is there such a thing as a temporary guardian that we can name?

Typical anxious dad here with a two-year-old boy that I love with all my heart. He was a big boy when he was born, nearly ten pounds, and most of his physical milestones came a little later than typical (by maybe a month), the doctor said it was likely because of his large size. But eventually when he started crawling, he didn't stop. By a little over one year old, he started slowly walking and within the next couple weeks, we couldn't get him to stop walking! My point is that when he learns to do something ""new"", he seems to really love exercising that ability. When he finally learned to walk (he uses his hand for stability) up the stairs, he started doing it all the time just ""for fun"" haha.

Anyway, fast forward to now, he just recently turned two years old and my wife and I are started to get worried because he doesn't say any words...kind of. Or he does, but very rarely and somewhat randomly. He babbles and yaps and does ""baby talk"" ALL THE TIME and has been doing that since he was really young. Lots of times when he's playing with his toys, he will be babbling out loud the whole time - he sometimes sounds like he's speaking Chinese!

My wife started using Sesame Street ""Number / Letter of the Day"" videos to teach him basic letters and numbers. She also found an instructional video for basic sign language that includes things like ""more"", ""all gone"", ""please"", and ""thank you,"" things like that. 

Whenever he watches these videos and one of the letters or numbers shows up, he instantly recognizes and says it. Obviously some of the numbers he has a little trouble with pronunciation (for example, ""six"" is more like ""sis"" and ""one"" is ""oon"") but he is consistent with his pronunciations and it very obvious that he recognizes the numbers. He can easily recognize and say numbers 1 through 10 aloud. He is the same way with most of the alphabet. He will repeat them when he's watching the Sesame Street video. He can utter probably 18 of the 26 letters, with a few tough ones that he has trouble saying (Q, X, W, J). Similarly, whenever we play the sign language video, he will mimic the lady in the video perfectly. She will say ""MORE"" and push her fingertips together, and my son will push his fingertips together and say ""muh"" (and a few times he said the full word with the ""r"" sound at the end). Same with please (belly rub) and thank you (he does the hand-to-mouth motion and says ""dah"" haha).

The other day, I took some note papers and drew the numbers 1 through 10 on them. Just as I'd hoped, whenever I show him a card, he will happily say the number on the car. He gets it right every single time.

AND YET - my wife and I absolutely cannot get him to mimic or imitate us. He will occasionally say ""bye"" and pinch his fingers together (his version of a wave). What's funny is that he does it at all the ""right"" times - like when he's going up for bed, sometimes he'll say ""bye"" to me downstairs. Or when we're watching Mickey Mouse and the episode is finished, he'll say ""bye"" as if he's saying goodbye to the episode lol.

However, when my wife and I sit with him and try to get him to wave his hand and say ""hello"" or ""hi"" or literally anything else, he won't do it. And you can see in his eyes that he's listening to us and taking the information in, but doesn't ever seem to want to imitate it back to us. 

Here's a funny story. Like I said before, he will imitate the lady in the sign language video EVERY TIME she is on the screen. And sometimes when he runs out of snacks, or when his sippy cup is empty, he will clap his finger tips together and say ""more"" as if he wants more. It's like he just does this on his own, kind of randomly, but he always does it at the ""correct times"". But if for example, the other day he was eating crackers and ate them all. He then pointed to the box of crackers on the counter and kind of moaned like he wanted more. I asked him ""What do you want?"" and without hesitation, he pointed to the box and continued to look distressed like he was dying for more crackers. So then I held the box more toward him and said ""Do you want MORE?"" and did the sign language for more, and he wouldn't repeat it back. He doesn't say ""yes"" or ""no"" yet, and when I ask what he wants, he points directly do it, but I don't know why he won't actually say ""more"" when my wife or I tries to get him to say it at the appropriate time. Yet he will do it when watching the lady in the video every single time! Even if he doesn't actually want ""more"" of anything! 

I am worried about speech delay of course, but also autism to some degree. I told myself I'd never be that way, but it seems like everything nowadays is ""a possible sign of autism"" and I've driven myself NUTS googling stuff on the internet. I know I should stop, but I can't and sometimes I'm worried sick about my son. He smiles at mom and me, he is very much a ""momma's boy"" - he cuddles with her when he's sad or tired, but he also goes through cranky fits where he screams bloody murder and flails around like a fish. 

He is a huge ball of energy - when he gets very excited he will flail or flap him arms in excitement. Alas, I have heard this is a ""sign of autism"" and it scares me to death. When he is very hungry and he knows food is coming (he knows it's food time when he strap him into his booster seat), he will flap his arms when he seems mom or me bringing the food over to him. Or for example, last week we were at a water park and it was his first time - he loved being in the little pools and playing in the fountains and waves, but he did spend a lot of time standing in the water and flapping his arms. Again, I always thought this was just a way to express overwhelming excitement, but now I'm reading it's a possible sign of autism and don't know if I should be worried or not.

He responds to his name, but he does get very ""invested"" in activities and will occasionally become too distracted to look. For example he loves to color with coloring books or draw on his magna doodle. He can even draw circles and basic Mickey Mouse shapes if you ask him! And sometimes he gets so excited and invested in his ""coloring"" that when you say his name, he won't look up. But more often than not, if you say his name Sternly, he will look at you. He points to random things when we're out for walks and will look at me to tell him what they are. After I tell him a few times, he will be able to point them out himself. For example, when we walk, I can say, ""Where's the flag?"" and he'll look around and point to someone's flag on their porch. He can identify ""grass"", ""cars"", ""flags"", ""basketball hoops"", ""telephone poles"", ""anthills"", ""trees"", ""birds"", ""cats"", ""doggies"", etc.... but I'm still worried that his reluctance to try and SAY or REPEAT any of these words could be a sign of autism based on what I've read. Like, that autistic children can recognize things or know WHAT things based on their name, but will not actually ""know"" what they are. That's what scares me. But he smiles and giggles and will point to things in his books and look at mom or me to tell him what they are, he runs around like a crazy person but will also cuddle when he's feeling like it. So I don't know.

I'm just worried and as a first time dad with already-high anxiety problems, I'm driving myself nuts by reading too much stuff on the internet, and I'm looking to hopefully hear from other parents who've been in similar situations - am I crazy? Am I worrying too much? Are these normal two-year-old behaviors?

Me: There's a scorpion!!

I didn't even need the blacklight. It crawled from the back of the couch to the top and looked right at me. It got into a stance to sting me (like on Animal Crossing).

My daughter is going to be turning two in a few weeks and OMG I CAN NOT do this parenting shit. Her tantrums have been so bad when you tell her no. My parents spoil her a lot and give in to her. I already got on them recently to stop doing that and let me and her dad parent. So I’ve always believed a child does not need technology to keep quite. I never gave her my phone to be on YouTube. I’m against that but no one respects what I say and continue giving her what she wants. My parents, my sister and my ex all introduced that to her and she would watch her baby songs. Her favorite is Wheel on the Bus. Anyways, just last night she did a complete switch when it comes to bed time. Bed time was never an issue. Bath at 7:30
And we lay down either watching tv or with everything shut off and she falls asleep no later than 8:30pm. We went on vacation this weekend and bedtime Friday was no problem. On Saturday it was HELL. When it came to bed time she was saying “no no no” and screaming non stop asking for “bus” (YouTube) , and kicking for 30 minutes rolling all over. I eventually had to give in because we were staying at a hotel and I didn’t want any complaints because she was screaming non stop so bad. I let her on YouTube to keep her calm for 10 minutes and it was 9pm already. I took it away and turned off the lights and there she went again just screaming non stop . So I decided to put on the baby channel and she calmed down and She didn’t go to sleep until 10!! So now we’re home and we took a bath and at 7:30 we laid down and there she went again screaming /crying so bad and hyperventilating because she was demanding for “bus” . I was not giving in and just kept ignoring her and then I tried reading a book to her and that kept her calm until the book ended then there she went again with the tantrums because she wanted bus. She was basically screaming and crying for almost a hour. Its 9pm and I couldn’t take it anymore and I went to my parents and told them to take her since they spoiled her so much she doesn’t understand the word no . I’m a single mom and it’s sooooo frustrating when she does this. Shes starting to do the tantrums when we’re out in public and I get so embarrassed because I don’t want to get judged.

The problem is he is staying up until like 11:45 and moving wake up earlier and earlier and earlier to like 8am, so he has effectively cut out like 90 minutes of sleep from his 24 hour cycle that I know he needs (went from like 12.5+ total to 11-11.25 total).

Nobody warned us, however, that this leap in development could come with one of those delightful sleep regressions. It’s been absolutely terrible. He used to be a good and consistent sleeper.

But then for holidays we will have more siblings and grandkids there and need to share a room. Should I get a cot like the one she will have at daycare? Will she get out of it and climb the high double bed in the room when she is napping there alone?

I'm not going to write some long  SOB story to try to make you feel bad for my children or myself. I'm not going to act like I'm some great and perfect mother.

Anyway I wasn't going  to get on here and make my story seem so horrible and tell you all my kids problems and health issues and make it seem like my kids are on deaths door. Most of the time the ones telling those stories are scammers, liars, and drug addicts wanting easy cash that's not me, YEAH my children and I need help badly but not going to lie to get pity. But anyway the point of the post is I am 28 years old single mother of four. I have a 9 week old baby boy, a 15 month old son, a 2.5 year old son, and a 8 year old daughter. I work my ass off as a waitress in a local pancake restaurant in my town 6 mornings a week from 5am-1pm and then I work bartending Thursday, Friday, Saturdays, and some Sundays but not alot. I have to work tow jobs to support the four babies completely on my own and still barely am able to cover all the bills and usually have none left over so it's hard but I made my children so its my job to take care of them. I finally get to go to court August 19th to hopefully start getting child support from their sperm donor. **I had to reapply and turn in a new Food Stamp application because I had to go and get me a replacement SS card and for my daughter and missed the deadline by one day waiting on my SS card to come in the mail. So I'm waiting get a letter from them to see what we have to do next.** Like I said I'm not sugar coating anything or posting a sob story I am going to be blunt and honest. I am struggling y'all! I need some food for my children. Well my youngest is on ENFAMIL AR for spit up formula. But my one year old, 2 year old, and 8 year old need food badly. We are down to nothing and I mean NOTHING at all. I have to just woman up and ask for help and I need help with food for the older three, and formula for my baby son, and DIAPERS &amp; WIPES. 
**I have three boys who are all in diapers and it is a nightmare!** I can provide pictures of my fridge, cabinets, or whatever I just need help ASAP. I don't even have anything to cook for supper tonight and diapers are mostly gone. We all struggle and I'm hoping and praying that instead of bashing me and downing me that us mothers and parents stand together and help one another because you never know when it may be yourself that needs the help.  
**In summary please point me in the right direction of help. Places that help, organizations, tips, and prayers, or anything are welcomed right now! 


WOW yeah I may have should have been careful or thought about not having as many kids in past few years as I have BUT it's too late for that I already have my children now and  not giving them away just because times get hard .I'm not a quitter and sure as hell won't ever quit when it comes to my baby..like I said I'm not perfect but I try.

We have a 3 year old only who is pretty easy going. On a brief visit this weekend overlapping on a shelter in place with her cousins 12 and 9. 

In self awareness, I’M getting overwhelmed with how loud and in your face the cousins are with our little girl. We are used to more quiet and space.

For example, she get constipated easily, and 2 adults and 2 kids crowded around her in her potty, one talking really loud. Preschooler is off today whining and crying, once or twice whimpering. That said it is after travel, and a really late night sleeping in her crib with cousins in beds in same room.

How can I handle this better? Advice welcome. Their parents arrive tonight, and I know I’m set to more sensitive to others. Usually it comes up when they are all roughhousing.

Today I’ve tried explaining calming 2-3 times let’s give her space, or there are too many people crowding, so I’m going to step away. My misstep now was saying “I’m getting really frustrated” testily after 2-3 warnings, and perhaps 3-4 requests to let’s be calmer and keep things peaceful (bedtime, naptime, potty, meals.) I apologized ASAP to the older kids for getting upset. 

I’m usually the fun aunt and we played well earlier. I know I should let the kids work it out and usually let them. That said I’m trying to share my experiences and set limits before things spiral out of control. (Tot can handle a lot but she was between upset sessions.) 

Talk to them and share I’m set differently and ask for solutions together? I think their parents allow a lot more noise and roughhousing with siblings.

She says she feels sad to eat the animals so won’t- no one else in the family is vegetarian so it’s not something we have forced her into. 

I’ve increased the amount of fish and quorn/ tofu I serve and she eats huge amounts of fruit and vegetables as well as full fat dairy products. She also has a childs daily multi vitamin and eats regular kid type of snacks with occasional sweets or ice cream.

Doctor pronounced she’s completely healed and she’s measuring tall and lean, but her weight is exactly where it should be in proportion to height.

**WOW I posted in a sub that I usually love because of the caring and outpouring of love and support and get bashed because I HAVE A PITBULL AND SHOULDN'T HAVE ONE AROUND MY KIDS AND HAVING A PITT MAKES ME A BAD MOM***

I am a mother to 5 human kiddos and 3 fur babies. My humans are 13B, 7G, 2B, 2G, &amp; my newest addition is an 11 weeks old baby boy. Then like I said I have an Alaskan Malmute, Cane Corso (Italian mastiff), and a brindle pitbull. My two year old toddler boy had surgery 8 days ago in North Carolina Children's Hospital in Durham NC on his small intestines, stomach, and also had an umbilical hernia repaired. He was born with severe malrotation birth defect where his whole digestive system was completely upside down  in his abdominal cavity and needed to be completely taken out and redone. We came home two days ago from the hospital to finish recovering at home. He has 42 staples from chest down to his lower stomach. Before surgery for four months he was only allowed to drink PediaSure Peptide and tiny bits of water and now that's ALL he can have for the next 12 weeks while his whole digestive tract is healing in it's proper spot. HE CANNOT HAVE ANY SOLIDS AT ALL OR ANY FLUIDS BESIDES THE PRESCRIPTION PEDIASURE PEPTIDE AND TINY AMOUNTS OF WATER TO RINSE MOUTH OUT... Pediatrician said we/he could not risk having a reaction or him vomiting and straining and tearing open his insides or the big incision outside or he could die due to waste escaping into his body and getting a horrible infection. So for 12 weeks the peptide is his ONLY source of nutrition and food.

Okay now, reason I'm posting this is my pitbull dude has severe seperation anxiety and has to be put in his crate anytime there is not an adult at home with him. If left out he will destroy EVERY THING on his path. And I mean everything including the walls and furniture. My newborn had a pediatrician appointment yesterday afternoon at 4:15pm and we were super late because of course my twin boy who had surgery takes a little longer to get him ready and being careful not to hurt him and them my toddler twin girl was so moody. I ran out the house forgetting to put Dude, the pitbull in his crate. I honestly didn't even think about him being out until we returned home to  ALL OF MY TODDLER SON'S PEDIASURE PEPTIDE BOTTLES AND BOXES CHEWED UP INTO SO MANY PIECES ALL OVER MY LIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN FLOOR AND THE LIQUID WAS COVERED THE FLOOR AND FURNITURE. CHOCOLATE AND VANILLA THICK MILK LIKE LIQUID EVERY WHERE. I cannot believe how stupid and I feel like and idiot I am for forgetting to put him in the crate.

PediaSure Peptide is only obtained by PRESCRIPTION ONLY at pharmacies and medical supply companies. It is super expensive when you have to pay it out of pocket. Insurance buys enough every month for the whole month because that's his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. BUT they refused to pay for a replacement for enough just to last rest of the month til it's time for the new prescription to be filled. We get them on the 15th of every month. I have talked to 8 people at our insurance provider and even spoke to as high up boss as I could. They still will not cover it because I'm guessing the price is super expensive.

I called around to all pharmacies and medical supply companies and cheapest place is $48.76 and that's for 9 days worth and 5 bottles a day. I am a newly single mother. I go to court for child support with their father in three weeks because he refused to help or see his kids. I paid all the bills with what I had saved up and got some groceries when he first left because I didn't expect me to screw up and let the dog ruin my child's food source. I screwed up big time and I feel like a horrible mother and I don't have the $50 to buy him more and he HAS to have it ASAP and I mean like within next hour he has to have his drink because that's his only source of nutrition like I said. 

PLEASE PLEASE anyone where or who can I contact that may offer assistance nor can help me buying it? Any public or religious or charities that may help in these times?

Ok this is a bit of a boy specific problem. I’m mum to a 3 year old boy and lately he’s started putting his hand in his nappy and...ahem..adjusting himself.  I know it’s normal for kids to do this so I’m not worried about that, it’s just that it means that his penis is sticking out, and, since he’s not potty trained (we are working on it), it makes his pants wet, as well as the sheets when he does it at night.  I am always conscious not to shame him for it because I know it’s normal, I always phrase it as his “pee pee” needs to point down or it will make his pants wet, but I just don’t know how else to handle it, or all the extra washing I’m having to do.

He doesnt care if we mess up the lines but he will quickly fix it up if we switched cars around or replaced a car with another toy.

He is also speech delayed and going to speech therapy which is helping. 

His eye contact isnt great and neither is his response to his name but he does do it. He also brings things to show us, points, waves, says hello and bye, follows our gesture when we point and has a amazing memory.. Maybe a little too good? 

We have always suspected he has autism since before he was one because of the eye contact and delayed speech but because he is doing so well in other areas were told to give it more time.

What made me lose it the first time was when he hit and scratch his 2month old sister while I was breastfeeding her. The scratch drew blood on her face.

I grew up from the time where spanking was the norm. I don't want to spank my toddler but I was ""thisclose"" to spanking him 2 hours ago. I'm so angry at myself right now. I understand that to teach him self regulation, I need to regulate my emotions and not hit when angry and frustrated. It's just so aggravating. 

In my head, I know that my toddler is going through a lot of adjustment, like this pandemic being cooped up inside for months, having a new sister, and the development they go through at this age. We try to have ""me time"" with him, like he spends time with just him and his dad playing. I spend time with him and me just reading. And family time. Although time with him decreased because we have a baby that also needs a lot of our time and attention. 

On the ground it feels like there's no end with the tantrums.. We keep telling him that we don't hit and hurt in this family every time he's having a tantrum.

About half the time she will pull down her pants and ask to be cleaned up, other times she just 100% ignores it. And being bottomless only helps a little, and I have seen her just pee where she stands and then starts to play in in.

Lately, I’ve been getting ads for “screenfree” audio devices for kids, and then when I go searching online for reviews, I only find sponsored reviews or reviews for similar devices, so I’m looking to see if anyone here has actually owned one of these (or similar). 

FWIW, I recognize that the pricing is high for these devices and content, and I could probably approximate it with my phone and a Bluetooth speaker, library audiobooks, Alexa etc, but it seems like a lot of work to setup and then need to monitor while in use (when my 3yo would invariably want to change it himself, or switch to a different app on my phone if I turned off the locked controls). (Anyway - I guess change my mind if you have a good system that’s easy!! But at this point of quarantine, I am OK spending some money LOL)

So things I’ve seen so far and my initial impressions based on just their copy:

1.	[Timio](https://timio.co/) $129USD: Includes all content up front, in multiple languages which is cool, but no additional content for purchase (yet?). I imagine a couple discs would be fun (stories) but the rest are a bit too young for my 3yo (animals). On the plus side, if I set it to Chinese, would my son learn some words in Chinese?? Or French... or Spanish... I am a bit skeptical lol. I also don’t know if I would lose the discs. Probably.
2.	[Yoto Player](https://us.yotoplay.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw1K75BRAEEiwAd41h1ARqETV3Wgr40_K9TTNaYUJXT-aNwxNCMWiHBzLJX0s_UuB57DHOthoCh9gQAvD_BwE) $100USD: a small Bluetooth box player with a card slot. You buy cards individually (priced from $6-12 each, looks like) and slot them in to play. For some reason, the Gruffalo is not available in the US which is almost a deal killer right away LOL! There’s some radio and podcast stuff, and customizing available, but I probably would not make use of those. I can see us losing the cards at our house or getting them lost which is a problem. I guess it depends how sturdy the cards are. I think once you play a card for the first time, the audio gets added to their mobile app so you can play it in the car or whatever, so that seems good. I think battery life is only 3 hours which seems like a downside. There is also a rudimentary screen. 
3.	[Toniebox/Tonies](https://us.tonies.com/password) seems like it will launch in the US this fall, but based on UK pricing, I expect it will be around $80USD. Similar concept to the Yoto Player, but instead of cards, they use little figurines to play. There’s no screen at all and the battery life seems to be better (7hours). The individual figures are pricier at 15GBP (so I would guess $20USD), but you do at least get a little toy (which is allegedly waterproof). I can imagine my son enjoying the toys a lot, but also getting them lost. There’s customizable figurines as well, but I doubt I would do it because I am lazy. 


Based on what I’ve read about these three, I’d say I’m leaning towards the Toniebox for my son, but recognize I would be sinking a fair bit of money into the ecosystem. I guess generally things would suck if any of these went under and you couldn’t get any more content, but I guess that’s the inherent risk of any children’s tech like this. 

Anyways - does anyone have any actual reviews for any of these, or similar, products? Anyone want to pay me money to try all three and actually tell you which one is best? (Low key my annoyance with sponsored reviews, is that they won’t tell you which one is best or compare them... ) Or if you have any easy to use alternatives that don’t involve buying anything and don’t involve me sitting at my desk curating playlists (lol), (like a subscription service / app that has the curating already done) please share!

Since then he hasn’t been a very physically affectionate kid. He likes being picked up and carried around but didn’t like hugs or any kind of snuggly/cuddly behavior. 

He just turned two a couple of months ago and he started preferring to go to bed with me laying next to him so he could stick a leg out until he was touching me with his little feet. It was a little gesture but it was sweet and unique and I cherished it. 

Well over the last few days he’s started exhibiting some new behaviors that have absolutely melted my heart. He will follow me everywhere around the house as I’m doing chores and attempts to help (he thinks he’s helping but in reality he’s usually just making a mess, such as pulling everything out of the dryer while I’m folding clothes or throwing toys into the bathtub when I’m just trying to pee - I leave the door open when I go to the bathroom bc he considers toilet trips a Toddler Team Sport). Every so often he’ll start leaning his back against me wherever I’m sitting or standing and then whip his head around to make sure I’m noticing how cute he is and so I can acknowledge him. Those moments end up in a giggle fest with me showering him with kisses and tickles. 

Last night had to be my favorite moment by far... I was sitting on the ground and he made his way over to me so he could sit in between my legs and lean back against my chest like I was his favorite chair. It may not sound like much but for a kid who is FIERCELY independent, prefers to explore/figure things out on his own, and hasn’t been keen on physical affection it was the absolute sweetest moment. AND he sat still for at least 10 minutes which is the longest I’ve ever seen him sit contently in one spot. The kid is legit always zooming around, it was incredible to have him wrapped up in a snuggle for so long!!!

But wait, it got even better!! My husband was having a really difficult time getting him to calm down and go to sleep at bed time so after listening to him whine for 15 minutes I went into the bedroom to lay next to him - he calmed down really quickly after that and every few seconds he’d roll over to either drape one of his legs over my back or reach out to touch my arm or hand. He was asleep in like 5 minutes once I laid next to him. 

I have depression and I’ve been having a difficult time over the past couple of weeks but the sweet little moments that I have with my son have helped raise my spirits and remind me that I’m needed and loved. I was (and still am) totally ok if he ends up not being a super physically affectionate kid/person because he is who he is and I won’t force him to adhere to any arbitrary standards. If he doesn’t like hugs then he shouldn’t be forced to hug anybody.

It's become emotionally and physically draining; we're arguing with each other most days. I believe she can see on our face that we're not happy when we're caring for her, like I""m sure I look exhausted after being kicked throughout a diaper change and struggle to smile back at her when she eventually settles down. We need to make changes but aren't sure what. My husband thinks she's too young for us to do anything other than appease, distract, and indulge, but frankly I'm tired of feeling like a performing clown continually distracting her. I want my dignity back and want to stop feeling defeated.

Problem 1 - Food. We are trying ""we decide what; she decides how much"", I follow all the IGs, have a meal plan, offer a safe choice each meal, add spinach to pasta sauce etc. She just unpredictably rejects food. ""no no no"". She might eat a bit, but throws food and her cups. it's rare to have her start eating without issues. We talk to her reasonably and pick up her cup, and tell her not to throw food, but nothing's improved. She asks for milk at random times of the day so we give her about 4 oz at a time but she doesn't ask for food otherwise. She watches me cook and is interested, just will not put it in her mouth, or will spit it out. Sometimes we try to ""trick"" her by getting a bit onto her tongue so she'll want more. Or we try to bargain with her, like if we offer X and she's not eating, we say ""do you want Y? Z?"". She is growing but she's pretty small and she's always happier after eating, I do think the other problems would be improved if she had a full belly. What do we do? 

Problem 2 - Hygiene. She bucks and kicks during diaper changes, has tantrums getting dressed, won't let me comb her hair, trim her fingernails, etc. The only way to get these done is to distract or overpower. Even my husband is having a hard time with the kicking now. She's getting too strong. She's walking around with food in her hair, and I had to eventually cut knots out. 

Problem 3 - We have great time going for walks, but as soon as we turnaround to come home, she starts being playfully uncooperative (smiling while running away, etc.), and eventually goes to a total meltdown. I've tried turning around earlier, later, etc., no improvements. She turns into a limp noodle, screams, cries. We have a super long stairway to our house, and she bucks so wildly I've come close to slipping. The only way I feel safe carrying her is in a fireman's hold over my shoulder with her screaming the whole way up. I don't see other kids behaving this way, My husband says we should just stay in our backyard.... Is he right? 

The common theme during these tantrums is that her crying is ... theatrical. She'll turn on a dime and become cooperative with the right distraction. She'll be mid-scream, and if I talk to her like an adult, she'll stop and listen, seem reasonable, and at the end go back to her wailing. I will offer to hold her, hold up my arms etc but she just looks away, doubles down and screams even harder. Is she testing us? Trying to understand her boundaries? I do feel we are clearly doormats, wheedling and begging her to do things. But do we really need to ""punish""? How?

I call him by his name and he comes running over. He has an appointment with a speech therapist next month and we will work with them. But I’m wondering what else can I do?

So here is the backstory:

Toddler (2.5) was sleep trained, everything was going great. She is potty trained during the day but wears a nappy at night. Most of the time she is dry overnight too. 

We have a baby on the way, will be here in less than 4 weeks (September 1st latest). 


Now here's the problem:

About a month ago she just stopped going to sleep at night. 
We've tried sleep training her again but she just screams and screams at the baby gate until either she's sick, or we give in. 
At the moment we have to at the very least, be in the room with her. Worse case scenario (most nights right now) we have to be in her bed with her until she falls asleep. 

While this is annoying, it's not terrible. 

The worst thing is once she is actually asleep, she wakes up constantly. Almost every hour, every night, all night. And she won't go back to sleep unless we are in her bed again. And if we try to leave before she's fully asleep she goes mad and we have to start again. 

It's driving OH and me absolutely mad. 


I have enough trouble getting to sleep as it is as I have pregnancy insomnia and severe SPD. OH needs to have a CPAP on at night so shouldn't be going into her room in the first place. 


She will always get up at 430am and doesn't go back to sleep. I do have a rule though that she can't leave the room until her grow clock comes on at 6. That does mean that I end up trying to doze in her bed while she either just sits there or keeps poking me until the sun comes up. 


She still has one nap during the day that she is absolutely not ready to drop.


Due to my SPD I'm unable to take her out during the day. I rely on crutches to get around and walking more than a few minutes is extremely painful and often means I can't walk at all the next day if I try to push through. 


We are sleep deprived and starting to spend days just being angry as we all need to sleep. 


This has turned out quite long. Sorry everyone.

While we were gone for maybe two hours at the MOST, Dude our pittie, managed to make it out alone because I was in such a hurry to get my toddler to his pediatrician appointment and we were running late. Well he completely DESTROYED EVERY SINGLE BOTTLE OF PEDIASURE PEPTIDE THAT MY TODDLER HAS TO SURVIVE OFF RIGHT NOW DUE TO MAJOR GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY HE HAD LAST FRIDAY. My son CANNOT eat ANY solids OR any liquids except the PediaSure Peptide and small amounts of water for the next five weeks if his incision inside his small intestines is healed he will be able to add soft foods in then but that's five weeks away. 

We had the PediaSure Peptide in the cardboard box they came in the mail with from the insurance company sitting in the floor with the bottles we didn't have room for on our shelf beside the box. We had 21 bottles on second shelf from the floor up and 17 on the box on floor. Dude, which by the way, is our dog's name, must have smelled the vanilla and chocolate flavors or something and he started chewing on the bottles and destroyed them all...all the chewed and mauled bottles were all over kitchen and living room and vanilla and chocolate PediaSure EVERYWHERE. All over the hardwood floor and the rugs we have for kids to play on instead of floor. If you google peptide by Pediasure you will see why I am crying and upset and not sure what the heck to do. They are NOT the regular Pediasure you can buy at Wal-Mart or every where these are only bought at pharmacies and medical supply companies. Insurance covers three boxes a month and those are the ones the dog destroyed.  I CALLED INSURANCE COMPANY TO HAVE THEM ALLOW US TO GET REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MY SON HAS TO HAVE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S LITTERLY ALL HE CAN HAVE TO EAT OR DRINK AND HIS ONLY MEANS OF SURVIVAL. THEY DENIED THE REPLACEMENT AFTER ME TALKING TO 7 DIFFERENT PEOPLE. They denied my son getting more because they said we shouldn't have a dog..I'm serious that's what the big man in charge of the insurance company to me on the phone. I swear he told me that. Well...
I called all the pharmacies and supply companies around us and one of the local pharmacies is willing to let us get just enough for rest of month for a pro-rated price since it's not a months worth prescription. Usually out of pocket pay for one WHOLE month is $786.55 but the pharmacy called pediatrician and he wrote a prescription for just enough til we can get the whole prescription when the 14th of August comes with insurance. So the PediaSure Peptide out of pocket cost at cheapest place is $48.99. I honestly cannot afford even $5 right now due to im raising a 3 month old, 2 year old, 6 years old, and 9 year old alone completely on a daycare worker salary. I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. I feel so stupid for being in a rush and forgetting to put our dog in his kennel and it's my fault he ruined my son's only means of nutrition. I know I am going to get a lot of hateful comments on how I am a bad mom but honestly I did not mean to at all. 

My question is how or who can I contact or visit to get help to buy the Peptide like ASAP really need it now or at least before breakfast when my toddler wakes up starving. I've cried, prayed, and racked my brain trying to find help and ideas. I need to figure this out ASAP..please tell me if anyone knows where I can get help or ideas.

I was hoping to get some advice on my 19-month old toddler and eating habits/routines. Mealtime is always a crapshoot for us in terms of getting him to eat. If we get him to sit in his high chair and eat a full meal once a day, that’s a very good day. Typically, putting him in the high chair is a non starter, as he starts to scream and wriggle and just wants to run around. This usually results in us chasing him around with food, and there is a 50/50 chance he will eat what we give him. We’ve done the “wait it out” approach and will try putting him in the high chair again in 15-30 minutes and that works sometimes, but usually not. Our nanny has a little more luck than us, but not always. He’s also pretty picky with food he eats, which makes this even more difficult. He’s a very active and energetic little boy, so this is all very much in line with his personality, but we feel he should be sitting down for mealtimes. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and have any tips for getting kids accustomed to eating in a high chair? It makes it difficult to teach him how to spoon feed himself and we worry it’s also building bad habits (not to mention a choking hazard when he’s constantly running around with food).

I've spent the past 3 months getting a house livable (that we will eventually move into). It has been a huge learning experience for myself. An unexpected load I have had to carry. This is not my excuse but the only real reason I can find as to why I have dropped the ball.

Or why didn't I figure things out earlier?

He is my first so these things are huge learning experiences for me too.

She’s doing great! Learning how to zoom along, balance, and coast for a few seconds at a time. 

She’s working on keeping her head pointed forward as she rides as every time she turns her head to talk to us, she pulls the handlebars to the same side and proceeds to fall or nearly fall. Overall, she’s doing fine and getting right back up when she falls. 

Anyway, a bit later, we’re standing still waiting for another dog to pass. Our dog just can’t handle another dog coming so close (30 feet) and is tugging at Mom. My daughter, standing still on her bike, turns her head to see what’s going on, the handlebars turn, and she loses her balance and falls. She gets a little bloody knee. Little is an overstatement. She cries. We give her a hug, tell her it’s going to be ok, and we’ll get that bandaid she so desperately requests as soon as we get home. Yada, yada. 

For the next 7 minutes, she cries only in between having a blast chasing Mom or Dad on her bike. She gets tuckered out, cries some more, and doesn’t want to ride her bike anymore. 

So she hops on the front of the stroller where Sister is riding. Sister proceeds to use her feet to push off an already fussy 3.5 year old. Sister wants the stroller to herself. We convince Daughter to just walk as we’re almost home. She walks and cries because her bloody knee is hurting.

We walk about a half a block and she’s having a blast again talking about making a cake. She cries. Her knee hurts. Then talks about chocolate chips. 

Then she trips on a driveway!

She sits up, gestures grandly at her other knee, and whines, “Oh no, not again!” 

It’s obvious she’s not really hurt (not even bleeding) and Mom and Dad have to hold in laughs at her realization of her “not again” bad luck!

She “cries” and wants her band-aid for the first knee. I ask if she wants to ride on my shoulders. She gives an emphatic “yes!” and we laugh the rest of the way home. 

We get home, put on a bandaid, get in the bath. She fusses that she can’t bend her knee and it’s bloody. 

We remove the bandaid. She looks at her knee, sees no blood, and says, “It’s gone!”

How do you keep yourself from comparing your child and their milestones, skills, “academics” (using loosely obviously, but like early counting and phonics and stuff) etc., to those of their peers?

Or, perhaps different but more useful, what do you do/say to yourself when you recognize yourself comparing your kid to someone else’s?

Example: my two year old has a huge vocabulary but about 99.99% of it is said wrong. His own name sounds completely wrong (like, none of the same sounds). Really mundane words like milk (mote) or that (dada) or truck (gratz). Meanwhile his cousin, who is two months younger, speaks long phrases with really clear articulation. This is one of several ways they are super different, both in personality and in milestones. They’re here visiting and while I love my son and have no difficulty seeing the areas where he excels (even beyond his cousin’s), I don’t want the cure to my comparison issue to become “find ways he’s outshining them” since that’s not any better.

Now that I just had another baby, I want to figure out how to minimize this habit before it becomes destructive...especially because I don’t want either of my boys to feel I’m comparing THEM to each other. I don’t verbalize any of my comparisons or anything, but I know it‘s not helpful and could be hurtful, so better to put a stop to it.

I hope this is allowed but if not, admins please feel free to delete.

My mom just got laid off from her Montessori teaching job where she worked for 15 years as a lead toddler teacher. She refused to go back to work mainly because she's high risk. After a few months of wondering, her fear came true and now she is jobless.

Since my mom is amazing with kids and her gift of assessing children's learning is remarkable, I had a eureka moment where I created an online course for her to help parents with their kids while there is a stay at home ordinance and schools are closed. This would hopefully be her retirement gig as I personally do not want her to go back to work anyway.

We've been pretty vigilant about watching for allergies to pop up. 

For the last two months, we've noticed that any time DD ate tomatoes she would wake up screaming in the middle of the night and be upset for the next few days. It started when we went out of town to husband's aunt and uncle's house and she ate spaghetti the first night we were there. DD cried all night and was very upset the whole weekend. We noticed the night screaming and a splotchy rash on her face and chest after eating salad with Catalina dressing. At first we thought it was just stains from the dressing, but it didn't wash off in the tub and the night waking continued. She also started getting a terrible diaper rash and was constipated. We decided to cut tomatoes out of her diet and see what happens. It seems to have helped for the most part, but she was still having some of the night waking and the diaper rash. We started looking into tomato allergies and found that it could be all nightshades, including potatoes and some spices as well as the tomatoes. We cut the spices and have started cutting out potatoes.

It seems that all of our greatest children stories seem to follow this pattern of threes, so when his age and his magical number became the same we had quite a excited and emphatic child on our hands. 

But 3 isn’t just important for nursery rhymes and magical stories, it’s also a milestone of change and adjustment. Trust me, I didn’t understand this either...

I used to believe you parented all toddlers the same up until age 4 when they graduate the toddler stage and enter... whatever you call it... young adulthood? But trust me. The magic number is 3, not 4. 

Although your child is still a toddler he is developing differently and on completely different wavelengths at age 3 than his prior days. So we must do what parents do best- adjust to our children’s hectic brains. 

I wrote a book on adjusting to these changes called Tic Tac Toddler. If you are interested in it, please email me at

BEFORE AGE 3: LIMIT SETTING


You’re child is developing what psychologists call his sensory brain. Although his brain is developing, don’t expect him to be Einstein. Your child is simply gaining sensory and motor function, meaning he is learning to use his muscles and gaining the foundations of physical maturity. 

While he’s gaining physical maturity, don’t expect any intellectual maturity of any sort. 

So how do we deal with this? If your child isn’t smart enough to recognize what he did wrong, then how do we punish them?

Ready for the kicker?... YOU DON’T. 

Using this psychologically proven method, you will actually be LIMITING THE SETTING, not DISCIPLINING

In limiting the setting you will be keeping the child safe from their surroundings due to the fact that they physically can’t know what will harm them and what won’t, You will be repeating basic rules like a broken record, and you will be essentially thinking for your child as they don’t have the capacity to do so for themselves. 

Remember the sensory brain? They are simply gaining motor function and gaining awareness of their surroundings. They will throw forks at a running toaster to see what sound it makes!

This means there is no point in disciplining a child if they don’t have the ability to monitor their actions and stop themselves the next time. 


AFTER AGE 3: DISCIPLINE


Congratulations! You’ve made it through the exhausting Limiting the Setting time period, now it’s time for us to one again adjust with our child’s development. 

So here’s what’s going on with your child. Their sensory brain is pretty much developed, meaning they have basic motor functions and are able to walk around due to their physical maturity. 

Now their brain is starting to focus on developing it’s intellectual side, meaning they will begin to monitor their behavior and control impulses using judgment. All you have to do is build that good judgment for them through discipline. 

Create a time out chair, take away their favorite toy, or leave the space anytime they act in a way that is deserving of discipline. 

Two things you should keep in mind when disciplining:

1. Stay consistent. It’s your toddler’s nature to find the line. They will constantly be pushing you to know what is and isn’t okay. If you aren’t consistent with punishment, then the line isn’t clearly drawn for the child and they will often cross it. 

Example: If you punish them for taking their shirt off in the grocery store, but you’re too busy on a phone call to punish them for taking their shirt off at your dinner table, then they will likely start to undress themselves at the Olive Garden. 


2. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT use physical force and or aggression to punish your kids. Now, a lot of people have mixed feelings about this, so let me give you both sides of the equation. 

If you use a wooden spoon to spank your child every time they do something wrong, congratulations! They will do their best to prevent that wooden spoon at all costs and you will get your point across faster. 

BUT- you will he getting that point across through fear, meaning the only thing keeping your child from crossing the line is the fear you have put in place. Creating fear instead of love and compassion is never the answer (in my opinion) because that fear won’t go away too easily. It often blossoms and grows with the child throughout their young adult years and creates an unhealthy relationship with your child most of the time permanently. 

I know it’s hard to believe that something you do when they are so young creates foundations of believes and fears as they grow to be adults but believe me, it’s true. 

Now. I don’t expect you to follow everything I have discussed in this post. Some people believe in different things and I totally understand. What I have written are simply proven psychological facts that have worked for me and my family.

I packed her dinner so we could take a break and eat and arrive home a little past 7 with a full belly, tired body, ready for milk and Sesame Street and books before bed.

Best laid plans, friends.

She was a terror. 

She's scarily adept at climbing out the side of the pool. She kept climbing out and running alongside the pool from one end to the other. I always say ""walking feet"" or ""walk"". It wasn't working tonight so I climb out to talk to her up close, on her level. Keeps running and thinks it's funny. Then she kept throwing the traffic cone that was on the patio area into the pool. I don't get out every time she exits the pool because she usually just jumps right in but this time she just kept taking off. So here I am, walk-jogging in a bathing suit, mom bod in all its glory, realizing I probably should have shaved, trying not to yell at my not-listening terror toddler. The icing on this shit cake was when she runs over to another family's assigned picnic table (covid precaution) and touches their stuff.

I catch up to her, pick her up, tell her she's not being safe and not using walking feet so we have to go. I carry her out while she's yelling ""no"".

Today (after a nap) he wanted them straight and for them to stand and got very upset when he couldn't do it by himself. After a couple of times showing him how, I left him to it and started some dishes. He threw a full on tantrum after he couldn't do it successfully (not funny, not cute). I stopped what I was doing to help him but that wasn't enough. I tried to get him to verbalize what he wanted (he talks a lot, in full sentences, so normally he would do this) but all I got was screaming and crying. Then I tried to pick him up to console him and he was pushing himself out of my arms, throwing himself, the whole nine. I handed him the figures so he could show me what he wanted and he knocked then out of my hand and/or threw them across the room. I tried to change the subject, wasn't having it. So I put him in his crib because I figure if he's going to throw himself it might as well be somewhere soft and safe.
The whole ordeal lasted AN HOUR and he was all red and clammy and breathing like a crazy person. Like he really just went through it.
...Needless to say we took away the figures when he wasn't looking.

He has NEVER done anything like this and like I said in the beginning he's normally very calm and very go with the flow, very much unlike his wild 4yo brother. This put my wild hyper 4yo to shame.

Hey guys! Maybe someone can help me or give advice on this situation. 

My husband works all day and isn’t home for dinners except on his weekends. That means I’m left making a meal for just myself and my picky 2 year old for the whole week. I am not a skilled cook and have mostly just made easy or quick microwaveable meals or sandwiches for myself and my husband up until our son started solids. We both never ate vegetables either but have been trying to overcome our own pickiness to set an example with our kid. I’ve been trying extremely hard to get a variety of vegetables, meats, and home cooked meals into our life but it hasn’t been that successful with our son and it’s very frustrating and makes me feel unmotivated to cook when I’m making an entire meal with sides that only I am eating. 

My son is picky. He seems to have an aversion to certain textures or “chewy” foods. He will not eat bread or any bread-like textures (so no sandwiches, toast, tortillas, pancakes, cookies,...) and immediately spits it out. He won’t eat his vegetables or certain meats and just pockets them in his mouth. I have tried different sauces and firmness (mushy or crunchy veggies). He will put them in his mouth, but for most of the things, he just pockets them for hours or until I tell him to spit it out. I’ve tried different meats as well and 9 times out of 10, it gets pocketed regardless of how tender it is. 

He also tries to shove a bunch of food in his mouth at once which also might contribute to the pocketing, but I’ve combated it with taking his plate away between bites and cutting pieces into extremely tiny manageable sizes. But he still pockets even the tiniest of pieces of food. 

He WILL eat cheese, Cheerios, crackers, pasta (spaghetti or macaroni), scrambled eggs, sausage, fish sticks, and chicken nuggets just fine. But I can’t seem to get much of a variety other than that. 

Any advice from someone who maybe went through a similar situation with their kiddo?

Moving to a new state and as usual I’m overthinking how the transition will be. My toddler has this huge (handmedown) Barbie dream house that she kind of likes but it’s becoming more of an art piece than toy. We are moving in a couple weeks and it’s not coming to the new house. She will get a new smaller one to replace it and we will work through it if she really goes nuts (she’s a sensitive kid sometimes). I have someone interested in it now and kiddo is gone for the day tomorrow while I pack. My worry is she comes home to no dollhouse and then it’s a month of asking where it’s gone and lots of impatience and anxiety until she gets the new one. Again she barely uses this thing but it’s got a  big presence in her room and she is protective of the dolls inside (who have been napping in their beds since we got the house 6 weeks ago).

It shows when your child typically goes pee/poo, so you can have an idea of when to prompt, and you can chart their progress over time.

-When he wants to play in other kids vehicles at the park, he will fuss and wriggle intensely when I remove him and run right back. This is the only situation in which he will tantrum but it’s bad. 

-he displays plenty of joint attention and joint play on his own time but if he is distracted playing on his own or intent on doing something bad he will often have no reaction to his name being called. 

-at his first gym class he warmed up to one giant ball and wanted to push it around for most of the class. He would not sit in my lap in the circle but would circle back and clap if he saw people clapping or dance (situational awareness but not listening). They told me this was a pretty typical reaction for first class but I’m not sure how long I should “normalize” his behavior. 

-he is speech delayed but the few words he does have are communicative and often go with gestures (here, this, that). Newer words are hi, mama, dada. He doesn’t really show an interest in repeating or labeling but will repeat/mimic actions (cleaning up, phone to ear “hi”, waving, dancing).

If one of us goes to sleep with her she will generally fall asleep (but sometimes even then it takes forever), but we've been trying to get her to start going to sleep on her own and it is not going well. She will fight for HOURS some nights. She also wakes up most nights and wanders into our room. I generally don't mind that, because she's barely awake when she does it and falls asleep pretty much instantly. It's the drawn out refusing to go to sleep part that is starting to get super old. She's hopefully starting kindergarten next year, and we really really need to have her sleeping better by then!

We always read several stories and brush teeth before bed, but could probably work on more of a routine. 

Daycare makes her take a nap (she hasn't napped for me good like at least a year and a half, but they have to do it for her class and after a LOT a fighting she will nap for them usually). I think she might sleep better at night when she doesn't have to do this (starting next month probably), but she's also difficult on the days she doesn't go to daycare.

We've tried letting her listen to relaxing music or audiobooks. We generally go on a walk after dinner to try to get her wiggles out. We changed her light out for a ceiling fan so we can pull the cord and she can't turn the light back on herself. We've tried telling her she can play quietly until she feels tired (she will do that sometimes but eventually gets bored and wants to come out). She has a night light (but isn't really afraid of the dark) that she can turn on or off. We have tried just letting her have a tantrum and tire herself out, but she JUST KEEPS GOING, and her room is next to the baby's room and she's caused him to wake up several times (plus we also can't sleep!!).

It is me, my boyfriend, his parents, and his five year old nephew. My boyfriends sister, his nephews mother, is a drug addict who disappeared for a while leaving her child with her parents. My boyfriends parents gained custody of him, but are still very much in the “grandparent stage” such as no discipline, they do everything for him, and he receives everything he asks for. He has the speech of a 2-3 year old. He uses very minimal words to create sentences and does not properly use words. For instance, he says “me hungry”, “me thirsty”, or “I need potty”. Me and my boyfriend are constantly fighting about his nephew because I want to help him, but my boyfriend will not stand up to his mother or sister. My boyfriend has dealt with this since his nephew was born and knows no one is going to change anything so he has sadly given up. He always tells me how bad he feels for the child, but there’s not much that he can do. His nephew will be starting school soon and does not know his ABC’s, how to count, or even his name, he only knows his nickname. He has very poor manners and demands you to do things for him because that’s what my boyfriends parents do. If he wants a drink he tells me to get him a drink instead of asking. I have tried to teach him manners, but it doesn’t do much help when no one else is on board to help. My boyfriends sister, the child’s mom, has recently stepped back into the picture and anytime I try to sit down and teach him stuff she takes him away from me saying he doesn’t need to know those things. I don’t know what to do anymore and I can’t stop thinking about the poor child in this situation. He also does not have a bedtime which is crazy to me. He stays up until 3-4 in the morning and then wakes up at 2 in the afternoon. If he is woken up before he is “ready to get up” then he becomes cranky and irritable, but they expect him to be able to wake up for school with no problems in the next few weeks with no changes. I have asked them to give him an earlier bedtime, but they haven’t even bothered to try. Can someone please help me or give me advice on what I can do?? I’m really struggling here.

Nonetheless, as the title suggests, my 2yo is terrified of the act of pooing. It's been going on for a few months now. She holds it in for 4+ days until it forces itself out. She has spurts of running around the house screaming 'poo' like it's going to come up but even then it can be a couple of days before it eventually comes out. When it does come out it's very traumatic for all of us and she screams in tears. I definitely think it's phycological as a result being painfully constipated on a couple of occasions, but I don't believe constipation is the current cause. We have been giving her a poos softener and she eats healthy. 
I have spoken to the Dr and he couldn't recommend much but fortunately her holding in he poos won't cause her any long term damage. Still, it's stressful to see her go through this. It's getting to the point where this issue is affecting our lives too. We can no longer go to restaurants because the last 2 times she started screaming 'poo' and eventually pooed at the restaurant. People look and stare at us. On one occasion I had to sit with her in the car and miss out on dinner.  She also now hates bath time. Because the bath relaxes her, she has pooed in the bath a few times so now she refuses to have a bath and I now have to wash her standing up. 
I'm really at a loss what I can do to reassure her. She doesn't seem old enough to understand when I tell her it's ok to poo.

They reopened in a very limited capacity this summer and have had good results (i.e., no infections), but they were operating on campus by themselves and without the presence of the elementary-aged children who normally attend the same school during the regular academic year. It sounds like they’ve gone above and beyond the recommended safety measures, even going so far as to limit class sizes to only two children per “pod”.  

We’re leaning toward sending him back for a number of reasons, although we have a **number** of reservations. However, our decision is complicated by (among many things) our newborn, who will be less than two months old by the time daycare starts up again at the end of August.

We have a pretty happy home life. My only (2.5) daughter is an extremely shy girl but so much fun. We moved back to our home state before the pandemic. She is having a hard time getting used to family and has really only warmed up to one grandparent. The pandemic set us back even more than where we were at getting her used to family.

I do my best to find good solutions to handle her shyness but this new development has me a little stumped and since she just started doing it I wanted to ask so I can respond appropriately. 

When we visit a family member after a little while she will state she will want to go home. I respond by telling her that I hear her but I am going to visit with family member a little longer. She will continue stating she wants to go home again and again getting more and more upset. It’s hard to want to stay when I have her constantly saying this.

I'm a play therapist by training.  

1. Try to form a pod with a family you really can trust, who has a child the same age, if at all possible.  This will be priceless.  You can have a long conversation about the ""rules"" of your pod first.  But for your child to have one playmate is invaluable.  If you can't do this, there's a lot of things you can do!  
2. Have a dedicated playtime where you give feedback to your child like a ""normal"" child would.  You play with your child not like a mom, but rather like another toddler.  You tell them what you want to do; don't let them dictate everything.  Does that make sense?  You can call this your ""special"" playtime.  You focus on them completely, and use your imagination to play.  Even if it's just 15 minutes a day.  This will help them to have a playmate experience, even if they don't have one right now!  I also do a lot of special playtime during which I do whatever she wants, but I just think there needs to be balance.  When children only play with their parents, they rarely get the kind of feedback that comes from other children--""Like NOOO you can't play with that, I'm playing with that.""  ETC.  It might be confusing for littles so I would say, ""I'm going to pretend to be a little kid like you right now!"" 
3. Use a variety of toys so that your toddler can start telling you stories and using their imagination.  This varies widely by age, but my 3-year-old is already super into imaginative play.  Even 2 year olds though can start using stuffed animals to tell stories.  Stories are how you can help your child to learn empathy.  ""The doggy is hurt.  He's sad."" ETC.  I recommend reading ""Play Therapy"" by Garry Landreth and ""How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.""  It's never too early to start using a lot of empathy when you talk to your child.  Empathy is the foundation of great social-emotional skills.  I included a picture of all of the figures I use during special playtime (obviously these are for kids who don't put everything in their mouths).  I don't let her play with these alone, but only with me.  I have figures that are happy, sad, angry, scary, animals, people, etc.  Just a wide variety.  
4. Consider starting to use a time-in corner (Generation Mindful makes one, but you can also make one yourself).  See pic.  This is to help teach self-soothing and self-calming skills.  Critical in life : ) Make it as simple as possible for the little ones.  ""You are so upset right now.  What can you do to help yourself calm down?  You can hug your elephant.""  
5. REFLECTING FEELINGS!  This is the foundation of play therapy, but essentially you are just constantly commenting on how your little one is feeling.  ""I can tell that you're so happy right now!""  ""I know that you're sad.""  ETC.  This builds so much social-emotional awareness.  Reading the books above will help with giving you suggestions for this.  

What else???  GOOD LUCK.  It's so hard to be your child's primary caregiver right now!!!  It's okay to put on the TV.  I really LOVE the show Daniel Tiger.  If you use the skills Daniel Tiger teaches, your child will have a ton of social-emotional intelligence.  We sing the songs all the time in our home to get her to do things she doesn't want to do.  Can't recommend it enough.

I usually have to walk away from her for my sanity but then she's still sleepy and tired so the whole thing repeats again for hours. Meanwhile colleagues are pinging me, so it gets really stressful. I'm in tears everyday and she's only fighting harder.

For now, I'm trying to think of ways we can start working on things with him ourselves. He often seems not very aware of his body or things in the area.

His mom is this amazingly kind person who goes out of her way to do favors for the caretaker and the kids. She teaches them special lessons and does crafts with them ahead of holidays. It makes it so much harder to criticize her kid.

I told her that I agree with that theory in general, but it seemed over the top advice for a three year old. Then I admitted to her that the other kid is the primary reason we’re looking for a new daycare.

Another issue is that my brother and his wife just moved in to my parents house and they have a puppy who is much bigger than Mazzie and they don't get along because Mazzie is older and doesn't want to play since she sees the puppy's ""play"" as ""I'm attacking you""

So Mazzies anxiety is higher right now because of the puppy so her patience with my daughter is a lot shorter than it has been in the past.

We've been telling her to ""be nice"" to the dogs and pet them softly since she was first sitting up by herself and could interact with the dogs.

For my doctoral research, I am exploring the role of sport and exercise in fathers’ postnatal wellbeing and mental health. I am interested in this area because of the lack of research into fathers’ experiences as well as the few support services available for fathers.

I am inviting people to share their experiences through an online interview or survey. If you are a father with a child aged between one and five, who participates in any form of sport or exercise, I would be interested in your experiences.

The online interviews are conducted via Skype or a telephone call, and should last no longer than forty-five minutes. If you are interested in sharing your experiences this way, please email me at: samantha2.holley@live.uwe.ac.uk for further information and to arrange a time convenient for you.

First time posting here. My son is 3 in August and has had a diagnosis of Autism, global delay, and SPD since he turned 2.

He's not chill if we are in the backyard though, he wants to be out going on walks all day long and it's exhausting. Sometimes I just want to hang out at home, but it's just not peaceful here when he's home. I want to go back to school for nursing and I am so anxious about it since he's so clingy (I won't do anything until he's back in daycare). 

Anyway, I'm posting here to ask what you guys recommend for sensory activities at home that maybe I haven't thought of. He's constantly sensory seeking, always understimulated at home, and I'd love to try to fix that. His occupational therapist has no new/good ideas because he's just not interested in much lol.

My ideas:

1. Seems like any efforts to set up an environment where the kid is least likely to be able to hurt themselves no matter what they get into is very worthwhile. If I could have large stretches of time where I will find it very unlikely for my kid to be able to put something in their mouth that could hurt them or fall off of something or hit their head badly etc, it would be much more low stress.

2. Also I think it's especially hard to keep a kid entertained and happy with the amount of novelty they have when in relative isolation away from friends. I think kids having other kids to look at and play with is a major source of entertainment that many of us are missing out on right now, and having that kind of community is extremely helpful and all efforts should be made to have that available as much as possible during everyday.

3. It would be really ideal to have a group of maybe four parents or so take turns having two of them watch all the kids while the other two get to be off doing their own things.

He hasn't had any accidents since day 3 and is doing really well telling us and his teachers at daycare when he needs to go. We are super lucky on this front.

So what's the problem? Now that he knows pee and poop go in the potty he will not pee in his diaper at night. He wakes up and calls for us to take him to the potty. It is great that he recognizes what his body is doing, but it is getting hard to wake up in the middle of the night to bring him to the potty.  I am have flashbacks to baby life and have even being hearing phantom cries for potty :S He is also waking up 30-60 minutes earlier than he used to because he has to pee and has been a bit crankier in the day, probably because it takes him a while to fall back asleep after peeing.

Any suggestions for helping us all sleep through the night? Is the solution teaching him how to use the bathroom on his own during the night? He is still in a crib because he has not tried to climb out and so far that has made our life easier, but we have a toddler bed we could move him to.

I was majorly stressed out about having to transition my 2.5 year old and 1 year old to sharing a room. All of us have slept great for 6 months and I didn’t want to disrupt it, however we’ve run out of bedrooms with a 3rd on the way. I wanted to make the transition well before baby was here. With as much help as my fellow parents usually are, I didn’t receive great advice about this, nor was it in any of my go to parenting books.  I assumed parents were hiding from me that their kids never slept again after sharing a room, haha. 

Here’s how I did it, given the limited information I could find. 

2 weeks prior: I started talking to my older one repeatedly about sharing a room with her little sister. I asked her if she wanted to sleep with little sister in her room (luckily she said yes), and said not tonight, but next week we will move your bed into your little sister’s room and you’ll sleep in the same room.  She asked a few questions, like sister sleep in my room?  And I’d said no, I’ll move your bed into sisters room and you will sleep there. And we’d point to her little sisters room. I did that a lot, at least once a day. 

DAY OF THE MOVE: The morning of, I explained that when she went to school (daycare), I’d move her bed, and when she came home her bed would be in her sisters room and that night she’d sleep in there. I’m happy she got hyped up for it.  

When she came back from daycare, her face lit up with the change. We all had play time in the new room with the new setup.  I told her repeatedly she’d sleep in there tonight.  I told her the new rules, she will be quiet at night but she can quietly sing and read books, and she’s not allowed to touch the camera or go in her sisters crib. 

When it was bedtime, we did books in the new room in her bed. When I went to leave, the older one had a sad, pouty face, the same one when she transitioned to a big girl bed.  Those break my heart.  I locked the door from the outside (went back and forth on this but settled on locking the door and keep a baby cam in the room) and stared at the cam all night.  The little one was so tired she slept almost immediately.  The older one got up twice to check the door, went back to her bed, and “read” books for 2 hours before she fell asleep.  

DAY 2:  On the first wake up, my younger one cried out an hour before normal wake time and the older one woke too. I was tired but we just started our day.  (I.e. Dad got breakfast ready)

First nap - the girls nap at the same time (so I can nap, too!). They were okay for a while but my husband moved the camera and I didn’t have eyes on them. The little one cried out a little so I checked on them. Bad idea.  It started off a bad chain of events, none of which ended in sleep.  At one point, the older one was in the crib.  Hilarious, but also no one slept. I had to remind her of the rule to not go in the crib. 

NIGHT 2: The girls (and I) were super tired by bedtime. They did books in the new room. I told my oldest one if my younger one cried out at all, just to roll over and go to sleep. The younger one did cry a little and eventually fell asleep, and the older one just rolled around and played with her books quietly for a couple hours before going to sleep. 

DAY 3: The girls woke up after 12 hours well rested.  Learning from nap time yesterday, I took them out in the sun so they could climb and run and be extra tired. We had a big heavy lunch. I’m currently at nap time where both of them chatted for a bit and then eventually fell asleep for 2 hours.  I started referring to their room as both of their rooms now, and prepped my older one that we will say thank you and goodbye to her old room today. After their snack, I’ll have my older one help me switch the lock to the inside, we’ll all go in as a family, and formally say goodbye to the room, and lock it for the next few weeks.  

Eventually, I’ll get the new babies crib and he’ll move in there. Toddler memory is scary good but hopefully she’ll have removed the “this is my room” feeling so we can reintroduce it as babies room. 

I’m pretty excited about this seeing as we move a lot. We were getting 3 bedroom Airbnb’s so the girls could have their own room because who wants to go on vacation and not sleep???  This will mean less housing that we will need in the future. It will make hotels a heck of a lot easier.  And most importantly, since there’s so little stability in our lives, I hope them sleeping together at night gives them a little more stability with each move. Especially as they get older and can talk to each other.  Once baby 3 sleeps through the night, I’m thinking of all of them sharing a room!  

Anyway, it’s another milestone passed, relatively easily. Also, as an introvert, I have really had to find my words to explain things as nauseam.

My son is 1 1/2 

I’ve noticed something that I thought was inappropriate and weird behavior displayed by my sons grandma (husbands mom). 

Last weekend, they stayed the weekend with us and went to the pool. Upon coming back, grandma went upstairs to change out of her swimsuit and proceeded to take my child with her. Mind you, my husband, FIL, and I were all standing there when she goes to take him. 

Today, they come to visit for the day and we were about to leave our house to grab lunch. She has to use the bathroom and takes my toddler into the bathroom with her. 5 other adults, including both parents are all in the room when she takes him. No one but me, bats an eye. I turn to my husband and express my discomfort and he sort of brushes me off. 

Que to later and they’re leaving to drive back to their city and grandma needs to use the bathroom before the car ride... again, takes my child into the bathroom with her. 6 of us are sitting in the living room as this happens. My husband finally speaks up and tells her not to, but she is halfway across the next room and claims to not have heard him. Comes out and he tells her she should not be taking our son into the bathroom with her. 

Someone please tell me I’m not the only one who finds this odd. Why take him to the bathroom or with you to change if you’re not the parent and there is someone or multiples someone’s able to immediately keep an eye on him? Do any other grandparents do this or anything like it? 

I will say that I do NOT think this is sexual grooming. If anything, I think it’s maybe something else? Control? Another type of grooming, if anything. I’m not even sure what to make of this, but it certainly feels uncomfortable.

My son just turned 15 months, hit all milestones before 12mo and is such a loving and playful toddler. I’ve been noticing some concerning signs in which I listed below, starting around 12-15 months. We also recently brought a new baby home and it seems to have affected my son negatively. 
ASD does not run in our family, however, I was told that I did not talk until 2y and grew up socially awkward and preferred to play alone. I am a thriving health care provider now...
Anyways, below are the observed signs:

Concerning signs of possible ASD according to CDC guidelines:
-Has not responded to his name, but turns and looks at Alexa enabled devices when saying “Alexa” (~12mo)
-Avoids eye contact when up close, or trying to get his attention (~12mo)
-Flips toy cars over and spins wheels sometimes (~13-14mo)
-Hand flapping when running/happy (~12-13mo)
-Looks at ceiling/lights and smiling sometimes (~13-14mo)
-Occasionally will shake head side to side (~13-14mo) *Dont know if he is trying to say no or random* 
-Peripheral side glancing/looking up and blinking eyes (~14-15mo)
-Finger posturing (index only) touching holes, tags, and sometimes will stick out follow his finger/spin in circles (~14-15mo)
-Likes to open/close doors, stand behind closets, open/close cabinets rapidly (~13-15Mo)
-Says mama/dada and babbled a lot from 12-14 months but recently stopped around 14-15Mo.

Other concerning signs:
-Does not point to what he wants, brings toys to parents to show, or imaginary play (using cellphone) 
-Seems to look into the distance at times (being in his own world) (~15Mo)
-Does not feed self, wave bye/hello, or hi-five
-Doesn’t like to be pushed around outside in stroller or toy vehicle anymore (~14-15Mo)

Normal developmental signs that contradicts ASD:
-Likes to be around people and family, ok with crowds like at the beach 
-No observable sensory issues (does not cover ears with loud noises) 
-Runs to mommy/daddy with eye contact and smiles
-Smiles a lot and laughs when playing, likes to play ball
-Follows our finger when we point to pictures on the wall
-Not picky, eats everything he is fed
-Falls asleep by himself with a pacifier and stuff animal, sleep well throughout the night but tosses and turns and rarely wakes up crying
-Occasionally listens to directions like “No” or “Throw it” or “Lets go” -Likes to play hide and seek
-Does not line up toys

So I showed these symptoms to his pediatrician and was surprised that he encourage we take action now. Called around and was told there was a 6 month waiting list. Found a reputable PhD psychologist that specializes in ASD diagnosis and for cash pay of $1K, will be evaluating my son next week! Also called Early steps here and they will send someone out for an evaluation too!!!

This is the first daycare my child has been in, this is not a “formal” licensed daycare. The increase initially proposed was $170 increase after a few years at the same rate. Then $120. The reasoning was their personal income (our child funds the extracurriculars so not their main income), and driving our daughter to Daycare 2x a week (it’s about 10 minutes away). While this hasn’t been an issue before - they also stated they couldn’t find another child to fill the income gap (although we know in our current predicament there’s a lot of kids needing care). We said that would be ok if we could write it off (this would end game save us $5k). But they were not comfortable with that and stated if we wrote it off they would need licensing at that point. 

In addition, they did a great job with our child for a time but we did notice our toddler has become nearly completely withdrawn in the last 2 months there (only when going there). There was also an incident with a pretty severe bruising injury last month (thankfully just that) and we brought her to the Doctor. We also noticed recently the new people she would get, would leave pretty quickly after joining (a few weeks to a month after). With all that in mind we won’t lie we have been quietly looking at other options. 

She kept insisting this is the price she could do. She was a great cheap rate before, so we weren’t surprised at the increase but more the timing and way it was done. We are making more and they know that, but I don’t think people realize in our business over half of that goes right back into the business or bank or employees - not our pockets. If this was a “I can’t feed my family” issue we would have made something work starting now but from what’s being communicated it is they want to do more extracurriculars - which is ok for them to say, nothing wrong there. We really felt it was the all or nothing approach (we had to pay this starting now or find a new daycare - where in our market the daycares we could switch to are 6mo to a year out). This would require me leaving my job (husband and I are both employed) and they know this. It almost felt we had been backed into a corner knowing we had no other options. 

They were upset when we said we had to think about it because of our budget at this time (with more advanced notice we probably could’ve moved things around and done it). They began to throw out somewhat guilt tripping words about us showing them respect and value, which it truly wasn’t that. We understand a rate increase but our self employed business was shut down by coronavirus for 2 months and we expect it to happen once more. While we were backed into a corner discussing it, my husbands family member that lives with us offered to take over for the same current rate and stay home with her daughter as well. This was ideal for her (who can’t afford daycare), and us in our situation. We let the daycare know and they suddenly asked what we could do after all that time insisting they couldn’t go any lower for a while. We told them the family member had offered, and the conversation continued to get even shorter and uncomfortable. We told them we would still pay them for the upcoming month even if it was physically cut shorter, and have a transition period out to help as much as we could. As well as give references.

A few months ago we lost our second daughter late in the pregnancy. The devastation of this has hit me so hard. One of the effects of the grief had been that I feel so lonely and worry a lot about having few mum friends that I can meet up with during the week.

It baffles me because this kid would at least TRY food he hasn't seen, but now even food we have given him before, he won't eat. We try to be as patient as possible with him and try to encourage a few bites, show him that we are eating the same thing as him, and reinforce that we won't eat until the next meal/snack. Sometimes we have to leave the table and he'll start picking at his food and eat a bit. I never tell him to finish every bite but to eat what he can.

As a parent, this stresses me out because I feel as if he isn't getting enough nutrients/etc. throughout the day, although he acts just fine after meals.

Had to stop because he was waking over 5 times a night just for boob and it was exhausting. I didn't want him going on to bottles cos that was just gonna be another sleep crutch and I wanted him to sleep independently. Not to mention how bad they are for teeth! 
So anyway, my partner has a son who is 3 and he still has bottles, makes my skin crawl cos he sucks them so hard cos obviously they are for infants, and the sound makes me feel so sick. 
But because his eldest is still on bottles at age 3, my partner insisted that our son NEEDED a bottle and it was totally harmless. 
I told him our health visitor strongly advised against it and told me not to, he told me health visitors can't be trusted cos they all have different opinions to each other. 
Then I get the guilt trip of ""taking comfort from a baby"" - please bear in mind that he also called me a terrible mother when I refused to leave our son to Cry It Out when he was 8 months old. He left his eldest to Cry It Out at 6 months old, so taking comfort away from a baby is really not something he can lecture me on. 
ANYWAY fast forward to now, our son is 16 months old and I recently bought both the boys a NUK sippy to replace their bottles. My son will happily drink from any kind of cup in the day, including an open cup, but at sleep times he needs his bottle. Problem is he will drink the whole thing before falling asleep (9oz) and if he wakes in the night like he often does, be won't go back off without another 9oz. 
I need to get him off the bottle cos 18+oz a night surely can't be good for him and I need him to self settle and I just hate bottles man I want them GONE out of the house. 
But like I said whenever I bring it up I just get shit on and guilt tripped. 
I can't leave him to cry without one cos that means I'm a terrible mum too! 
So what the hell do I do??

To illustrate my point. She has figured out that you make plurals by adding s. So in her mind if dog -&gt; dogs, cat -&gt; cats, then sheep must be sheeps. A typical ""conversation"" would then be

T: look, many sheeps

M: yes, there are three sheep in the picture

She has always been an atrocious sleeper, a few of our friends with children who have stayed the night or looked after her for the night have said she was the worst sleeper they had ever known. We had to travel when she was 5-7 months which was the peak of the worst of it. We sleep trained from 9 months going in at 5, then 10, then 15 minute intervals and it slowly got better until she slept through the night consistently from about 14 months, with the exception of some sleep regressions and sickness.

The thing that has never gotten much better is the put down. She has always fallen asleep crying or screaming with the exception of a few short patches when she was one. We have a long and consistent sleep routine - bath, three books, songs and bed. The songs are part of the problem because no matter how many we sing there is crying screaming for ""more wheels on the bus"".

We had twins 10 weeks ago and it has only gotten worse. We had to be away from my daughter for three days during the birth since she wasn't able to visit due to Covid. She has always been anxious but the separation made her so anxious she developed a temporary stutter. On one hand I want to go extreme cry it out for everyone's sake, on the other hand I fear that may make things worse if her problem is rooted in seperation anxiety.

She doesn’t do that with me, and if I literally just poke my head through the door she stops crying. She’s totally fine with him during the day and she seeks him out and loves playing with him during his break and lunch (he’s working from home now).

We started potty training our almost 3 year old toddler about 4 days ago.  We are following the Oh Crap method and not having a lot of success.  The issue is that she holds it until she is ready to burst.  This morning she held it from when she woke up until 1 pm when she went down for a nap at which point we put on a pull-ups,  which immediately peed and pooped in. It’s been almost 4 hours since she woke up from her nap and still has gone again. 

She tells us she has to go potty and it’s pretty obvious but then every time she approaches the potty she says “I don’t want to!” and runs off.  This repeats every minute or two for about half an hour until she bursts. When we do get her to sit on the potty she sits for about 2 seconds yells “done!” (she is not) and jumps off.  Eventually she does use it or has an accident in a dash to the potty.  When she does eventually use the potty she is super excited and talks about it after only for the whole process to repeat a few hours later. 

We have tried increasing her fluids but she only wants water (we have her water bottles everywhere). She has had a half dozens popsicles and we have had multiple tea parties.  Still the girl is like a whiny camel.  I don’t know how to get more into her without and IV.  We feel like if we are able to get her to go more often she will get more comfortable with the feeling. 

We realized we were over prompting in the beginning so we stepped way back and only respond when she says she has to go. 

It feels like we have waited too long and started too soon! Also this has been the same since day one.  We are concerned about her getting a UTI from holding it for so long. 

Does anyone have an tips for getting a toddler to relax and release better? Any tricks for getting them to drink more? Really any advice would be appreciated.

He was evaluated during locked down and is now going to speech therapy twice a week, early intervention speech therapy through zoom and early intervention OT through zoom.  He has made improvements but I am still worried.

1) His eye contact isn't that good.  You need to either be at his level or within his zone of proximity for him to make eye contact.

2) He doesn't follow directions.  When he was diagnosed it was determined that his receptive language was higher than his expressive language but I am not getting it.

3) He doesn't respond to his name.  Part of it is we call him different cute names but I am worried and unsure if it has anything to do with the delay.

4) He can ask for more, say all done, water( wawa), bye-bye, mama, dada and a few other words.  He likes to sing and count.  He can recite his numbers almost to ten. 

5) He talks to himself.  It can be singing, counting or random toddler talk.  

This is my first child and all the children my family and friends have do not have this delay.

I have a 2.5 year old. She is mostly potty trained a la 'Oh Crap"" method. My trouble is night training. Shes been day trained since 2 years old with minimal accidents. This includes nap time. I know she can hold it for hours at a time. 


What we've done: pyramid method of less water at night. Usually something we miss becasue its hot AF. Even when we were on top of it it didn't seem to make a difference. We've tried waking her up at 10p and 2a. Adjusting as needed. Almost always missing with minimal succsess. Weve tried whispering. Weve tried role play (which helped the naps). I got a bed alarm because I think shes just a heavy sleeper but shes scared of loud sounds. My niblings ""Night trained themselves by 6 or 7"" and the 9 year old still wears a bed time pull up. 


My next idea is to reintroduce night diapers for 2 weeks and the bed alarm.

I'm so frustrated.

Son is 2.5 and is so stubborn about mealtime, mostly dinner. I feel like I've read and tried all the advice.

We eat dinner every night at the same time. We eat at the table as a family. I give him small portions and do not pressure him to eat. I may ask him to try something but I'm not pushy. If he says he's not hungry, I tell him that it's ok but he has to stay at the table while mom and dad eat. He screams most of the time. He asks for other food and I calmly tell him he has to eat what's on his plate first.  He screams. We try the one bite rule and sometimes he'll end up eating everything without further prompts. I try talking about the food. Just what it is, what it tastes like. I try to be fun about it too but that ends up feeling like tricking him (think here comes the airplane) and/or it's just so exhausting. I keep my calm at the dinner table but have to leave sometimes because I feel the frustration building. 

And I know the general advice is that he'll eat when he's hungry. I'm not worried about him starving, I just don't want to deal with the waking up in the middle of the night and the terrible mood that almost always comes when he doesn't eat. But I do because I don't want to battle him every night to try to force him to eat. I'm so sick of this.

So tonight, I'm really over it and my SO offers to ""fix this."" He wants to send him to bed as soon as he tantrums over mealtime. I told him I'm not comfortable with that, there has to be another way. He doesn't think there is. I'm not saying I'm doing it the right way but I want us to come to an agreed solution that isn't punishing a 2 year old with bedtime. And he says that if we put him to bed as punishment, we close the door and let him cry without going in there. He knows that I'm not ok with this and then says that he doesn't know why he brought it up since I'd never let him do that. So now, not only am I frustrated with my child, I'm angry at SO.

Since then she has occasionally had a dry night pull up and I think we were making progress but she would have accidents and we backslid because I had a baby and I just couldn’t handle being woken up by her telling me she wet herself and now I have to change her and rinse her off, take off the padding on the bed, and potentially spend the next day washing the pillow and her comforter (if she peed while sleeping on these things which was common). It’s a lot to do when your actual baby is waking up every 2 hours and you work full time. Anyway, point is now I have her in pull ups and I think she feels free to pee because it’s there. She rarely wakes up dry anymore. And also, she’s addicted to carrot juice (Trader Joe’s brand pure carrot juice with no other ingredients). I feel bad denying her this with her dinner. 

I know about limiting liquids but I sort of keep a cup of water by her at night which she occasionally partakes in but not always. It’s hard to limit liquids when she comes home from daycare at like 6, eats dinner by 7, and goes to bed around 9.  It’s like not giving her anything at all to drink with food? Plus, I know I occasionally need a drink at night especially if I’ve had salty foods that day. Just feels wrong :( just wondering how truly important it is especially if coupled with what I’m about to say next:

A common suggestion is taking them to pee in their sleep around midnight. (Do I still need to really limit liquids if I take her to pee?) But the real issue is: I tried this many times but I miss the damn window every time! How does this work and is it the key to dry nights?

I’m a swirling vat of emotions today and I will discuss this in therapy on Saturday but that seems so far away!

Ok so a week and a half ago I was at the park with my 3.5yo soon, 5mo daughter, and met up with a friend. 
We were there a LONG time, like 3 hrs. Toddler is a sometimes napper but didn’t nap this particular day.
Ok so on to triggering event-

I was in my lil shade structure with baby, it’s like a half of a tent, chatting with friend. My toddler comes over and starts throwing his body against the tent which his little sister is inside.
I asked him to stop and let him know he might hurt his baby sis.
He doesn’t stop.
I distract him and get him to draw some chalk on the concrete in front of us. 
After a few minutes I go back to tent to check on baby, he comes back a few minutes after that and starts smashing against the tent/shade structure again. 
I ask him to stop, and then get up and physically remove him and suggest we go try to play over in the bark or sand box. Which he does for a short while.
Then he comes back again and keeps hitting and smashing the shade structure, up until a pole cracks. 

I grab him by the shoulders, yell at him and am obviously pissed from my expression.
Yes I was a hot, tired, frustrated angry mom in that moment.

I see my friend wince, in that moment it makes me feel like a monster.

At this point the behavior of knocking the shade structure stops, he goes on to play. 
It seems all is well. 


Then... radio silence from my friend all week. She says she is busy and can’t talk until the weekend.
I decided to just give her space. 
Hit her up Saturday and it’s an off day when I don’t have my 3.5y/o toddler son. 
She had me come over to her apt with baby, she has no kids and I think she is more comfortable being in more adult spaces.  we talked and she told me it was triggering for her to watch me punish my son. Reminded her of her own childhood- which she admits she has largely blocked out. Her mom abandoned her and her younger sister at a young age and was abusive. 


So now I’m at a bit of a crossroads.
In the moment she brought it up I was all “oh yeah I could have tried other things to get him to stop and I’ll try not to discipline him in front of you” because I’m just a damn people pleaser and I never actually check in with myself before answering (I’m a work in progress!)

Ok well now that I’ve had time to think- I did try other methods first- none were working, and I know my spirited kid- I know what works for him and what doesn’t. 
And how can I make that promise? 
I need to be able to discipline my kid freely because, they’re my kids and it’s and me and my husband choice how we parent. I can’t promise he isn’t going to be on one, like he sometimes is.

Now I feel like avoiding her, and Im starting to question our friendship (there’s other issues as well like not having similar goals and interests)

I have such little free time away from my toddler son, how can I carry on a friendship that is conditional to me not being with my toddler? 

Anyways does anyone have any experience navigating anything like this? 
I’m definitely going to be discussing this with my therapist on Saturday. 
I’ve talked to a few other mom friends and the consensus is it’s not my responsibility to take care of her emotional trauma. 

I can’t heal her trauma by being a “good” mom, and it sucks that I somehow am making it worse by disciplining my kids- which in my opinion is actually being a good mom.

Well, let me paint the picture for you guys on what happened today... 

Our heat pump has had trouble since it was installed two years ago, well we had a fella come out to check it out. While the guy was here my son was napping (or so I thought). In the midst of the fellas inspection, my husband came home from work. When hubby came home, kiddo “woke up”. I went to check on the kid, open the door, it smells a little stinky. Okay, cool he pooped (in his diaper). No big deal right? Then I see him... head to toe in poop.... he somehow managed to take his pants off, spread his poop everywhere, and even peed in a play toy tool box? So I run him to my husband who was doing his after work business in the bathroom. Panicking because there’s a repairman over who could walk inside at any moment to witness one of the greatest joys in parenting, I’m pounding on the bathroom door telling my poor hubby he needs to open the door because I’ve got a poop covered kid in my hands! The repairman walks in the house just as I’m shoving my smelly child into my husband’s arms and trying to close the bathroom door at the same time. I probably looked panicked because the look on the guys face was pure concern. I asked him if he had kids, to which he said yes, I was like great you’ll understand then, “we had a situation..” he gave me a look that all parents can relate to. 

After the guy left, my husband and I looked at each other and said, at the same time, “it’s time for poop-proof pjs.”

I have a 16 month old, he eats whatever we eat for dinner. Every meal, he eats a little bit and then cries because he wants down. So we get him down and he continues to eat from our plates. I let him before because I didn't want him to starve, but I have decided that I need to do something about it so that he doesn't think it's ok to walk around the house with food. Starting today I am not going to feed him unless he is in his high chair. Breakfast went ok, he only tried to get food from me once before he decided he was done. Lunch didn't go as well. He stayed in his high chair for about 7 minutes and then got out. When he tried to get more food, I told him that he couldn't eat unless he was in the high chair. So he tried to get back in, I helped him up and gave him two more bites before he wanted down again and wanted more of my food. 

My questions are:
 
Is this an ok method to use to get him to stay sitting for the meal? Or is there a better way? 

How long should I wait before putting him back in the high chair to try again? When he wants to, or like after 5 minutes so that he knows he can't just get up and down?

Because I am OAD, I am letting myself have a lot of fun with this, dammit! 

Every morning, I get him out of bed and take him to my room to nurse in the glider. This morning, in the glider was a LIFE SIZE ELMO! He loves Elmo. I said to Elmo, ""oh! Hi, Elmo! Could I sit down with you?"" When my son figured out who the celebrity in my room was, he lost it. He said, ""ELMO ELMO ELMO!"" and jumped to give him hugs and kisses. Then after nursing, he smiled so big at me and said, ""tank oo, mama. Tank oo, mama.""   


THEN!

I told him that before we eat our breakfast, we should go to the playroom just because... why not! So we did, and in the playroom was a wooden new table and chairs! For the last few months, he has repurposed an old step stool as a ""desk."" It was time to upgrade, and on the table was a nice puzzle with things that move (cars, trains, etc.). We ate breakfast at his new table, and he loved the puzzle. Got more ""tank oo, mama!"" 

AND THEN!

Instead of saying ""no"" to a morning pre-daycare walk, I said ""fuck it"" to myself and we walked all around our neighborhood. He pointed out all the cars, trees, lamp posts, and puppies. He giggled. After the walk, he was very happy to get in the car.

What was in the car?!??!?!?!

A small Elmo! ... And a tractor! He squealed, clapped his hands, and right before I closed his door, he said, ""KISS, MAMA!"" and puckered his lips out to me. On the whole ride to daycare, he said a combination of ""Tactah!"" (tractor) and ""I luh MAMA.""

I am very excited for this evening wherein I will order chicken tender takeout from the only restaurant he loves, which coincidentally happens to be the most expensive in town (oh well, it's okay). He will also get a homemade birthday cookie, and a trip to the park (no playground, but lots of open space and no one is around).

He’s not huge on cuddling, we’ve never co-slept, he’ll reluctantly give hugs and kisses if he wants something (like gummies), the man likes his space. It’s fine. 

He is, however, deeply attached to his stuffed elephant security blanket, who we lovingly refer to as Ellie. He’s had her since infanthood. She is not the original Ellie, however, as we lost her during his first birthday trip to the east coast last August. 

I have really bad ADHD and lose important things all. The. Time. My keys. My wallet. My shoes. My phone. It really is a miracle that it’s been a year since I lost his last Ellie. 

Naturally I’m worried that something will happen to his Ellie. He actually has two right now, but he prefers to sleep with both (I bought the second one for him to use when I wash the other one because he carries it around everywhere and it reeks). 

Anyways. Unfortunately for me, Carter’s no longer makes his specific brand of Ellie so my attempt to buy a third one has ended with me learning that the stuffed animal I bought for $8 a few months ago can now only be bought for $40 plus taxes and shipping on eBay from uniquely evil people who have entire eBay stores dedicated to buying bulk amounts of discontinued security blankets and selling them at a 500% mark up to stressed out parents of attached children. 

I have so many questions. 

How do they know what’s going to be discontinued and what to stalk up on?
Don’t they feel even a little guilty preying on the attachment of children for profit?

Anyway, she speaks fairly clearly ( I can understand 100% and pediatrician feels they can understand her as well).  She is speaking in 7-10 word sentences consistently so I’m not worried about the amount of words she says, I’m just curious if her pronunciation is something I need to start being concerned about.  By concerned I mean, possibly seeking intervention for a speech therapist.
She does not pronounce ‘r’s -they sound more like ‘w’s and her ‘l’ words sounds like ‘y’.  Think ‘Yama, yama, red pajama”

Tantrums are rare and usually when she's teething or not feeling well. I've been on vacation for a week and we've been spending lots of time together and the past few days she's been quite aggressive and cranky. It's mostly about the fact she wants some space to do things on her own that she just can't do. I'm pretty good about stopping and giving her some time but today she lost it three separate times:

1) Trying to walk up the slide. She normally can do this but was wearing different shoes. She kept falling before she got to the top. I asked if she wanted help and she shook her head no. Then she got herself so worked up she was crying and still trying to do it (she is quite persistent). So finally I tried to hold her hand and she swatted it away and had a complete meltdown.

2) We went for a walk and she wanted to pull her wagon. She did it quite well for awhile but then she started letting go and leaving it behind. But she still wanted to do it and wouldn't let me pull. Eventually I had to tell her I was pulling and she could walk or go in the wagon. Meltdown.

3) She wanted to play dress up with my head necklaces. We had about 20 minutes of fun and then she managed to get herself tangled. I tried to help...cue the swatting and eventual meltdown. I would have loved to leave her to it but she was going to hurt herself or break the necklace.

So my question is: Is this a new normal given her age or likely just a phase? Any suggestions on how to deal with this behaviour? I feel so sad I want to help but it's what she wants least. How can I best help her emotionally?

In the last week she would get fussy close to bed time like normal and has been okay with getting into her bed around the normal bed time of 7pm-ish (but not thrilled like before) and I watch her on the baby cam laying down quietly, flipping pages through books, playing and playing with her stuffed animals. She only falls asleep around 8 if not a little bit after.

My question is, do you guys think that she is ready for her bedtime to be moved up to a little bit later? Or, since she lays quietly for that whole hour before bed she's content to just chill out and relax by herself before going to sleep?

I should mention that she takes one 1.5 hr nap during the day but sometimes likes to just lay down in her crib by herself and chill out for 15-30 minutes without napping, just to get a little peace and quiet during the day. So I wonder if that's what she's doing before she actually falls asleep.

Formatting. You know. 

When I was on vacation with my dad &amp; fam in FL (BC - before COVID) there were 3 toddlers there.  The twin toddlers were a mess, and I don’t blame them one bit.  They were super clingy to mom, they don’t see our side of the family a ton.  Everyone offered to try and hold one/soothe one/play with one but it just didn’t work.  They ended up tantrumming a TON because all they wanted was mom.  My dad, while all this was happening, would huff and puff around the house.  He would slam things, slam doors, stomp around.  

Like... are you in competition with these little guys or what?  Looking back now, as annoying as it was, it was comical to see a man in his late 50s going just as hard.

Fast forward to this afternoon.  My 2.5 year old is having the tantrum of his life.  Prob his biggest one yet; Stomping, screaming, crying, trying to hit/throw, running back and forth through our apartment.  We live on the first floor.  My landlord likes to stomp back.  My landlord stomped back, then proceeded to the basement where he blared music super loud (it blares through my house from down there).  He tucked my laundry basket (with dirty clothes in it) that was in front of my washing machine under his dirty sink for some reason.  You would think with COVID going around maybe he wouldn’t want to touch my mesh hamper with dirty laundry in it?  Then he slams the basement door and his door on his way back up.  

Landlord, buddy, I get it.  Trust me, I get it.  I’m frustrated too.  I can either be a part of the problem, or I can be a part of the solution.  I promise you
I’m trying every possible thing under the sun to calm my kid down.  I promise you.  

What is it with grown adults that do these weird passive aggressive motions in reaction to toddlers?  To 2 year olds that are still figuring out their emotions and how to deal with things?   Who’s the real winner in this competition?  It’s frustrating for everyone involved.  So let’s add to the chaos by acting like adults and throwing and slamming things around too.  

I’m thankful that I have a small bubble of friends that will let us use their backyards.  It’s raining here today, and today was the very first day I didn’t take my kid somewhere to burn energy for probably the last 3 months?  Can I repeat that?  Today was the very first day I didn’t take my kid somewhere to burn energy in 3 months.  I’m also giving birth in 4 weeks to kid #2, just to put that in perspective for ya.  

My landlord, at the beginning of the summer, yelled at me for filling up a 20 gallon Tupperware about halfway with water for my kid to play in.  Yelled at me for using the hose and yelled at us for playing on his grass.  I wonder if he has memory problems... he ran out to his porch and said, “I told you not to touch my damn hose!” Sorry, but you didn’t.  You just did now tho, and I won’t use it anymore.  

He has since sprayed his grass with a ton of pesticides and has ruined it.  There’s yellow spots all over it.  I take a small joy in knowing that he flipped on us for being in the yard on his grass, but then proceeds to ruin it himself.  

So my point with that little tidbit too is - imagine if I didn’t have a small bubble of people that let us use their yards and social distance from us?  And I couldn’t get my kid out to burn some energy during this pandemic?   I think we’d all lose our minds.  

Anyways, I’m frustrated.  I needed a safe place to vent.  Hope all you parents of toddlers out there are doing well and get some sweet sanity this weekend in whatever form you can.

I live abroad on different continent than my family and friends. I haven’t had any support with my son other than my husband. I visited my home country once when my baby was 9 months and my MIL has visited us twice. Other than that I’ve had to figure everything out by myself. First year was awful but now it’s going better. 
I’m just wondering what and how much I should actually do and play with my son. He spends most of his time exploring our house and yard. And I spend my time following him making sure he doesn’t hurt himself or eat something inappropriate. But it is sooooo boring. Before when he just started walking it was also exhausting to constantly support him, lift and carry him. My feet and back were in serious pain. Sometimes still are. I sometimes struggle to take care of myself since it feels like he requires me to be beside him all the time. Screen time has been a life saver. But it’s still hard. I know that small kids are difficult and maybe I should not complain and just wait for him to grow. 
We wanted to have another child and now feels like a good time but I have no idea how I’m able to do this pregnant. And honestly the thought of being tied to a small person for the next years just make me anxious. Before I had my child I honestly naively thought that at some point the kid would play with his toys and I could sit and read a book or at least cook and do chores without someone whining and screaming. Does someone have this and would like to share how it can accomplished? Or am I just expecting too much too soon? Probably it would be different without COVID since atm I can’t really take him anywhere or see anyone. 
My husband is great and takes over after work but he currently needs to work a lot. We don’t really see anyone else or go anywhere but we have a huge yard.
Can someone share their routines or tips what kind of activities I could introduce to him? We have tons of toys but he is not that interested in those.

We have no family to help, so when my daughter was around 2 we hired a nanny for a half day once a week so I could have some kind of break. 

Between that and taking my daughter to playdates or classes or even the playground I was able to cope. Once covid hit those small pressure relief valves dried up. I would definitely identify as an HSP (highly sensitive person). My cortisol goes through the roof with loud sounds, no alone time, too much physical touch, etc... All normal toddler things. Now it is just an unending onslaught of stimulation all day demanding my every ounce. She is definitely going through a normal pushing boundary phase and despite my best gentle, consistent, compassionate, patient but firm parenting I just fucking can't deal with it after 2 hours of a doom loop. 

We were going to wake up, have breakfast, get ready for the day, play pretend for 15 minutes (her absolute favorite and my worst nightmare), then put on our shoes, walk to the mailbox to mail cards she made to family, and then have a small sweet treat outside. I laid it all out, prepared her for transitions, got her so happy while playing pretend, got her super excited about going outside and having a treat, but then we get to the part where we need to get our shoes on and it all goes out the window. 

""Mama put my shoes on!""
That's not a very nice way to ask for help. Do you need help figuring out which shoe goes on which foot?
""No! I'm not putting them on! You put them on!""
You know how to put on shoes (sets them out in front of her). Left shoe here *pointing* right shoe here
""NOOOOO! You do it!""
Ok it sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's take a break.

Then comes the screaming kicking meltdown that I get her to calm down from and starts yet again because I still won't put her shoes on for her. 

This happened 3 times in a row and I was so exhausted I just laid down on the floor next to her and started sobbing. This happens most days now and if it happens in the morning then all my energy is completely gone for the rest of the day. I feel tapped and completely empty. I muddled through the rest of the day numb and unengaged which then meant bedtime was a horrid disaster. I know she just needs love and attention but when she has screamed at me multiple times I want to curl into a ball or walk out the front door. I don't like being around her anymore. I dread waking her up in the morning no matter how much I psych myself up for a good day or at least an ok day. I want to just disappear and never have to do this again.

I started searching for online talk therapy and I'm having no luck. All in time zones 3-4 hours ahead of me and the only free time I have to talk is at 7pm. She doesn't nap anymore and quiet time consists of playing with play doh while I do dishes for 20 minutes or watching 30-60 minutes of a show which she demands I watch with her. The other time theoretically, would be weekends when my husband isn't working but I know she'd eventually come banging on the door so I'd probably have to talk to a therapist in our car. I have no one other than my husband to talk to. I feel completely trapped. I don't want to do this anymore but I also don't know what to do. There's no end in sight for this pandemic, there's no relief coming, it's just a horrible grind every day, and all I can do is count down the days till she's older and hope she's not too messed up by then. I want to skip the toddler years. Thanks for reading. Time to try to go to bed...

Has anyone tried this for their toddler?

My daughter is currently 19 months and is at the bare minimum for her expected speech development (around 5 words) but she can understand most things and can point out multiple objects, animals, and people when asked and even follow simple tasks. At her last doctors appointment, it was brought to our attention that we may have to consider speech therapy if she doesn’t catch up on her verbal skills. 

We constantly read to her, talk to her in our normal voices (by narration) and engage her with Montessori style activities daily. Our area still isn’t safe due to covid so I worry that because she hasn’t been able to interact with enough kids her age, it might be why she hasn’t felt the need to practice on her talking. I’m honestly at a loss of what to try or do for her right now since we were told to wait until she’s 2 to start any early intervention.

There is a very violent toddler in his classroom and as bad as it might make me look, I admit I'm always stalking my child on the daycare cameras. 

I've presenced several times this toddler attack random kids by pushing, smacking, biting, pinching, tossing things at others, etc. This baby acts spontaneously out of nowhere totally unpredictable I saw he was having fun during gym class bouncing balls and running around and all of a sudden just attacked my son by pushing and throwing himself over him and hitting.

The teacher ran and separated them, placed the child in time out then checked my crying child for bite marks and tried to calm him down. 

I totally get that at this age kids can do this, I was explained by the school twice when my son was bitten that kids have that reaction when other kids invade their space but I see that the child goes towards a child that is at the other end of a room quietly playing and just attacks.

I honestly don't know what to do, I feel bad for my child because he is very passive he let's other kids snatch toys and he just goes and find another one, he is very non confrontational you can even see him after being pushed just walking away just to have the child go and grab him again and slam him down until he cries.

I also know that this happens really fast and the daycare people even keeping a close eye on this one child can miss things because they have other children and activities to do. 

I don't know what I want to achieve from this post, maybe I'm just venting, I know some of you might be moms to toddler that do this and that it could be my kid doing this in the future, they are not even 2 years old and are innocent, it's a phase, I'm no expert... I don't know I just feel bad for my kid. 

Any experience or ideas on how do deal are greatly appreciated.

Just as the title says, transition is hard. My daughter is 15m, and I’m due with her sister in 19 weeks. I’ve been co sleeping with her since she was 6 months old. But now that things are changing, she realllyyyy needs to get in her own bed. 
We got the toddler bed/mattress/bedding, updated our baby monitor system. And I’m just having a hell of a time getting her to sleep in her bed. 
When someone else puts her to bed it’s normally not an issue, for nap or bedtime, but that isn’t always an option. Not really looking for advice, just needed to vent. 
I’m stressed out and really just want her sleeping in her own bed. I know it’s a process and will take awhile, I’m just super discouraged about it! She did 2 naps and 2 partial nights really successfully, but I can’t seem to get her back in bed myself since then!

His parents are aging and my parents just retired and moved across the country. 

But the thing is that she doesn’t live in the same city that we do, so if we were to die the kids would not only lose their parents, but their home, schools, friends, and everything they have ever known and this has been on my mind for a while. 

Also, we are pregnant with our third child and she has one child already with plans to expand her family as well. So I am worried that having 5 or 6 kids (some of whom in this scenario who would require a lot of emotional support after losing my husband and I) would completely overwhelm anyone. 

Also, it came out last night that she doesn’t particularly like me, which is what it is. I can be loud and opinionated, I often don’t think before I speak, and she is not the first person to tell me I am annoying. It is never my intention to be this way it is just my personality and I can’t help it. What worries me is that my daughter has a lot of my personality traits, while she adores my daughter(5) now, I worry that the cuteness of my daughter will wear off and she will feel the same about her as she does about me. 

Part of me just can’t imagine my daughter losing both her parents, having to move to a different state, lose her entire friend and support network, and then being stuck with someone who finds her annoying. 

The other thing is that my parents are young, in their early 50s. And when talking with my mom several months ago she said that she completely supports whatever I want to do with our will, but if needed she would step up and take care of our kids if we wanted her to and that she wouldn’t even mind to move into our home at least for a while so that my kids could stay in their schools and keep their friends. This likely wouldn’t even be an option for my sister in law because she has her own child and a full time job. 

I realize that both my husband and I dying is a super unlikely event, but we have to plan for it nonetheless. I don’t know what to do. Part of me is wants to change the will so that my parents get our kids, but I do think my sister in law is a great mom and I would hate to take away my parents retirement that they have worked so hard for. 

Obviously any decision won’t be made today or even in the next few months, i don’t want to do it right after the talk we had last night (it will just come off as I was mad that she said I was annoying, ((which I’m not mad about, I know I am annoying... )) and am punishing her or something) and I want to have this baby before I do anything else.

My husband's work tends to go in interval's where he'll need to do something for 15-45 minutes and then he won't need to do anything for half an hour or several hours depending on the project.

We're also in the middle of an extreme heat wave. I have just recently been able to get back into a daily routine of a walk, though it has to be very first thing after breakfast before it gets too hot. Sometimes my toddler will walk a few blocks, sometimes he won't. He usually has his morning nap in the stroller. I would stop and play at a park but they are still all closed, but sometimes he will run around in a field if I let him loose. I'm going to try to get him outside in the backyard for some play time after dinner and before bed if possible to get him a bit more exercise. During his awake times, for probably 4 hours total during the day, he is non stop movement running around the house, climbing on furniture, reaching on his tiptoes, playing chase with me or his dad or a cat, practicing the stairs, you name it. I was relying pretty heavily on Peppa Pig for the first few weeks figuring out my newborn and recovering, but we've really successfully cut screen time out of his day except for diaper changes without too much fuss.

Now to my questions, since you know everything I'm already doing. First, how much exercise does he need in terms of minutes and intensity? Is his current playtime enough? I've been thinking I should incorporate more structured exercise into his day, but I'm not sure how to do it. He's pretty independent and doesn't like to be told what to do (as if you've never met a toddler!). I've been thinking though that he would like something like dance videos like just dance or kids Zumba, but I'm worried about introducing the screen back into his day. What do you think? And finally, how much outdoor time should he be getting each day? I want him to get as much fresh air as possible, but heat stroke is a real concern right now, especially for the baby who has to tag along with us for everything.

So I am currently STRUGGLING with my son's nap and I want to know if this is a phase or something else. 


My son is 22 months, with a slight cognitive and speech delay. Basically, he's probably closer to an 18 month old in some areas. He's very active and has never been a great sleeper. We decided to finally sleep train a few months ago (my husband was laid off for a bit and could finally really help). It took awhile, but he's finally sleeping through the night most of the time. The problem is about 3 weeks ago, he suddenly started freaking out about his nap. He used to go down around 11:30 and sleep for 1.5 hours. He's been doing this since before we did the sleep training. And when I said suddenly, I mean suddenly. That Monday he slept normally, then Tuesday he started fighting his nap. 


He just doesn't seem tired at 11:30 anymore. I've tried putting him down at his normal time and he just jumps around or screams like he's dying. I've tried moving his nap later, with the same results. I've tried being really busy for the first half of the day, with the same results. Currently I'm just letting him go until he passes out and sleeps for 2-3 hours, but that puts him waking up around 5 and that seems soooo late. We try to get him into bed around 8-8:30, which is difficult when he's waking up so late. He's taking 45-60 minutes to fall asleep at bedtime.


During all of this he seems to be making some sort of mental leap, his receptive and expressive speech is improving dramatically. Could this be the cause of the nap problems? 


He's also started doing some newish comfort things. He's become obsessed with my stomach. He pats it or wants to lie on it, like skin to skin. He's also started covering his ears, but just in general, not necessarily when there are loud sounds. I read that that can be a comfort thing. He also seems snugglier. He's always been snuggly, but this seems constant. I'm 18 weeks pregnant. I'm not showing much, but maybe he's reacting to that somehow? 


So, I guess I'm wondering if he's trying to drop his nap or going through some phase? And what do I do about it? Any advice is appreciated!

I've given him books in his crib, and we've tried to make a game out of ""see how high you can stack your blocks"" or whatever to keep him busy while I do the bare minimum to keep myself afloat with my workload. No dice. He wants us, which is cute but totally making me nuts.

Obviously TV is an option, but he usually already does some of that after dinner and I'd rather not add more. #martyr
