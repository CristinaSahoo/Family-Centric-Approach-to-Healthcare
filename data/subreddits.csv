My 2yo doesn’t like the potty.,"Hey!

I’ve been trying to potty train my daughter, but whenever I put her on the potty she will hold everything in and cry and as soon I put her pull-up back on, she does her business. 

I’ve tried the schedule method, where you assign certain times to go to the potty, the “naked” method, where you don’t put any diaper/pull-up on, and I’ve tried taking her to the potty every time I have to use the restroom, but nothing seems to work. 

What do you think I should do? I don’t want her to be scared/cry when it’s comes to potty time, but I’m lost as to what would be the best approach to this. 

All advice is welcome! Thanks.",1,"My 2yo doesn’t like the potty. Hey!

Is it inconsiderate to ask daycare to not let our toddler take a nap?,"So, our almost 3 y/o started going to daycare again a week ago. (She was in daycare until March and then stopped attending due to covid and a relocation.) During this time, she kind of stopped napping. A typical day for her would be waking up around 7 am, going about the day without a nap and falling asleep around 7:30 or 8 pm. 

Now that she’s started going to daycare again, they have nap time so she sleeps anywhere between an hour to two each day. She now doesn’t fall asleep at night until close to 10 pm. As you can imagine, this has become a bit of a problem for us.

We’re considering asking the daycare to not make her take a nap but we do realize that nap time is when the teachers catch a break. I wanted to ask here if that would be an inappropriate or inconsiderate request. Thanks!",1,"Is it inconsiderate to ask daycare to not let our toddler take a nap?

Headstands in crib...safe?,"So my son is quite the little gymnast, he is constantly doing somersaults and headstands. He does them everywhere, including in his crib. He uses the rails to balance but then lets his legs go and eventually slams hard into the crib railing. I know that once he can climb out of his crib that it is no longer safe and we need to transition but he isn’t climbing. So is this (headstands/somersaults) no longer a safe situation. I know he isn’t hurting himself and he is genuinely having a great time but we are worried that he could fall the wrong way and actually injure himself. Also, I know he would still do headstands in a toddler/twin bed so we wouldn’t be eliminating that, but he wouldn’t have the rails to slam into.

Nap poop manipulation,"My 18 month old has this really inconvenient habit of pooping about 20 minutes after being put in his room for his nap. This has been happening consistently for about a month.

I try him on the potty before. He will poop in the potty if he has to go when he's on it, unless it's before nap. I'm pretty sure he's holding it in on purpose.

I've tried changing the timing of lunch and of the nap. He responds by changing the timing of his poop.

He will not sleep with a poop in his pants, which is good. I wouldn't either. I think he's using his poops to manipulate us into visiting him during his nap time/quiet time and I want it to stop. But I can't stop cleaning his diaper. 

I keep the visits short, quiet and boring. I give him a lot of attention so it's not like it's the only interaction he gets. I've also tried winding down the attention before the nap.

I've tried faking him out and putting him in his room earlier, but he won't poop until it's his real nap time.

As soon as the poop is cleaned he goes down for a nap without complaint. It's not that big of a deal except I have another baby to deal with and chores to complete, and honestly just need a break from his energy.

Last night I finally suggested to my wife that we turn the 4 year old’s monitor off and just have the baby on full screen. She isn’t ready to do that.

Should I be concerned or am I overreacting ?,"Hi,

So lately my so who is 2.5 years old been doing something out of the blue. For starters, he wakes up in the middle of the night crying sometimes 2-3 times at night . He wasn’t doing this at all. Also, any time of the day he randomly gets up and close the doors. Whether it’s the room door or bathroom door. To add to that , I use to toss him around in the air sometimes or just bounce in the bed but randomly he’s scared of heights. Even when Myself or my wife pick him up he’s automatically gets terrified as if he experienced something drastic dealing with heights . I’m not sure if he’s having nightmares or what but i can t seem to find what’s causing this. We do have a newborn who just turned a month on yesterday so I lm not sure if that correlates or not . Any advice, thoughts or perspective helps. Thanks in advance",1,"Should I be concerned or am I overreacting ? Hi,  So lately my so who is 2.years old been doing something out of the blue.

Toodler Proofing Front Door Lock in a Rented Apartment,"This weekend we moved to a new apartment. At our old place we had a chain lock on the door that our 20 month old couldn't reach so it was an extra layer of protection once he figured out how to unlock the deadbolt and knob. He has already unlocked our new front door twice on his own!

My question to you all is: What is the best way to solve this? What do y'all do in your apartments? Should I request that the landlord install a chain lock? Should I install one myself?  How do I keep my toddler from unlocking the door easily but safely so that if there were an emergency we could still quickly evacuate?

Ps I know that teaching him to not unlock the door would be best. That is the long game, but for now I just need to keep him safe. 😊",1,"Toodler Proofing Front Door Lock in a Rented Apartment This weekend we moved to a new apartment.

Yet another sleeping rant and seek for suggestion,"Hey all,

Ou 1.5yrs old son has just (couple weeks) stopped breastfeeding and during that time he feels a sleep while on breast, waking up 4-5 times during night. 

Couple days after stopping with breastfeeding we kept him alone with me and while he was sleeping in much longer intervals still being much easier than before - until three days ago. 
We noticed he is teething, stuffy nose and enormous resistance for sleeping. We try to carry him in arms, he wants us to walk him through the house, we let him play without forcing him to sleep he still wants to be carried.
We let him cry in the room, he cries more than one hour and almost lost his voice.

Now this is not sustainable at all but we do not know what to do. He was separated from breastfeeding, he is teething and he can literally cry for more than an hour (we didn’t let him cry longer), he wakes up and again wants to be carried immediately or he continues with super loud crying.

We know we are missing boundaries but we do not know how long can we let him cry, we enjoy being together in bed with him but carrying him in the middle of the night is even more exhausting than before.",1,"Yet another sleeping rant and seek for suggestion Hey all,  Ou 1.5yrs old son has just (couple weeks) stopped breastfeeding and during that time he feels a sleep while on breast, waking up 4-times during night.

How not to drive 1600Km with a Toddler,"About a month ago I had to drive from Poland to the UK with a 19 month old child. It went pretty well so I [documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/ixjyvx/driving_1600km_1000_miles_over_two_days_with_a_18/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) what worked and what didn't.

This weekend I had to return home and the trip was less successful. Large sections of it were such a disaster that I think it's worth recording.

**Breaks in the Journey**

On the way out we were blessed with good weather and could stop in open areas so our child could run around. On the way back it was cold and rainy with strong winds.

Tip: Plan for how to burn energy when your child can't go outside. The only opportunity I had was getting him to go up and down five flights of stairs at the hotel over and over again until he was tired.

**Plan for illness**

Our child came down with a cold on the evening of day 1. Come up with a strategy for how one of you will get enough sleep to be safe to drive the following day when your child is waking up every hour.

**The great tablet debate**

Day 1 - tablet is for emergencies

Day 2 - Tablet can be considered

Day 2 - Last two hours of driving - give him the tablet and do whatever is necessary to keep him entertained. I don't care anymore

**Entertainment**

Learn to hide the weariness in your tone as you read the Gruffalo for the tenth time in a row. Do not suggest that maybe we try a different book as that will lead to screaming.

**Conclusion**

Driving is easy if the weather is nice and you can stop and get them out for an hour of exercise. It's very hard if your child is not napping due to lack of exercise.

**Notes**

Belgian service station food is the best

German service station food is the worst, what sort of animal uses margarine in a sandwich

Stop taking away the f*cking tablet from my kid,"This may be more ranty than anything, but I am also interested to hear what everyone else thinks.

We live with my parents for the time being and my mom is a total narcissist. She inserts herself all the time when we’re disciplining our kid and takes it personally when we don’t do things the way she did (read: authoritative with no empathy). My least favorite thing is that she and now my husband threatens to take away his tablet for everything. Had an accident in your pants? No tablet the rest of the day. Won’t finish your dinner? No tablet. You were rude and disrespectful? No tablet for a week. 

It’s the dumbest punishment ever because she always caves in and gives it back early when she gets annoyed of his 4 year old energy. It’s also placed this emphasis on the tablet as this forbidden fruit. He doesn’t understand the idea of natural consequences because everything is about his tablet.

Tonight, I offered him a choice: should I put him to bed or his baby brother. He wanted to watch an episode of blippi, so he said for me to put baby to sleep. Okay, daddy will tuck him in then. After the video was over, he said nvm mom I changed my mind. I want you now. I said no, because I’ve been trying to teach him that making rash choices have consequences. Cue 20 minute meltdown with him begging me to let him change his mind. Husband started losing his temper and said if he keeps crying, he loses his tablet for a week. I’m like wtf does the tablet have to do with this situation? He wasn’t even watching the tablet in the first place! Then my mom comes creeping in the room. Once she hears why he’s crying, she’s also jumping in with “baby, don’t you want your tablet back in the morning? If so, then stop crying.” OMG ENOUGH WITH THE TABLET ALREADY. 

I want to just take the tablet and hide it forever. But then they’re just offering him their phones when it’s time to eat or he needs to poop, because they’ve trained for him to do that too.

I had to hear backhanded comments about how I’m “getting there” and “I’ll get there someday” even though I have my own apartment I’m actually very content with. Lol that I was able to shrug off. The most annoying part was that my sister knew my toddler was coming over but there were skateboards and boxes and styrofoam (all things that attract toddlers) also a huge new $1,000 flat screen my toddler could easily reach. The entire night all I heard was myself and my family “don’t touch that! Don’t touch this! Don’t go there! Stop!” Over and over. Their apartment was nice and I appreciate them inviting us over but after an hour there I wished they hadn’t. My toddler of course started throwing a fit because she was just being bossed around by everyone and kept being told not to touch everything. (She couldn’t play with the styrofoam because it might get everywhere, she couldn’t play with the little pumpkins because “she might break them”) I had anxiety the entire time trying to stop her from touching their items. On top of that they kept telling her to shush and quiet down because my toddler loves to scream. They kept bragging about their apartment but all it made me do was appreciative of my apartment, although it’s smaller my toddler can run around and be as loud as she wants. Obviously they don’t have kids so of course their apartment wouldn’t be child proof! I’m not mad at them for wanting to keep their apartment nice I’m just ranting because by the end of the night my toddler was so upset she began to do her usual hitting, where she slaps the shit out of me. Of course this behavior shocked my family (my family who never asks about her or sees her) and they once again began making comments. My sister came over and said “omg why is she acting like that” and I angrily snapped back “because she’s 2. She’s a toddler” ... it’s difficult bringing my toddler anywhere but I think that apartment takes the cake. I should’ve planned better and brought her a toy.

Bodily Autonomy/Consent/Girl mom's,"Me and my partner have been together for 4 years, he is stubborn and kind of ignorant and we have two kids together. Both girls! 

His family is super 'huggy and kissy' and mine isn't. I feel like somewhere in between is where id like to be as a parent as I do not enjoy kissing and hugging my MIL and FIL every damn time I walk out of the house. Maybe I'm just a cold bitch but whatever 🤣 

Our oldest daughter (2) is a super lovey girl! She loves kisses and hugs and will wave at anyone, blow kisses and say hi when they walk by no matter who they are. It is adorable and I love it but I know it will mean boundaries in the future. I had a rough time as a teen and my boundaries were crossed many times assault/rape by a previous significant other that I have only recently come to terms with and recognized almost 15 years later. It breaks my heart that this might someday happen to my girls and I want to do everything in my power to make sure they feel comfortable and confident with saying no. 

Now cue my partner and his overbearing family... They come in the door and demand a kiss and hug, even if my toddler turns away from them they follow her and say ""where's granny's kiss?? Where's my hug??"" And laugh when she turns away then they scoop her up and she usually complies. She seems happy but it still bothers me. I always ask her if she wants a hug or a kiss and if she doesn't I don't force it. I usually just blow her a kiss or wave goodnight and then she decides she wants to give me one. 

My partner 'struggle snuggles' her... He scoops her up and squeezes her and forces her to cuddle with him on the couch and says things like ""nope your not going nowhere daddy wants his snuggles"" and she usually is squirming/yelling and trying to get away. I explained to him that it's important to give her the choice of affection and if he doesn't respect her choices that she may think it's ok for other adults to do whatever they want with her and she just has to put up with it. (I think this is an awful message to send to her) and he says it's different because he's her dad. Or different because it's grandma and grandpa. 

I think that even though it's family, it still matters and it makes me have this alarming anxious feeling everytime I hear them ""where's my hug/kiss??"" It just upsets me and I need it to stop. 

Because my SO is being such a jerk about it and my MIL/FIL are the same and think I wasn't loved as a child because I'm not super huggy or cuddly/kissy I need to go about this in a way that seems not about my preferences but 100% about her bodily autonomy which is what takes priority here. I need to see them respect her.

Because my SO is being such a jerk about it and my MIL/FIL are the same and think I wasn't loved as a child because I'm not super huggy or cuddly/kissy I need to go about this in a way that seems not about my preferences but 100% about her bodily autonomy which is what takes priority here. I need to see them respect her.   Thanks everyone xo",34,3,2677,521,Question
Tips for screaming fits?,"Yikes.

Advice on getting toddler to fall asleep by herself?,"Daughter is 2. We used to (many months ago) be able to put her down in her bed and leave her to fall asleep by herself after using the ‘pick up, put down’ method. Then one night she had a nose bleed and was inconsolable so I stayed in her room until she fell asleep. Since that fateful night, she cries when we leave the room so we just take it in turns to sit in her dark room, with our back to her, until she falls asleep. It takes 1h-1h30 every night. That’s quite a large chunk of our time gone each evening. 

How can we help her fall asleep in her room without us being there now? We can’t do the ‘pick up, put down’ method now because she’s simply too heavy. It was back breaking enough a year ago. Please help. 

We have a solid bedtime routine and have recently been trying to get her to bed about 15-20 mins earlier this past week because she is so hyperactive in the evening, leading me to believe she is overtired.

It feels like my toddler gave me the day off yesterday.,"We’ve had a rough couple of weeks but yesterday my toddler had a perfect no tantrum day. 

For reasons that I don’t understand, he did exactly what he was supposed to be doing all day. 

Since I don’t know why it happened replicating yesterday will be impossible but do I ever feel rested and recharged!

Let’s recap:

He slept through the night and started dancing in his crib when he woke up.

He ate his breakfast.

He played in the playground and calmly waved goodbye to the playground when I said it was time to go home.

He ate his snack and lunch.

He took a 2 hour nap.

We went for a nature walk and collected leaves.

He played independently while I cooked dinner.

He ate all of his dinner.

He enjoyed his bath and let me trim his nails.

All of his diaper changes were calm affairs and did not involve any rolling over.

He cleaned up his toys.

He went to bed at a reasonable time and slept through the night.

2.5 Year Old is Allergic to Sleep - STILL. Please Help.,"Ever since my daughter was born, she has hated sleep. From the moment she came out of the womb, she has wanted her eyes to stay open. I have tried every trick in the book and she just refuses. Naps have been non-existent for her for about a year now, and she still fights bedtime more than any kid I've met - and I use to nanny.

A typical night goes like: try to put her to bed, have to hold her hand while she lays in her bed and screams and eventually falls asleep (takes about an hour or longer), then she wakes up two-four hours later screaming to come into our bed, then she wakes about three hours later to either kick us or to scream at the top of her lungs or demand we all wake up. Then she falls back asleep and wakes up about two hours later and is up for the day.

This is incredibly exhausting for all of us, but like I said, I have tried everything I can think of and more.

We have black out curtains on her window, we play white noise (the falling asleep part takes longer for her if we don't), we make sure her room is a good temperature, we have a consistent bedtime and bedtime routine, she wakes herself up at the same time every day -- I just don't know what else we can do. I've even started giving her little melatonin gummies (0.5mg) just before bed and while it makes her go to sleep easier, she is still waking up loads of times throughout the night.

At this point I wonder if she has a sleep disorder or something because it seems like no matter what we do, she will not sleep. I am desperate for help since she is now disturbing her 1yo sister's sleep and having two screaming children at 3:30am is just not something I want to deal with too much longer.",1,"2.Year Old is Allergic to Sleep - STILL.

Advice needed- post daycare and dinner time freakouts,"Hey mamas. I have a 16 month old who recently returned to daycare (back for 3 weeks now), he's loving it there and he's thriving while there. I know it's normal for them to suddenly turn clingy and whiney and throw tantrums the moment they come back from daycare because they've been holding it together all day. We've been implementing some quiet and 1:1 time with him right when he gets home before we get started with dinner, bath, etc. 

It's working well so far to curb the freak outs at the beginning of the night. The problem starts when we get going with the routine and try to move to dinner time.

 New this past week is he doesn't want to get into his high chair, is wanting to climb all over us and is so goddamn wiggly and only wants to sit in our lap. I know he's hungry because he wants to to grab the food and eat, but if we put him in his high chair, HE.FREAKS.THE.FUCK.OUT. we put him down and HE.FREAKS.THE.FUCK.OUT.

Dad finally gives up too, sets him in the crib and lo and behold, this stinker reaches between the wall and back of the crib and pulls out the final paci. With that gotcha grin on his face. Little does he understand we now know about his hiding spot.",28,6,891,175,

Question about cleaning.. parts,I feel a little embarrassed to ask this but how thoroughly do you wash your girls’ labia area? Mine is starting to wipe herself a lot when going pee and I’m afraid she’s not wiping enough. Her area down there is reddish and kind of smelly and itchy I’m sure. I kind of clean down there when giving her a bath but I think the cloths aren’t soft enough so it hurts her so unless I lay her down and clean her with like wipes it doesn’t seem like it’s thorough enough. She doesn’t like wipes in general also. Ideas?,1,Question about cleaning.. parts I feel a little embarrassed to ask this but how thoroughly do you wash your girls’ labia area?

Does anyone have a successful routine to let their kid play/read alone in their room before bed?,"My kid just turned 3. He does not usually fall asleep until 7:45-8 but we put him to bed at 7:15 (he wakes up at 5:30).

Joys of hearing my speech delayed child talk,"My 2.5 year old is speech delayed and has just very recently started putting words together and saying phrases.

How to discipline when your toddler is too smart? I don’t know what else to do.,"My son is 2 and a half and honestly hasn’t needed to be disciplined until recently. He always did a great job and was a great listener until the terrible twos hit. Now it’s impossible. He literally laughs in your face and will continue to do whatever he’s doing to test you and laughs the whole time, which as I’m sure you can imagine, gets incredibly frustrating.

My husband works from home but only helps when it’s convenient for him aka whenever he feels like it. He has time to do what he wants but can only help when it suits him. That’s a whole other thing and I’m just generally frustrated right now. My husband has been working at the kitchen table all morning and the house is an open floor plan in the front meaning the kitchen, dining room, and living room are essentially one giant room. 

Anyway, for an example. My son and I were playing with playdoh and had moved from the kitchen table to the coffee table in the living room. He had started playing by himself and going between his tablet (which was on the couch) and the play doh so I backed off and sat down right behind him and started playing Animal Crossing but was still interacting with him here and there. The coffee table had a bunch of his other toys on there and he shoved an armful off to make room. This has been an ongoing issue (him basically bulldozing all his toys off the table to make room) and we have tried correcting it with no success. I raised my voice and sternly told him we do NOT treat our toys this way and asked him to pick them up, which as usual was ignored. I didn’t immediately jump to start picking them up myself and trying to get him to help me because that doesn’t work either. My son then started “testing his boundaries” by acting like he was going to swipe more toys off the table and grinning at me, waiting for a reaction. I chose not to react and ignore him because reacting doesn’t work. He did it anyway. I ignored the second time, but the third time when he dumped a whole container of expensive Brio toys I got pissed. I raised my voice again and told him we don’t throw our toys, picked up all the Brio stuff and put it away. I’ve tried telling him if he can’t treat his stuff nice he can’t play with it, but that doesn’t seem to work either. While cleaning it up I tried sitting him on the couch for a time out which he also thought was a game and kept laughing trying to get up. By now I’m extremely frustrated so I grabbed his arms and sat him back down and held his arms so he couldn’t get back up, got to his level, and sternly told him I had enough and he needed to stop and start listening to mommy.
My husband then decided this was a good time to intervene and started asking if I needed a break and said something about putting our son in his crib for a time out. I snapped at him and said that we can’t put him in his crib for a time out because he we can’t associate that negatively or it’ll be a disaster.
My husband then sat down and tried asking him why he’s not listening to mommy and he has to be nice and whatever which gets frustrating because 1) he’s asking him stuff that my son can’t answer because he doesn’t understand and 2) talking nice to him isn’t working. being reasonable isn’t working, we’ve tried that for months now.

I get toddlers are toddlers and aren’t going to listen and times are going to be tough but I can’t continue just “trying to be reasonable” because it’s not working and I’m not going to have a toddler running my household. I’m not a fan of spanking but this is the second time I’ve been very close to spanking him. 

One of the main issues I have is that my son smiles and laughs at any attempt to discipline him. He thinks it’s funny and will keep trying to do whatever it is he’s not supposed to be doing. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’m a SAHM so my job literally all day (besides college, I’m a full time student which I do at night) is to play with my kid. He gets plenty of attention between me and my husband both being home, plus my dad and brother are currently staying with us while they get adjusted to the new city they moved to and find work/a place to stay. He gets plenty of attention.

I’m at a loss. The only time disciplining him seemed to work was the one time I got down at his level and really yelled at him, which I’ve done once but then I feel horrible about making him cry because that’s not the type of parent I want to be. He did listen and we didn’t have any more issues, but again...it’s like is this really what it takes to get him to listen?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, especially if you’ve been in a similar situation.",1,"How to discipline when your toddler is too smart? I don’t know what else to do.

Toddler holding it all day at daycare. We have a new baby. Any tips?,"We have two boys: 2 year 9 mos and 6 weeks. Before baby brother arrived, we had been working on potty training our two year old.

How to socialize my toddler during a Covid second wave?,"Hi all, 

My partner and I are getting slightly concerned a put the amount of social stimulus our toddler is getting outside of us. We recently moved to a city where we don’t know anyone and things are started to shut down again as the second wave picks up.

She’s 14 months old, so the first lockdown was manageable as she wasn’t super interested in other babies then. But now she’s at the age where she’ll need to start developing those social skills. I feel like we’re in a tough spot. Pre-pandemic my partner would take her to mom and baby gatherings at the library or meet up with some friends of ours who also had little ones. However both those options are off the table now.

Any thoughts?

Is Mr. Potato Head safe for an almost 2 year old?,"My nephew is 21 months old and I was thinking about ordering a Mr. Potato Head for him.

Three year old with an emotional food obsession.,"Our three year old seems to have a food obsession. 

Not only does she eat very quickly and stuffs her mouth when eating, despite constant redirection and reminders not to (which could be considered fairly normal toddler behavior), but more worryingly, she associates food/hunger with any strong emotion she has, specifically if she is bored or upset but also if she is happy. She is comforted by food and highly enthusiastic about it. 

She has had meltdowns over food and cannot stop herself from asking repeatedly for food whenever she goes to someone’s house, including having meltdowns over food at other peoples houses when we intervene. Because others don’t understand the extent of her food obsession she is often offered food we would prefer she doesn’t have (candy, junky snacks) because other kids are eating it and our concerns are brushed off by other parents as silly and overbearing. For example, recently, we gave her a fruit for snack before arriving somewhere and then she was offered cookies by our host - it is difficult to say no when everyone else has cookies and we look like monster parents for not allowing her to partake( we do allow her a small portion in those instances but afterward she obsessed over it and asks for cookies repeatedly when feeling emotional). 

We are doing our best to model eating slowly and naming her emotions when she claims to be hungry and is clearly upset/bored/etc. We have found that saying yes to something sometimes decreases her interest in it, even so that she sometimes forgets asking for it, but it has not resolved her behavior by any means. If we gave her all the food she asked for she would be highly obese. She still says she is hungry and cries for food on average 3-4 times between meals and asks for food immediately upon waking. She is not fat per se (she looks normal and takes the appropriate size clothing for her age -3T - but her BMI is elevated at approx 18%) as we only give her healthy foods and highly limit her snacking options, so even though we have addressed the problem with her doctor, he was not particularly worried. 

We also noticed that when she was home from school (where food is provided) during quarantine, her weight for her height became normal, and when she returned to school she gained weight again to go back into the “overweight” BMI category. 

More concerning however is her obsessive behavior around food. Any strategies for helping her become less obsessed would be appreciated.

I feel like the only person in the world with a very small/petite child.,"My son will be 3 in December and as of twenty minutes ago, he’s only 2’9” and 27 pounds (12.25kg?). He’s. So. SMALL. and he’s been small his whole life, except for when he was a newborn and was a normal, kinda big size. But he just grew very slow after he was born and his doctor never saw a problem. He’s always below the 5th percentile for both categories. I’m grateful that he’s healthy but I’m always worried that there’s some underlying issue that his pediatrician hasn’t recognized. 


He’s almost 3 years old and barely fitting into 2T clothes. My niece is a year younger than him and his height.  People always guess he’s about a year younger than he actually is. I don’t know why strangers always have to play a guessing game about my childrens’ ages but it’s a thing, apparently. 


His dad is very tall and I’m average height. All the males in both of our families are over 6 feet tall. Why is my supposed-to-be-tall toddler so little?! His 4 month old sister is considered above average for weight and height and I just don’t understand what’s going on with my son. It’s really makes me feel  bad sometimes, like I’ve somehow malnourished him and now he’s small for life. He’s also a super picky eater so I feel like I’ll never be able to feed him foods/supplements that encourage growth or healthy weight gain. Like those pediasure “shakes” or whatever. He hates it all because life can’t ever be easy.

I lost it and slapped my toddler.,"I’ve been struggling lately. Between my husband traveling for work and COVID I’ve been a full time stay at home mom with zero breaks for like.. 8 months. I love my son so much but he is very active and doesn’t nap anymore and is, of course, a toddler. He’s 2.5. Very strong willed and quick to tantrum. The past month he’s started hitting and kicking me. I have to be honest it makes me feel shitty. I try to be a good parent and we go for lots of walks, hikes, play in the backyard, I play games and puzzles with him, read to him every day, and try to help him feel like he gets to make his own decisions by giving him lots of choices/freedom. He always has tasty healthy food and I keep the house pretty tidy. I try to create a happy environment where we sing and dance and smile a lot. But lately the instant I’m firm about a boundary (which I always give a warning first) he lashes out at me and screams “hit!” Or “kick!” While hitting or kicking me. I’ve gotten good at dodging or gently restraining him. I’ve tried ignoring, validating, and explaining other ways to express “big feelings” but he is attempting to hit/kick me like 10x per day now. 

I had to carry our monthly dog food subscription down to the basement so I did just that, except my toddler started following me down the stairs. Our basement isn’t finished or anything and toddler was in the middle of lunch so I explained that we were going upstairs and he tried to hit me.

I'm the best mommy EVER!,"Yesterday I took a sick day from work to spend with my 3 y/o.  He was super excited.  He slept through the night in his own bed which NEVER happens.  He comes in my room at 6:30 AM to sweetly ask ""Mommy can I watch your phone until it's morning outside?"" to which I respond ""Sure."" after looking at my watch.  He responds with an excited ""You're the best mommy EVER!  I LOVE YOU!""

I was just a puddle on the ground.  He is usually pretty shy about saying I love you (thanks to his dramastically shy 9 y/o step brother) and doesn't freely hand out compliments often.  I hopped right up out of bed.  We made muffins for breakfast then went to a farm with a petting zoo, hayrides, pumpkins and a badass playground (masked up of course) since it was 10 AM on a Tuesday and wouldn't be too crowded.

Thumb sucking,"I have a 4 year old who loves his thumb. He told us he wanted to quit sucking it AND stop wearing night time pullups when he turned 4. Pullups went fine but thumb....not so much.

But right now if he's at home and not wearing nipit he has his thumb in his mouth a LOT.

We tried drawing a smiley face on his thumb. Turns out washable marker doesn't stay washable so the smiley on his nail doesn't come off in his mouth.

No More Naps,"So, recently - maybe a month ago - I canceled my 2.5yo's nap. He wouldn't go to sleep at a reasonable time, no matter what I did. Without a nap, he's out around 9pm. Well, my husband works 12 hour shifts 3 days one week and 4 days the next. On his days off, he always lets me sleep in and then he grabs a nap later and he would take little man in with him. I kept telling him naps have to stop cuz I can't keep staying up til midnight or 1am! We also have a 4 month old. I'm getting worn out. We'll, he finally decided to listen and it's been fine for the last couple of weeks.


Until today. I slept in hard core. Until noon. Baby is teething so she'd had a rough night. I got up and little man was passed out on the couch with daddy. I guess he'd just climbed up, snuggled daddy, and passed out. Well, I figured maybe baby girl's rough night had affected his sleep and he was just tired. A little nap couldn't hurt, right? And it was super early. 


How wrong I was. He finally fell asleep just before midnight. And the whole time, I had to keep sending him back to bed while rocking and singing to a fussy baby who just wouldn't settle for anything. 12:30am and she's asleep, too. And now I'm starving but I can't get her to lie down. She cries as soon as I try. And Friday is grocery day so all the quick and easy snacks are gone. I need to learn to cook with one hand while holding a sleeping baby, I guess. 


I don't really know what the point of this was. Maybe hoping someone could relate? Husband works tomorrow. He has 4 days of 12 hour shifts. I may end up begging MIL to take the toddler for an afternoon this weekend so I can take a nap just to get through it.

19 month old is preferring signing over talking,"To start, I’m going to call his pediatrician for a speech eval or how to get into contact with PA early intervention - i’ve called the last two days with no answer so I might have the wrong number, but has anyone else experienced this? 

He only says about 5 words confidently and correctly and often, 5 words randomly ( including mama and dada), and about 6 words i haven’t heard as of lately.

Can toddlers hurt themselves when they scream?,"Kind of an unimportant filler/fluff question but I'm just curious.

My 3yo sister is throwing a tantrum as I'm writing this post and I was just wondering, can kids hurt themselves when they scream?

I've been practicing metal screaming recently and that made me think about how bad it'd be for my vocal folds if I'd scream for 30 minutes straight like that. Do kids have like a safeguard in their body that makes them invulnerable to damage from screaming or what's the deal :D? Doesn't it hurt them? Why do kids never sound like they've been smoking 2 packs a day after throwing a tantrum? Is it actually comparable to metal screaming in terms of what part they use when they scream (do they use their false cords for example) or what exactly is the reason they don't seem to ever f up their voice or throat when screaming?

Thanks!",1,"Can toddlers hurt themselves when they scream? Kind of an unimportant filler/fluff question but I'm just curious.

Tell me im not being high maintenance 😩,"At my 2 year olds, 2 year well check in August, his Dr told us if his eating habits didn't approve to make an appointment with a speech/occupational therapist. Okay cool, I assumed that was our green light. It's now October, decided to go with it. I find a place with good reviews and takes our insurance, and try and set something up. But they need a formal referral from the pediatrician. Thats fine, I call his Dr back, and the girl looks at his chart, mentions that the Dr had made a note that she told me to go to a specialist, but says she will have to get formal authorization from the Dr before she can actually send something to the therapy place, but that I might have to come back in for an appointment to get the actual referral. 

At this point I'm confused but whatever, they're going to talk to her and call me back. That was a week and half ago. I've called 3 times, to check in, and everytime they say the Dr hasn't checked her messages yet. But....they are all in the same freaking office together. The therapy place I called had limited spots available, so I'm anxious to get this started. Had I known this was going to be dragged out I would have started the process weeks ago, but based off what the Dr told me in person, she never indicated needing to come back. I just feel like I'm getting the run around at this point. 

Im trying to keep my cool, and not burn bridges, and drag this out even longer. But every time I talk to the girl that organizes referrals, she sounds completely annoyed with me, and I feel like I'm just trying to advocate for my kid and get shit done. Am I being completely high maintenance in all this???

My son pushes all his toys to the limit until they are broken.,"How would you deal with this?

My 3-year-old (June bday) son always seems to keep trying new things with his toys until they are eventually broken. All of them. We have tried a lot of different things and can’t really decide what the best course of action is.

For example, for his birthday he got a cool new robot. It is really durable, rated for ages 3+ with activities very much appropriate for my son’s age level. We worked with him a lot at first on how to enjoy the various things the robot could do and he took very good care of it for several months. Then he got bored. I’m sure you can relate.

Now at this point is when I try to stash toys for awhile and then bring them out later for renewed interest. But the robot was special and my son wanted to know where he was, so we got him back out. That’s when the experiments began. The robot shoots discs - will he shoot string cheese? Can he roll in the grass? Should we stuff things in his mouth to see if they fit? We explained all along the way that the robot was not made to do those things. We do stick to an indoor-toy and outdoor-toy system, but the robot would sneak outside or into bed or whatever. Eventually the robot broke and now will only give an error message when he turns on.

My son is confused. Although many toys have broken (and we thank those toys and throw them away), he still does this with each new toy and then is horribly disappointed that they break. And also, I don’t want to buy anymore robots! 

So, do we refuse to buy another robot until he is older? And when should we try again? Do we take toys away when he can’t play nicely, teaching him those rules, or do we let him learn from his own mistakes by letting him keep breaking the toys? What do you do/have you done?

14mo Old Boy Still Not Sleeping Through The Night! Help!,"Hey all, my wife and I feel like we've tried everything at this point. Our 14 month old has still not had an uninterrupted night of sleep and consistently wakes up nearly every 2 hours through the night still.

**His current scheduled is** 

* **wake around 9am**
* **nap 1 around 12pm (1 to 2 hours)**
* **nap 2 around 3:30pm (1 to 2 hours)**
* **bedtime around 7:30pm to 8:30pm**

His current bedtime routine is bedtime stories / winding with his favorite blanket with the lights low, once he starts to get sleepy we'll put him in his crib and he falls asleep almost always immediately.

Then around 2 to 3 hours later he'll wake up crying, want to be picked up / soothed (or sometimes try and nurse if he's very upset) and then go back to sleep. This continues through the entire night every 2 hours (Some nights every hour which are horrible sleep deprived nights for mom and dad) until his wake time.

We've tried different nap schedules, 1 nap days, different bedtime routines and different approaches to handling him when he cries at night. The only thing we haven't tried extensively is just letting him cry himself back to sleep at night - we've tried this once or twice but he just seems to get angrier and angrier over the course of as long as an hour before we decide to go in and sooth.

He FINALLY said “bye bye”,"Tonight, I was pushing our younger son on the swing and my husband brought me something to drink.  As my husband was walking away, our son said “bye bye” to him CLEAR AS DAY.  It was so awesome.  He repeated it 3 times.

Advice Needed: Almost 4yo Potty Regression,"I originally posted this in r/beyondthebump and it was suggested to me to post it here. (And honestly I don't know why I didn't know about this place before. I guess it's hard to believe my kid is growing up!)

Anyways, I'm looking for advice on potty regressions. My daughter is almost 4. Other than at night, she has essentially been potty trained for about a year. We had one regression this past spring with full blown pee accidents and slight pee accidents (enough to get her underwear and pants wet but not enough to have a puddle on the floor). However, I can sort of understand that regression because the changes covid brought as well as a new brother in the house.

Now, for the past 2-3 weeks she has been having a lot of both poop and pee accidents. Especially this last week she has had multiple accidents in a day. We have implemented a ""no snack"" in the evening rule when she has the first accident and more recently a ""no evening TV time"" when she has a second accident in the day. When it has been poop accidents I started having her clean out her underwear but that didn't phase her. The last poop accident I was fed up and just threw her underwear out. She wasn't happy about that but I still don't know if that will phase her. I've tried talking to her about it and asking her why she is having accidents and the best I get is ""I don't know."" The really frustrating thing is when I think I see her doing the potty dance and I ask her if she needs to go. She says no and I leave it because I couldn't be sure if it was the potty dance. And then within the minute she has an accident. 

I'm trying to think if there is any big changes but nothing comes to mind. Her new brother is almost 8 months old. But I am wondering if this could be an attention thing revolving around him. Also, she started pre-K at the beginning of August. It is at the same daycare/school she has been at all along and the accidents didn't start until at least 1.5 months after she started her new class. So I can't imagine it having to do with her school. And she hasn't been having accidents while at school, but I'm honestly not sure if they have a potty schedule still or not. If not then essentially she is purposefully only having accidents when she is not at school. 

I really just don't know what to do anymore.

Stealing new baby’s pacifier regression,"Hi all! 

Quick question.

I have a 22 month old and a 5 week old.  My 22 mo weaned herself off of soothers when she was 6 months old. Never really cared for them. 

Now that we have this new baby, she has been relatively good about the whole thing. I knew she would regress in one form or another.  She doesn’t talk yet (whole other battle) and this passed week she has been obsessed with her little sister’s pacifiers.  Mostly when we are just in the house.  When we are out and about she doesn’t seem to notice.

This is becoming a pain because she will constantly try to steal the baby’s, even when she has one in her mouth already.  If we take any soothers away she will lose her noodle.  

I’m scared her teeth will get bent out of joint or she will be hooked on these suckers.  Any advice? Just wait it out? I do my very best to balance both of the girls and she gets a lot of our attention.

"Small Human Questions, please help","So I recently started babysitting my great nieces (14 months and 3.5 years) because my niece is having a rough time, but I have very little experience with small humans. Please forgive some of the stupid questions.
3.5 is my buddy and we've had a great bond from day one, but I'm not quite as close with the 14 mo. Feeling guilty about that and also 3.5 is used to having my undivided attention when I visit but now that they're with me all the time  both are super needy and I don't feel like I'm meeting 3.5s need for attention/love/snuggles because 14mo insists on being held 24/7 and it kills my spine to carry both of them. If I put the baby down (even for 5 minutes to put clothes in to wash or do a tiny bit of dishes) she will fuss and if I let her fuss for a minute it turns into full blown screaming and she intentionally faceplants hard enough that it has to hurt. Is this normal for her age? Will it eventually go away? (Partially this is teething but also she's clingy af even when not teething, and she won't let anyone hold her but me or her mother)
3.5 is pottytrained for during the day but she refuses to potty alone and pretends she needs help even though she normally goes alone at her moms house. Why? Also when should she be able to stop wearing a diaper at night?
Also she insists on calling me mom and we've argued about it for days and she does understand that I'm not mom but she just. Wont. Stop. How do I fix that?
Also how well should 3.5 be talking? She did speech therapy for a while and she's been improving while here but I feel like she should make more sense than what she does. And how much should they weigh? They wear the same size of clothing (2T) but I feel like 3.5 is undersized but probably I'm just being paranoid.
My niece and her husband recently separated and he hasn't had much to do with the little ones since then, what do I tell 3.5 when she asks about him? Sometimes she whispers gibberish in my ear and then ""mama go byebye, daddy go byebye"" and I don't know what to say to her. It happens usually between 1-5 times a day.
How do I get 3.5 to eat?! She's incredibly picky and has realized that I'm a sucker and all she'll eat for me are hot dogs, apples, blueberries, and waffles. I tried baby protein shakes and she hates them.
What should the baby be eating and drinking? She eats everything except oatmeal and I have trouble with how much is too much, plus when her sister refuses food she'll eat that as well as her own. Also her mother said to give her fat free milk so she doesn't get chunky, but I read that they're not supposed to have fat free until after age 3. Can I give both of them toddler formula? 3.5 can't have real milk anyway because it makes her sick.
Working on teaching the baby to sit in a chair at the table in a booster seat and she hates it, is there any way to make that easier?
Any magical tricks to making them sleep at bedtime? 3.5 has an ipad and she's used to staying up on it very late, but while she's here I hide it and she doesn't usually ask for it. Even without the ipad she's still pretty reluctant to sleep and usually falls asleep after the adults do. Rocking and snuggling her does not do the trick. The last couple of nights we put on a movie at 8 and slowly decrease the volume and screen brightness until it's over, but still we fell asleep before she did.

My son is 17m, and he didn't start to walk until just a few weeks ago (FTR: He is a freakin' giant -- 99th percentile for height; my wonderful pediatrician warned me to ignore the usual timeline, as everything from rolling over to walking would likely take my son much longer than most babies). 

I'm not saying that keeping children in diapers too long is what causes the ABDL ""kink"", but it made me want to get this F-ing going.

How “normal” is it to be completely unable to have a phone call with your toddler around?,"I am currently staying at home with my 8yo and 2yo but I am on the job hunt. I just got contacted about doing a phone interview and they asked my availability for that. I told them the timeframes I could do, which is any time during my 2yo’s nap, and after my husband gets home. Then I figured I’d tell them that if those times don’t work, I could make something else work, and I thought about asking my MIL to come sit with the toddler while I’m on the phone. 

Then I started thinking about it and it seems kind of ridiculous. I feel like I should be able to sit her in front of the tv or whatever, and have her be totally cool for the time I’m on the phone. Right? But I can’t. I have visions of her screaming and banging on the door while I’m being interviewed. She still bangs on the door and sticks her hand underneath while I’m using the bathroom.

I told them the timeframes I could do, which is any time during my 2yo’s nap, and after my husband gets home. Then I figured I’d tell them that if those times don’t work, I could make something else work, and I thought about asking my MIL to come sit with the toddler while I’m on the phone.   Then I started thinking about it and it seems kind of ridiculous. I feel like I should be able to sit her in front of the tv or whatever, and have her be totally cool for the time I’m on the phone. Right? But I can’t. I have visions of her screaming and banging on the door while I’m being interviewed. She still bangs on the door and sticks her hand underneath while I’m using the bathroom.

Toddler teeth are weird,"Our son (part of a twin package) is 2.5 and quite the bouncy baby boy. Running always. Jumping now. And falling spectacularly. One such fall was into the corner of our house. I couldn't even tell you how. I didn't witness this one. And it broke two of his teeth. 

For two weeks he has been smiling like a 6 yr old in a 2 yr old body with 2 missing teeth. We finally got to the pediatric dentist today to see if reconstruction should happen. And lo and behold they didn't break off, they got pushed in. What?

I didn't even think that was an option. Apparently that's an option. So. Yay?

A huge mess at the grocery store,"Y’all I need to vent.

Last night we were outside and got eaten up, so I went into sprouts to try to get some bug bite relief. while we were there, we walk past the aisle that had all of the smoothie pouches. Of course my 20mo immediately started screaming that she wanted one. To be fair, we haven’t had breakfast or anything, so I figured I’d go ahead and get her one real quick, she can eat that while we are at the store, and everything will be peaceful, right?

Cue to the checkout lane. She’s screaming and upset that I won’t open pouch right now to hand it to her to eat. The lady at the checkout is understanding, hands me back the pouch, we moved out of the way. For whatever reason, an older grandpa (worker) decides to come up to her (she’s scared of men), to see what’s going on. she’s upset, borderline throwing a fit, and he proceeds to ask ““oh, did you not get the ice cream you wanted?“ 

Wtf!?! She’s now SCREAMING. I try to walk us outside, try to calm her and feed her the pouch when ANOTHER man walks up to us, and says another similar remark. She’s holding the pouch - which is open - and squeezes the pouch in one of those frustrated scream/outbursts. The smoothie shoots out and is now all over. 

Y’all. I’m done. I’m so done with today. I’m covered in smoothie. She’s covered in smoothie. And can someone please explain why these older men want to come up to us and make stupid “oh you didn’t get a cookie?” “Awe!! No ice cream?” Comments? She’s obviously throwing a fit. She’s in that age range where she’s scared of men (which I don’t expect them to know, but TONS of littles are). There were plenty of women there - they carried on with what they were doing.

My eat-everything-toddler suddenly became picky,"I have 2 kiddos a 6yr old and a 26 month old. 

Ever since we started our little guy on solids, he’s loved eating. And once his teeth started coming in, there was no stopping him... he would even steal things off of the rest of the family’s plates if we let him roam around after we thought he was done eating. He was never picky. And always had a great appetite. This lasted a glorious 1.5 years from about 6 months to about 24 months. This was great because we only had to deal with one picky eater, the 6-year-old (but she’d always been pretty picky, so nothing new there.) Then everything changed. 

Starting at around 24 months, he started rejecting food he would usually inhale. (Oddly enough, around the same time, the 6-yr-old started eating a little bit more). But the pasta with homemade meat sauce that was always an easy dinner for both kids became a struggle for him to eat even 1 or 2 pieces of macaroni. He spits everything out and says “all done!”  I’m worried about him not getting enough to eat, or a large enough variety of foods. He only voluntarily eats eggs, cheese, bread, rice, corn, and fruits. Almost everything else is a struggle. I try not to cave in to giving him those foods all the time, because i know it will develop terrible eating habits.

how to get a 2 year old to stop the temper tantrums?,"hello! so i babysit twin toddlers, both 2. one of them has a serious issue with emotional regulation &amp; separation anxiety, so she will cry whenever her parents walk by or leave (it doesn’t help that her mother works from home &amp; dad works from home 2 days out of the week, so the kid will cry anytime a parent is in the vicinity). the problem is, the crying just doesn’t stop. she will scream &amp; cry for hours, nothing i do helps. if i even come near her, it just makes things worse &amp; she screams even more. i’ve resorted to putting her in her high chair to stop her from climbing the locked gate for their play area &amp; hurting herself when it’s an angry tantrum. distractions with toys don’t work, she just gets more upset; sometimes the tv helps, but she’ll just stop crying for a moment &amp; then start up again. all this crying makes the other twin start crying too because she doesn’t like loud noises, &amp; then i’m struggling to get the both of them to calm down.

i know the crying isn’t pain related or because of a need. she will make a sign when she’s hungry to ask for food &amp; you can usually tell when it’s pain related; but 95% of the time, it’s literally just crying for attention. i can’t reason with her that mom &amp; dad can’t do everything because they have lives, as she doesn’t have the language to fully understand yet. her parents get stressed because they can’t get work done with all the crying.

Bed time,"Hi guys! Relatively new here, and English is my third language, so bear with me here.

My 2.5 year old has been a dream to put to bed at night since she was around 14 months. All we had to do is walk her in, say good night, kisses and walk out. No crying, no whining, she'd fall asleep in a matter of minutes.

Now, however, something has changed. She'll cry unless we sit there until she falls asleep. I try to stay strong, but she's a stubborn little princess. She'll scream and cry for up to an hour, but if we choose to sit down from the very start, she'll fall asleep in a couple of minutes just like before.

It started during the summer when we spent some nights at my family, but it hasn't occurred at home until last week.

This wouldn't be a huge problem and it's hopefully just a fase, but I'm worried it's gonna last as I am 5 months pregnant with number two.

Has anyone experienced the same thing?",1,"Bed time Hi guys! Relatively new here, and English is my third language, so bear with me here.

Best masks for toddlers?,"My son is 20 months old and is starting to pay attention to the fact that I wear a mask when we go out on our walks.

Spicy Screwdriver,"Tonight I went out to get ice cream as a treat for our family. When I returned home I found my son (3) red-faced screaming in pain holding his hand over his mouth, and my husband frantically trying to identify the problem. There was no blood, no sign of injury,  but it was clear that something was wrong.

Earlier in the evening a friend had dropped off a bucket of habanero peppers. It had been placed on the kitchen counter,  but was now in the middle of the living room. So, naturally my husband and I assumed that our son had attempted to eat one. However, when we could get him calm enough to answer questions he was adamant that he had not eaten a pepper. He kept stating ""I ate my screwdriver, it hurts really bad"". (And would then resume weeping)

With that information, and the fact that there were no half eaten peppers, nor any sign of chewed pepper in his mouth, we then moved on to the assumption that he had poked his mouth  (specifically the area behind his upper lip, because that's where he was pointing and crying) with his toy screwdriver. My husband located the toy screwdriver, shoved it behind his lip, asking him ""is this what you did?"".

It was at that moment that my husband realized what had happened, as his mouth was now on fire too. Our son then admitted to poking the habaneros with the screwdriver and then putting it into his mouth.

Potty Training Help,"I’ll try to keep this brief. Our daughter 3 (in 4 weeks) is basically potty trained. We started at the end of May. 

Our problem is pooping. She deliberately was pooping every time she got in our pool. After weeks of this we began to remove her from the pool clean her up and not let her get back into the pool. After four times of not being allowed back in the pool she started getting out to go poop because she wanted to get back in the pool. 

Her new place to poop is always on the playground at daycare or her play set in our backyard. It’s gotten so bad daycare puts her in a pull up to go on the playground. I’ve asked them to remove her from playing outside when she poops. One teacher from another class called me a monster. 

The problem is she knows when she has to poop and she’s deliberately doing it on the playground. 

So my question is am I being to harsh? I don’t know what to do anymore. It worked for the pool (not allowing her to go back after pooping in it that is) and got her to stop pooping in the pool and tell us she had to go poop.",1,Potty Training Help I’ll try to keep this brief.

“That child should be in a high chair”,"My MIL has no idea the trouble we have had getting our toddler to eat, since the day he was born and almost landed in the nicu for his blood sugar, continuing through a horrible breast feeding experience and going through five different medical professionals until my infant’s tongue and lip ties were diagnosed — long after I had returned the rental pump and thrown in the towel on BF. My MIL has no idea how many formulas we tried and how stressful it was as the frozen milk supply dwindled and little dude rejected every single kind sold in our city. She had very little sympathy for any of the eating struggles we had the first year. Like most of the doctors, she dismissed my concerns about his weight. After he got his tongue tie fixed, he ate SO MUCH that his weight percentile went up from &lt;10th to 50th percentile. 

His early weight struggles meant he had limited energy for tummy time. We had to take him to baby PT and he still ended up having to wear a helmet for 3 months, which MIL was super judgy about. 

Never mind the “triple feeding” regimen that made the postpartum period miserable for me personally. 

We have gone into the toddler food battles very much embracing “whatever works” and focused on building a positive relationship with food over a particular menu or table manners. 

So when my MIL feels compelled to make some off hand judgmental comment about what we are feeding him or how, I want to reach through whatsapp and wreck her.

Offered to watch my cousin's daughter who is a terrorist. What activities should I plan?,"So my niece and daughter are 4 and only a couple months apart.

No child is perfect, no child loves to share, and I have come to expect this because I have a 4 year old lol.

However my niece is the type that purposely does things to make other kids upset. It seems that she enjoys it very much.

Example: yesterday she asked my daughter if she wanted to play with the ball she was holding. My daughter said sure, and I thought ""how sweet she is sharing."" A minute later my daughter asks for the ball and she said nope its hers. So I asked her why she offered for my daughter to even play with it if she wasn't going to give it to her, she said ""cause I wanted fight with her and not give it to her."" 

My daughter wasn't even interested in the ball till she said anything.

She asked me to get off a swing as she was done. She then notices a random child going towards a different swing and she runs over and tries to knock the kid over to get on the swing before her.

My friends sweet little 2 year old was trying to bring a chair over to sit next to me, my niece goes over and tries to rip it out of her hands so she can take it. She almost smashed this chair in this poor girls face.

More often than not my niece pulls this when her mom isn't around. In the past when myself or even my mom were watching her and have had to reprimand her (firm talking to, taking a break from playing etc), as soon as my cousin comes to pick her up or gets back from wherever she instantly starts bawling and trying to make herself be a victim. 

Like I have never witnessed a child like this.

My cousin as a child was similar in her behavior, but not as bad and I literally had nothing to do with her until we were young adults. It was easier because I was 6 years older. 

Our girls are the same age and do have good times but I have had to greatly reduce their time spent together because my daughter was starting to pick up her bad habits.

My cousin needs a sitter tomorrow so I offered. She would do it for me.

I'm trying to think of activities I can do with both of them that will not result in her trying to intentionally make my daughter mad and then retaliate.

That’s not the end of the world but the issue is now she is waking up almost every night in complete hysterics screaming to go to the lounge and the only thing that calms her is relenting and getting up with her and watching a film then eventually she will drop asleep in the sofa (she can be awake for up to 4/5 hours). We’ve tried calming her, letting her cry out a bit, lying next to her. Giving her a hug. Reading stories etc but we’re all out of ideas and can’t be getting up every night. It’s not good for any of us. She has a routine of bed, bath, calm play and then stories every night

Did anyone else go through this? And how did they get over it?

Tldr: toddler waking up hysterically in middle of night and only way to calm her is to get up and go to the lounge. Any advice for 2 tired parents?

Night terrors in 1 year old?,"Has anyone had a 1 year old experience night terrors? Most of what I read says it's a thing between 3-12 years old though I did come across a [JAMA study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2337224) that found the most common age is 1.5 years so I don't really know.

Our child started getting what I think are night terrors around 12 mos and now it seems to be getting more often around 17 mos. 

But with a child this age it's kind of hard to tell. He screams like crazy and can't be calmed down. It usually lasts about half an hour but sometimes even longer and it usually happens in the first few hours of the night. His eyes are open and he looks awake. He often sits up in his crib or lays down and kicks a lot while wailing. Any ideas?",1,Night terrors in year old? Has anyone had a year old experience night terrors?

2yo peeing outside out of nowhere!,"Ever have your toddler pee outside out of nowhere? My 2yo stepdaughter did just that today...out of nowhere.

We reinforced that she needs to use the potty when she has to go and that when it’s so close, to make sure to use the toilet. 

Would y’all think this is a learned behavior? Something she had to have seen someone else do or someone else told her about/to do.

Pls tell me I’m not the only one?,"14 month old son has always been a good sleeper. From day one we’ve established a good nighttime routine which I think has helped tremendously. Part of that routine is he gets a bottle in bed (*GASP) when we put him down. We’ve recently switched from bottles to sippy cup and it’s been working just fine. Usually give him a watered down sippy cup of milk (around 6 oz). I know this is 100% against “the rules” but it’s just worked for us (husband and I) and given us the most amount of sleep, which is especially important since we both also have full time jobs. 

Lately he’s been waking up around 4am screaming which is very unusual. Not sure if it’s nightmares or teething (or combo of both), but after 45 mins+ of screaming we cave and go into his room to change him and give him another 4-6oz of watered down milk. He goes back to bed within minutes. 

Questions:
- Has anyone else dealt this this or do this? All of my mama/parent friends said they’ve NEVER given a bottle in bed. Kind of a shitty feeling and makes me feel like we’re not doing a good job

Need tips for parenting a newborn &amp; delayed 20m old,"It's hard to say my 20m old is difficult because he has an extremely sweet disposition, but he is speech delayed (basically non-verbal but babbly) and I think it's finally starting to frustrate him. He usually keeps himself busy rolling cars around and playing with figurines but since I brought the baby home he has been reckless with his toys and fussier than usual. Yesterday when people were over looking at the baby, he kept spinning in circles and throwing his toys around uncharacteristically. Since he is significantly speech delayed, I had him developmentally evaluated open to the possibility he might have autism or something, but the way he interacted with the evaluators was attentive and calm and they concluded he had no significant delays. I feel like he needs structured, 1-on-1 education to learn and now with the baby I'm scared I won't be able to give that to him and his delays might snowball. He doesn't listen when it's important, only when he's calm and engaged. I'm just really not sure what to do now that the baby needs all my attention (SAHM of 2).",1,"Need tips for parenting a newborn &amp; delayed 20m old It's hard to say my 20m old is difficult because he has an extremely sweet disposition, but he is speech delayed (basically non-verbal but babbly) and I think it's finally starting to frustrate him.

She thanks me in her own way,"So my 2 year old has been sick. When she gets sick, she gets extremely fussy and, for some reason, seems to be into everything the past couple of days. We’ve had rough nights the past couple of days. She’s been so much worse at night, and she was waking up every hour just inconsolable because she wasn’t feeling good. I worried about her being sick, then worried about finding the medicine the pediatrician told me about. Just a lot of worry, stress, and very little sleep the past couple of days. 

Last night, after shower, I was going to lay her on the bed to get dressed to go to sleep. She grabs me so tight, hugs me close, and says “I love you, mommy.” We hugged for a while, while I told her “I love you too, baby,” she replied, “I love you more.” Then, I  cried.

Being a mom is not easy. We worry about our children. Being a mom has been one of the hardest and most beautiful things I have ever done. At times, it can feel thankless.

She won't sleep??,"My 2 year old has slept MAYBE 4 of the last 32 hours. She (so, we) woke up at 3:50am yesterday (after very interrupted sleep so even that was maybe half a night sleep). She went back to sleep for less than an hour before being up for the day. 

Since then she hasn't napped, and didn't fall asleep until 8pm yesterday. She was asleep for two hours at the most, probably less, before waking up.

She refused to sleep until 2am this morning, and then I'm not 100% sure she was asleep. Every time I checked on her she was wiggling around. We gave up at 5am and started the day.

Here it is, noon, and she is so tired she can't stop screaming. Nothing I'm doing helps. I'm alone at home with no car and no options.

I've tried: 

Leaving her alone

Holding her hand

Laying on top of her

Playing music

Playing nature sounds

Tylenol

Gas medicine

Cool/Warm cloth on the forehead

Singing lullabies

Singing 90s tunes

Offering every single toy

Bottles

Juice

A snack in bed

Talking to her over the monitor

Switching out blankets

Sleeping somewhere else, like our bed or the couch

Patting her

Burping her

Carrying her 40 pounds around and rocking her

And so much more. I'm at a loss!! At what point do I need to call the doctor? Is there a point where it becomes necessary? Any tips you think I haven't tried? I'm worried for her, she's absolutely miserable. Shes been crying for hours because she is just SO TIRED.

I haven’t slept uninterrupted for 3 years! My toddler’s sleep is horrific. HELP ME.,"Let me start by saying, I have a now 9yo who was sleep trained at six months and sleeps like a rock. 

We were late to attempting to sleep train my now 3yo because he has never been on the growth chart and was too tiny for sooooo long. (He’s still only 23 lbs.) 

I’ve periodically tried sleep training over the last two years (allll the kinds) but never with much success. 

We recently tidied up his bedtime to be earlier (7:30-8), and shorter. Shower, then snack time in the kitchen, three books then two minutes singing while he’s in bed then a kiss goodnight and he stays in bed... is the goal anyway. We also added a tiny bit of melatonin. 

He’s been doing pretty good with that, although we are sliding back into him getting rocked to sleep or mostly to sleep. 

The middle of the night is a total nightmare though. He wakes me up around 12:30 am to put him back to sleep and then again around 4. Then he sleeps until 5:30 or 6 at the latest. (Older brother usually wakes up too early at 5:30 and wakes us all up moving around.) 

On worse nights he could be up every 1.5-2 hours. 

That’s literally a way to torture someone, and it’s been going on for three years. I’m exhausted, no energy, and very very grouchy. 

We have a gate but it hasn’t worked well and we don’t use it. 

I’d like to enjoy life again and not be a tired irritable lump, if anyone has any ideas.",1,"I haven’t slept uninterrupted for years! My toddler’s sleep is horrific. HELP ME.

New Toy was a Flop?,"I just bought my 18 month old one of the Snuggle Buddies from Generation Mindful.  They're the people who make the time-in toolkits.  Snuggle Buddies are stuffies that have four little strings attached to a small plush shape that tucks into a pouch at the back.  You can use these little shapes to teach your little one to name and communicate their fillings because they are each different colors.

I was SO excited to get this yesterday.  My little girl is very verbal and she already started repeating the colors and emotions attached.  I think emotional intelligence is super important so I felt like I was winning as a mom.

I pulled it out just now to show my husband and we barely got through the first emotion. He immediately said he doesn't like associating colors with emotions.  I was flabbergasted.  My response was a less than graceful ""seriously??"".  But honestly it had never occurred to me that THAT would be a problem.  The conversation quickly devolved into some past resentment, so I'm not even sure why it's a real issue.  I'll try to approach it again later.

I'm looking for some perspective.  Does anyone else have a problem with teaching a toddler to associate colors with certain emotions? Why might that be a bad thing?",1,"New Toy was a Flop?

How do you teach your toddler to share? My concept of sharing seems to be different than those around me.,"I have a daughter who recently just turned 2. She’s always surrounded by cousins and playmates almost the same age as her. Some older cousins seem to take advantage of her being younger and can’t run as fast so they just take whatever toy she’s holding when they want it. 

When they’re at home visiting, of course all toys at home belongs to my daughter, they still do the same. So I told them “no, you can’t have this at the moment as she is playing with it. You can ask if she can share her toys and you should also accept when she says no.” This was in front of my husband (who is the one related to the cousins as I don’t have a family or friends of my own here in Germany) and my in-laws heard this as well. 

They always tell my daughter to share, which is totally fine of course, but maybe treat her as you would treat a normal person and respect her decisions when she says no? Especially when it’s her toys. Because in my opinion, if you force her to share her toys not only do you disregard her feelings, you also teach the other kids to just get it because “sharing is caring” and they don’t learn how to move on when they are told no. 

My daughter is 2 and can already understand. I ask if she can share with me her food or toys NICELY all the time. I say thank you when she does and I say ok when she doesn’t want to share. I think it’s about respect. She’s a kid but doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve it. 

Also, when it is us visiting her cousins, it’s the same. When they don’t want to share, I tell my daughter to find other toys to play with. She cries, yes, but she’s gonna learn that it’s not hers and if the owner doesn’t want her to borrow it she can’t. 

Am I doing the Right thing here? The parents of these children don’t seem to do it like I do. How do you handle this?

"A developmental milestone (2yo), and a broken heart.","I have sung the same three songs to my daughter since she could kick in the womb. Carta Para Maria, Gracias A La Vida, and Arrivera. Those songs mean so much to me in regards to her. Every hard night for either of us, any pain, any sorrow. I would sing. Sometimes even for the hell of it. And this morning, I sang Gracias A La Vida. She got out of her chair, touched my chest, and said “No. Stop it, now.”

Well, life has been hard this past while. So I stopped singing, and let tears roll down my cheeks. Not loud ones. But I just let them fall.

Refuses to wear glasses,"Our 19 month old is pretty farsighted and his pediatrician is adamant that he wears glasses. We’ve been trying for a while and he *will not wear them.* The moment we put glasses on him, we have to physically restrain him, and he will cry and cry.

This morning we put them on for 5 minutes and just held his hands and tried to distract him (TV, peek-a-boo). Nonstop crying. 

I feel like this is the only way - but worry that we are going to traumatize him or something. So? Are we going to scar our son by physically restraining him? The hope is he will eventually understand  he can see better with them on.

Nighttime wakings,"I've been battling bedtime with my youngest child for about 4 months now.  She will be 2 this month.  She used to be a dream, toss her in a crib on a moments notice with a bottle and that was it.  Then one day it all changed and we've been struggling ever since.  I won't rehash here but we have tried literally everything (including a different bedroom) and here's where I need help because my regular moms groups haven't seen anything like it.    


If we cut naps completely, and only do quiet/rest times, she will go to bed at bedtime with a minimum of fuss.  She is asleep by 8 -9pm, or 9:30 at the latest.  (I can't tell you how long this has been a battle) and this has been consistent for over a week, so we're pumped.  (If there's a nap of any significant length, especially in the afternoon, she will battle us at bedtime until 11PM or later, then everything is thrown off for a couple days)   


Problem is, she will wake up around 5 nights a week between 1AM and 3AM, and will not be able to get back to sleep for a minimum of 3 hours.  Then she sleeps another 3-5 hours.    


Does anyone have any advice for a child that has difficulty going back to sleep?  Especially when she's clearly tired and will truly lay still or be rocked for hours upon hours.  I've tried milk, diaper changes, cycling her through quiet play, rocking, and laying with her, my partner and I trade off...nothing decreases the time below 3 hours for her to get back to sleep.

Toddler anxiety,"My son is 3 almost 4 and very bright. His dad and I just went through a separation 4 months (no drama, just very sudden). I live in a nice place while their dad stayed in their house. I have the kids 80% of the time.

He went through a little uncertainty at first, but adjusted well 2 for the most part.

But NOW?! Holy cow, he is terrified of me leaving the room and says he doesnt want me to leave him. He calls out for me about 2 minutes. I have to sit in the bathroom just to have him take a bath without driving me insane.

The other day he said ""I feel different."" when asked why he said, ""I'm worried about you"". He couldnt articulate why, but that makes me sad.

He is acting really uncharacteristically naughty lately too.

He sleeps with me and bedtime is a nightmare because he wont stop touching me.

Is it the Halloween stuff? He loves that stuff! Is it a delayed reaction to the separation?

I get they go through a stage like this I guess, but for how long? I reassure him CONSTANTLY that I love him so much and that hes safe and I would never leave him and I tell him all about the things I love about him.

This is driving me insane and hurting my heart and making me feel guilty all at the same time.

I don’t like my kid,"My just turned 2 year old daughter is a nightmare. I’m so tired of it. She’s relentless and I just don’t like her anymore. I love her of course, but I really don’t enjoy spending time with her anymore unless were cuddling watching tv. It’s the only time I feel like I’m having a nice time with her and enjoying her company.

She’s just fucking crazy. She has been way above average activity levels since before she was even born. She was walking and climbing around the time most kids her age were just starting to crawl. At baby classes, she would be literally running around the room while her peers sat nicely in their moms laps. She doesn’t stop. She loves to scream. All she ever wants to play and do are super physical activties. The first thing she says to me in the morning is “go outside?” 

She doesn’t listen even though she understands. She’s defiant. She thinks it’s funny to be bad. She will do the exact thing I tell her not to while *screaming* “DON’T [thing she’s doing]”  She’ll ask for a food, I’ll give it to her, and even though I know it’s something she likes, she’ll spit it out and say ew because she thinks it’s funny. She’s aggressive and violent. She pulls hair and kicks and thinks it’s funny to hit. When I make her say sorry she says it with the most shit eating grin you can imagine.

I always feel sorry for myself. I just want a normal child. Sometimes I feel so genuinely amazed and perplexed at people with two kids, all those people who around 1 or 1.5 decided they could grow their families an add another.. HOW?? Then I remember they have fucking normal children. 

I want a shy one. A reserved child. A quiet one. Man, I want to be that mom who has to push and encourage her child to try new things. I hate bringing mine to the park because she will find the highest, most dangerous, meant for much older kids equipment there and run up it immediately. I hate play dates because her behavior just embarrasses me. I spend the whole time apologizing and just wishing my child could be like the others. It’s not fair. I’ve spent her whole life trying to make peace with the child I’ve got and accept her as she is but it feels impossible. She’s so amazingly difficult and I hate it.",1,"I don’t like my kid My just turned year old daughter is a nightmare. I’m so tired of it. She’s relentless and I just don’t like her anymore.

Why I don’t take 3yr old to the grocery store.,"The grocery store has always been my son’s favourite place to say inappropriate shit to strangers. He likes to evaluate people’s food choices and tell them they’re “wow so healthy” or “you probably should put some of that back”. One time he told an overweight woman that she “probably doesn’t need more cupcakes, you can have a banana if you want a treat”. I don’t know where this comes from because I’ve never discussed the link to unhealthy food and being overweight with him and the topic only comes up in the grocery store. If he sees someone buying chicken or fish he yells, “hey!! Hey you!!! Did you know someone cut that fish/chicken’s head off?” He loves telling people about the head being cut off, he thinks they don’t know this and he’s genuinely providing them new and useful information. He is very social and will try to start conversations with everyone and anyone, about anything. Yesterday I was bagging my groceries while an elderly man was bagging next to us. Suddenly I hear, “HEY OLD MAN!” I turn around give some the look and say “stop”, but he does it again. Then he looks at me and shouts “THIS OLD GUY’s EARS ARE BROKEN LIKE GRANDMAS HE DOESN’t KNOW IM TALKING TO HIM”. I explain if he wants to talk to someone he should say excuse me first and ask their name, not call them things like “old man”.... “EXCUSE ME OLD MAN!

Son: “HI PETER, NICE TO MEET YOU TOO, DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY VERY OLD?”. I turned around and scolded my son, Peter thought I was scolding him (he obviously was pretty deaf), anyways it was extremely awkward.

Bedtime Existential Fears,"To preface, I've always joked with our 3 year old, telling him I'm making him worm cakes and that I'm giving him away to the circus. It's at the point where he'll laugh or will tell me he'll make me snake soup. We've also talked about serious things like death and getting hurt and as far as I can tell, he understands those fairly well.

He's been learning about the solar system at school and last night, his aunt told him that the sun will eventually be sucked in by a black hole or it will run out of gas, thus ending life on earth. This is fine, it's all real, we have been reading lots of planet/solar system books to him too. He nodded and we thought nothing more of it.

Come 10:19pm he came out of his room in TEARS telling me, ""mama I don't want the sun to be sucked into a black hole. I don't want the sun to run out of gas"" So of course I had to comfort him.

The easiest thing would have been to lie and told him that's not happening, but that's not our style so the real struggle began. I thought about telling him that it's not gonna happen in his lifetime but I didn't want tonight to be the night for him to have another existential fear about death even though we've talked about it before. It was hard to explain to him the concept of millions and millions of years b/c he thinks 100 is the largest number ever. 

After a while I settled on ""everything comes to an end someday, but the sun disappearing will happen far away in the future and for now, you are safe with mommy and daddy. I'm here for you"" and then I patted him to sleep. (I did stutter through most of it, so it's not nearly as smooth as I have it in my head, but it was enough to convince him)

Like, I think I did OK. Funny thing is all this time I've prepared myself for the social issues talks but completely forgot that there are a million other things that scare kids. It reminded me of when I was five and I accidentally put foot cream on my nose and my classmates told me the doctors will have to cut off my nose and it TERRIFIED me. I still remember the nightmare of being cut apart like a steamed egg (popular dish in China). And when I finally got the courage to ask my dad he completely blew me off. So 30 years later a small part of me still thinks my nose will get cut off.

Anyways, the end.

He's been learning about the solar system at school and last night, his aunt told him that the sun will eventually be sucked in by a black hole or it will run out of gas, thus ending life on earth. This is fine, it's all real, we have been reading lots of planet/solar system books to him too. He nodded and we thought nothing more of it.  Come 10:19pm he came out of his room in TEARS telling me, ""mama I don't want the sun to be sucked into a black hole. I don't want the sun to run out of gas"" So of course I had to comfort him.  The easiest thing would have been to lie and told him that's not happening, but that's not our style so the real struggle began. I thought about telling him that it's not gonna happen in his lifetime but I didn't want tonight to be the night for him to have another existential fear about death even though we've talked about it before. It was hard to explain to him the concept of millions and millions of years b/c he thinks is the largest number ever.   After a while I settled on ""everything comes to an end someday, but the sun disappearing will happen far away in the future and for now, you are safe with mommy and daddy. I'm here for you"" and then I patted him to sleep. (I did stutter through most of it, so it's not nearly as smooth as I have it in my head, but it was enough to convince him)  Like, I think I did OK. Funny thing is all this time I've prepared myself for the social issues talks but completely forgot that there are a million other things that scare kids. It reminded me of when I was five and I accidentally put foot cream on my nose and my classmates told me the doctors will have to cut off my nose and it TERRIFIED me. I still remember the nightmare of being cut apart like a steamed egg (popular dish in China). And when I finally got the courage to ask my dad he completely blew me off. So years later a small part of me still thinks my nose will get cut off.  Anyways, the end. I just wanted to share with other parents of little ones.",25,3,2348,464,

Need some meal/snack ideas that are calorie-dense,"My 3-yr old was born a bit preemie (5 lbs at birth), and is currently in the 10-15th percentile for weight (27 lbs), and about 50th for height. She seems....completely uninterested in food. She seems happy at seeing her favourite foods at mealtimes, but after a couple of bites, just....forgets to chew. Simply doesn't care. I'm afraid she is not getting the calories she needs to gain a bit of weight, she has been at the same weight for over 2 months. Her current schedule is:

Wake up around 7
7:30 small bowl of oatmeal with whole milk and some blueberries or currants 

10:00 banana

12 noon vegetable parantha or dosa with dal, some yogurt and bit more fruit

1-2 nap

3:30 2 palm-sized pancakes OR small bowl upma OR 3 potato fritters OR 1 dosa

5:30 small snack, usually dates, cashews, almonds etc. small handful

7:00 veggie khichdi, some more yogurt, sometimes a few slices apple

This is literally the most she will eat in a day. If I try to sneak in anything else, the next meal goes for a toss. Even if I add a dollop of butter to everything, it still wouldn't add up to 1000-something calories that are recommended. She doesn't drink any milk or juice.

Anyone use Mother Goose Time or a similar structured program?,"I am really struggling with what to do with my son (22 months) all day. I feel like we end up doing a lot of the same things and I know I am not giving him enough. I just cannot come up with enough ideas of what we should do all day.

Nursemaid elbow?,"Has anyone had experience with a toddler being diagnosed with nursemaid elbow? Daughter had a fall at daycare yesterday and was complaining of arm pains and wouldn’t move her arm after. We took her to urgent care last night. After x-rays didn’t show a break, the doctor believed it was nursemaid elbow. Which sounds like a slight dislocation in the bones or ligaments of the elbow. The doctor manipulated her arm and said she heard it “pop” back into place. Told us to take her home and keep her comfy overnight but that she should be back to normal the next day. 

Well, overnight was rough. A lot of crying and not a lot of sleeping. Today my daughter still says her arm hurts and she won’t move it. We made an appointment with her pediatrician at noon just to see if maybe she needs her arm readjusted again? 

But does anyone have experience with this? The articles we read and what urgent care said was that she should feel better and be getting back to normal by now.

At my wits end - advice gladly accepted!,"My son is 16mo, 15mo adjusted as he was 5 weeks early, seems like one issue after the other.
The infant phase was great. He sat up on his own pretty early and was on track with his milestones. He ate a mix of regular table foods and purees.

He did a complete 180 shortly after his first birthday. He hardly eats regular table foods except a select few. I feel like he's no longer meeting the important milestones. 

He doesn't gesture much, if at all. Puts his arms up when he wants up and that's it. No waving bye-bye, no pointing, no head shaking or nodding. He has 2 words, go and dada. The tantrums are unreal most days and he ignores my husband and I when speaking a lot. Fine motor skills are really bad.

3.5 yo keeps having accidents,"My 3.5 year old daughter was fully potty trained (except at night) until March and had a major regression during the beginnings of Covid-19. She started back at daycare in July and almost immediately went back to having no accidents. So clearly a routine was needed.

We've tried a reward chart which worked for a bit and then she seemed to stop caring. And now we are using a consequence chart (every accident gets an x, five x's and she loses a predetermined toy).

She also gets a special snack if she comes home from daycare with no accidents.

"14 month old night weaning, now struggles to eat at all","I’m a FTM to a 14 month old healthy and happy boy.

As of last week he still had a bottle of milk just before bedtime and two bottles at night. 

Two days ago we decided to drop the night feeds because of two reasons. 

First, he already has 13 teeth and I’ve read that nighttime bottle feeds can cause tooth decay.

And second, he really likes food, is open to try anything new and not picky, but eating not very much as he’s having more than 400 ml (14 oz) of milk at night, so there is no reason at all for him to increase the amount of food he eats.

Night weaning itself is working surprisingly well. First night he was whining and moaning for about 20 to 30 minutes at 4 am, after that slept till his normal wake up time.

Tonight he stirred and whined for 2 - 3 minutes a couple of times, but again slept till wake up time.

I’m very happy about this! But here is my problem.

Since yesterday he ate very little and refused to have breakfast altogether this morning. He just had half a piece of toast and very little of a fruit pouch as a snack before his first nap.

I’m very worried he isn’t eating enough but I don’t want to fall back on bottles.

Has anyone else gone through similar experiences? Any tips or tricks to get your child to eat?

Any recommendations or ideas are very welcome. Thanks in advance for your help.",1,"month old night weaning, now struggles to eat at all I’m a FTM to a month old healthy and happy boy.

My SIL potty trained my kids and I’m upset.,"My husband and I both unfortunately caught covid, by some miracle both our kids (DD 3.75, and DS 2.5) somehow didn’t. 

They went to stay with my husband brother and his wife. They have 4 kids (7,5,4,just about 2). We knew they patented very different than we do. We’re more into gentle parenting, and taking cues from our kids. She’s very structured and routine. But they love their kids. they were there for a little more than 3 weeks.

In that time my SIL took it upon herself to potty train both of them. We’ve been offering DD the potty often, but respect it when she says no, and DS is really quite young, so we never really thought of it for him yet. My SIL potty trained all her kids early, (all before their second birthday, which I personally think is really too young, but not my kids) 

Anyway, when we got our kids back, both were potty trained. (DD, day and night, DS, day only) I’m really upset. 

When I confronted her about it, she said DD, practically taught herself, and was really interested when her cousins went to the bathroom. And DS, she said she was already potty training her almost 2 year old, and they just did them together. And she had mentioned potty training on the phone (I assumed she just meant her own kid)

My husband said I should be thankful, instead of upset. But it feels like she forced my two very young children to grow up before they were ready. I really wanted it to be something they led the way in.

Am I’m being unreasonable? I just feel so upset.",1,"My SIL potty trained my kids and I’m upset.

We’ve been offering DD the potty often, but respect it when she says no, and DS is really quite young, so we never really thought of it for him yet. My SIL potty trained all her kids early, (all before their second birthday, which I personally think is really too young, but not my kids)   Anyway, when we got our kids back, both were potty trained. (DD, day and night, DS, day only) I’m really upset.   When I confronted her about it, she said DD, practically taught herself, and was really interested when her cousins went to the bathroom. And DS, she said she was already potty training her almost year old, and they just did them together. And she had mentioned potty training on the phone (I assumed she just meant her own kid)  My husband said I should be thankful, instead of upset. But it feels like she forced my two very young children to grow up before they were ready. I really wanted it to be something they led the way in.  Am I’m being unreasonable? I just feel so upset.",43,9,1497,279,Rant/vent
Searching the best tricks for how to make a toddler stop screaming,"My daughter (14 months) has a very loud voice. Already in the hospital after birth nurses joked and said ""she has powerful lungs"" as she screamed louder than any other child that we saw there.

Since then she has only further perfected her skills.

While some babies weep and give cute little sounds, for her it's nothing but the volume turned to 100%. And oh boy, she can scream well.  


&gt;The moment I turn hungry? **LET'S SCREAM AS LOUD AS I CAN**  
Wake up every 2h during the night (most nights)? **LET'S SCREAM AS LOUD AS I CAN**  
Something not quite how I want it? **MORE SCREAMING ON FULL VOLUME!**

Especially at night, the moment she wakes up she's able to right away produce an insanely loud scream. Then stands up and screams.

And when I bring her to bed after she wakes up (which can take quite long sometimes), she will scream as loud as possible until the moment she falls asleep. 

It's magical. :)",1,"Searching the best tricks for how to make a toddler stop screaming My daughter (months) has a very loud voice.

Harness recommendations please :),"TLDR: Toddler harness recommendations to buy. 

A bit of background to explain my son’s nature incase anyone is able to offer any advice if their kids are similar....

So as like most toddlers, my son is REALLY active. He is 21 months now. When he was younger, mostly when he first started walking (around 1 years old) I always said I probably wouldn’t need to use any kind of toddler harness as I vowed I would try to ‘teach’ him now to walk nicely next to me. I had visions of us strolling together down the road hand in hand calmly within the first few months of him learning to walk. This was very short lived or more that I had skipped a couple of years in my head past the 18month+ stage all the way to perhaps the 5 year old stage. Plus he is the kind of little boy who literally just runs EVERYWHERE without any cautiousness or care for anything! (A cousin of his around the same age is the complete opposite - he will wait for his mum or be cautious to go anywhere without her, I guess it’s just down to individual personality!)

In the past week he has become so difficult to walk with on the road or even in a shopping centre and also has started to throw tantrums if he’s trapped in his stroller for a period of time, mostly because he wants to get out and walk himself. He doesn’t EVER really walk and only runs, to the point where even a fast paced walk is not enough to keep up with him, I now have to jog. He’s also SO quick and I worry he will get himself into danger or hurt himself. He doesn’t want to hold my hand (he never really does!) and I’m actually quite terrified to do this anyway because he will pull the other way - a few months ago he had ‘pulled elbow’ (the nurse said he probably is more prone to getting it in future too and to be careful.) He doesn’t like to listen much to me/doesn’t yet have the understanding of danger/gets so distracted and excited by being able to walk free somewhere. I want him to experience walking and seeing the world on his own legs, but in safest way possible.

We were given one of those bags which has a harness attachment as a gift and have tried it, but it just isn’t cutting it. I really think I need a proper one, and probably one that is more supportive too and comfortable. I don’t entirely love the idea of using one while we are out BUT if it means to keeps him safe, then that’s more of a priority.

Help shifting 3 yo poop schedule,"3 yo poops in pullup's minutes after we put her down for the night. Sometimes multiple BM's over the course of 90 minutes.

What sort of car for tall parents of a toddler and a baby?,"We've just produced our second child, and I now find myself driving in my VW Golf with my knees up to my tits due to there being a child seat behind the driver's seat. I am pretty tall, and like to have my seat all the way back. If it matters, we're in the UK, so we generally favour smaller cars than in the US. Until now, I have been very happy with my Mk6 Golf.

What sort of car should we be looking at to get the necessary amount of space to be comfortable? In the UK, crossover SUVs  seem to be very popular, but when I look at them on the road they don't really look any bigger than my car, just taller. We don't want a huge SUV, but wouldn't rule out a medium-sized one if it would be big enough to be comfortable. It seems like estate cars (called station wagons in North America?) aren't really fashionable any more, but that they might be the answer. Would the estate version of Golf be long enough, or should we be looking at something like a Passat Estate? I'm just sticking to VW here for ease of comparison - I'm not brand loyal.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on how comfortable they find their cars with two child seats in them.

"Nearly 3 and I feel such a huge disconnect with my son, like he's more an animal than a person","My son is nearly 3, he is being raised bilingually and he just started preschool a week ago. He's only going a few hours a week right now. I dont know who else to talk to about this, I feel like my son is abnormally difficult.  He doesn't seem to understand much of what I say. He repeats words, but if anyone asks him questions he just repeats the last word they said. Like ""whats your favorite animal"" he'll reply ""animal"" 

Theres no way we can ever have a conversation, I cant ask him if he had fun at the park, or whatever. He has these books to learn words with prompting questions like, ""which toys do you think make noise?"" And he would never answer a question like that. 

Hes misbehaving a lot, throwing things at his sister, hitting pushing, etc. All these books are like, ""tell him x and blah blah"" and if i try to say something about him using gentle hands or making his sister feel better he'll just start saying tractor over and over or whatever. 

Its so incredibly frustrating because his behaviour is getting really nasty but all these gentle parenting methods seem to require a child who can actually communicate or at least understand what their parents are saying and he doesnt seem to understand at all.

Time outs and yelling obviously dont work either so its like im basically now just watching him hit throw run away break things etc and i feel completely helpless.

How does your toddler’s mask stay on for more than 4 seconds?,"Hi all, my 2 year 5 month old daughter doesn’t mind wearing things (hats, sunglasses, bows, what have you) and so I thought getting her to wear a mask would be relatively easy.

Transitioning back to daycare,"Hiya! Posting in hopes that some folks have gone through something similar before! My son was enrolled in daycare from around 4 months to 7 months, when he took him out of daycare due to Covid. He was in the infant room which was very tailored to each kids specific schedules for sleeping, eating, etc. Well, it looks like we are going to have to send him back sooner rather than later (as early as the end of this month). He is now 15 months and will be joining the 12-24 month old room, which is a lot more structured. I have a few concerns:

1. He is not walking yet- I'm wondering how the interactions with other kids will be when he is crawling and they are all walking?

2. He currently takes 2 naps (morning and afternoon) at home, but they will be on a 1 nap schedule. We have tried a 1 nap schedule at home and it has gone poorly.

3. The biggest thing I feel ashamed to admit - we still rock our son to sleep for his naps and for bed. He also sleeps in a sleepsack, in his dark room with a sound machine. Obviously the majority of this cannot be replicated at daycare.

I'm really worried how this transition is going to go, on top of the fact that he is going to be constantly sick again from being at daycare.",1,"Transitioning back to daycare Hiya!

Toddler won’t use potty outside of the house!,"I am really stuck with potty training and am hoping someone out there can give us the perfect piece of advice! For background, we started potty training our 22 month old a little over 2 weeks ago (mostly using the “Oh Crap!”method). The first 3-4 days were really tough (for me, mostly) but then it really started to click. Since he’s still pretty young, he needs help with his pants, but with our help he is using the potty successfully at home with few to no accidents, and he is able to hold it and stay dry for small outings to the park, grocery store, etc. 

So, the problem is he will NOT use the potty outside of the house. I’m impressed with how well he can hold it, but also worried. I’ve tried taking him in public restrooms a few times, and we always bring the potty in the car with us. I have him sit on it whenever we get somewhere and before we leave. I try to keep it low pressure and just give him the opportunity, but he never takes it. I once tried to make him stay on the potty until he peed- he sat there for a full 1/2 hour singing and talking about trains...no pee. Twice now he has had an accident in his car seat on the way home when we are out for too long (Today we were out for about 2 hours, offered the potty 3 times, and he peed AND pooped his pants in his car seat on the way home- about 10 minutes after he sat on his potty 😭).

Does anyone have any advice on how to break through this resistance and get him to use the potty outside the house?",1,"Toddler won’t use potty outside of the house!

Should I talk to his Pediatrician?,"Hi All, I'll try to keep this brief:

&amp;#x200B;

My 4 year old son (almost 5) had a stroke during labor. He technically has a diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. Much like adult stroke victims, he does not have any real mobility control of his left hand or left arm. He also has some issue with mobility with his left leg but to a much lesser extent. He had a brain scan done when he was about 1 years old when we found out the diagnosis. Pretty much all of the damage is on the left side of his brain, that controls movement. The language, emotions, and intellectual side of the brain was not damaged (this at least is how the doctors explained it to us). He has perfect verbal skills for his age and is actually very smart. He is social and loving with others and has many friends at school. He expresses emotions correctly. He is, by all accounts, a beautiful and friendly smart little boy. Most people have no idea there is anything wrong with him until they notice that he doesn't use his left arm. In school he is in regular K4 classes and does great. He goes to physical therapy and occupational therapy to try to help him use his arm more. He is also learning how to use things around his disabilities like how to do certain things one handed etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago though we noticed he has a problem. We got a switch and he is able to play it with the individual controller and his good hand. He loves Mario Party, Mario Kart, Kirby etc. I mean....he's obsessed. But we noticed he \*cannot\* for the life of him sit still while playing. He wiggles about, writhes, kicks his feet etc. He runs around all over the place almost frantically. The worst part is that he wants to be in your lap while you play together, but two seconds later he's back up again, then back in your lap, then back up again etc. He also claims ""I'm so cold!"" so you put him under the blanket on the sofa but two seconds later he's off the sofa again bouncing around but saying ""Mommy I'm cold! I need the blanket!"" and its like....you were under the blanket but you got out not even ten seconds later! When he is in your lap, he does these constant mico movements that are almost like repeated muscle contractions like he can't help but fidget. He also jumps on the sofa when you're playing games together. But its almost like compulsive because you will say ""Stop jumping"" and he will say ""Ok"" but not even five seconds later, he's jumping again. You say ""Didn't I say no jumping?"" and he will go ""OK mommy sorry"" and then not three seconds later he's jumping again. But its seriously like he doesn't even realize he's doing it, its just like a compulsive thing for him that he just does without even realizing he's doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing is that he often talks over my husband and I when we try to talk. I know thats normal toddler behavior but he just says the same things over and over again. And this is the other big part of that issue- ""Hey mommy. What can we do? Mommy. What can we do today. Hey mommy. Mommy. Hey Mommy."" ""WHAT?"" ""I love you"" ""He says some variation of this probably a thousand times a day.Hearing ""hey mommy"" is starting to make me want to rip my hair out. Because he rarely actually WANTS anything. ""Hey mommy, can I have a snack?"" is fine. ""Hey mommy can you help me go potty"" is fine. But it's always just ""Hey mommy.......hey mommy......"" and then some nonsense like ""What can we do"" or when he can tell I'm getting aggravated he switches to ""Hey mommy, I love you"" because he thinks I can't get mad if what he's saying is ""I love you"". My husband was on the computer last night and I was trying to watch TV while he was watching videos on his iPad. Absentmindedly he said ""Hey mommy, what can we do"" and I said ""Well you're watching videos and then its time for bed"" about one minute later he said ""Hey mommy......mommy.....mommy.....what can we do....."" and I said ""I just said after videos we can go to bed"".....not even a minute later ""Hey mommy...."" to which I snapped and shouted ""WHAT????"" because I had been hearing it for hours at this point. He said ""Mommy....I love you"" which of course made me feel like a jerk for snapping at him. I said ""I love you too buddy"". NOT EVEN TWO MINUTES LATER he goes ""Hey mommy..........I love you......"" like he hadn't just said that. My husband came around from the computer room and was like ""I can hear you just repeating yourself for no reason other than to bother mommy!""

&amp;#x200B;

Its driving me up a wall and I'm wondering if this is normal toddler behavior? The thing is, we are always on the look out for signs that he might have any special needs mentally because its a possibility that this can happen as he gets older. The other thing is that these behaviors feel like compulsions. Its like.....he has to say something, even if its nothing at all, he has to says something just to say something but its not just regular toddler chatter because its just the same handful of things over and over (usually, what can we do, or I love you, but always prefaced with the drawn out 'hey mommy' first).

Big tears when getting in trouble,"Lately my 2.5 yo daughter as been having these big reactions to being told no or scolded. I don’t think we are being overly mean, but her reactions are making me think twice. She will instantly tear up with big tears and start crying like she’s hurt. And to be clear right off the bat, we aren’t touching her or yelling during these interactions. 

Here’s an example: 
Last night she is sitting with me at our high top kitchen table. Now, I hate this table because she’s so wiggly and about falls off every time we sit there. But it’s the older table of our two and takes toddler abuse better than our dining room table. We have tried talking to her about sitting still and that she could get hurt, but you know, toddlers don’t care. So she’s sitting there being all wiggly and about falls off but catches herself last minute. She was obviously caught off guard and I told her in a stern voice to be careful and sit still. I probably shouldn’t have been stern, but I had already asked 10 times and she was NOT listening. She instantly starts tearing up and crying. But crocodile tears that just kept flowing. 

Is this normal? I don’t know why lately this is her response. I know she’s testing boundaries but her reactions seem disproportionate with how we are correcting her. Should we be changing our response for correcting her? When we ask nicely or try to make it a choice, she just smiles slyly and keeps doing what she wants to do. I wouldn’t mind dealing with this once in a while but lately it’s any time we have to correct her or ask her to stop doing something dangerous. Like falling off chairs, trying to touch the stove, etc.

1 year old night wakings,"I need advice. Please no judgement just advice. My 1 year old sleeps between me and my husband. He wakes up every single night crying.

I Couldn't Be More Proud,"So, yesterday, my back f'd up. Tonight, DH had to take baby girl (4 months) from me and laid her on the couch - toddler (2.5) fell asleep on the couch cuz his grandma and aunt watched him til DH got off work (cuz of my back) and didn't have him nap. Anyway, back is steadily getting worse and DH had to help me to the bathroom. There's the slightly relevant backstory.


So, when DH laid baby girl down, toddler half woke up and shifted himself so he had his arm around her and was snuggling her. I'm just so proud of him. He's the most amazing big brother. He loves her so much and he does his best to help take care of her. I breastfeed and he'll pull my shirt down and shove my boob in her mouth. He's always wanting to hold her. I pump and give her a bottle a day so she'll be used to them and take them in case the pandemic ever lets up and we can go on a date or something and he's always wanting to give her the bottle. He changes her diapers. It takes forever, but he does an excellent job.

Sleep problems,"Tl;Dr - I cant get my 3 year old to stay in bed or fall asleep within a reasonable amount of time and I feel like ive tried everything. 

I am having so much trouble with my 3 year old and sleep. He sleeps through the night just fine, but getting him to sleep is the problem. Most nights it takes him 1-1.5 hours to fall asleep. I heard it should only take 20-30 min for a toddler to fall asleep and I dont know what to do to help with that. I feel like ive tried everything and if something does help, it only works for a week or so and then he struggles to fall asleep again. The only way I've really gotten him to fall asleep without any problems is if he's up until 11-12am (which is way to long for him to be up especially with no naps).

We tried switching him to a real bed and he would never stay in bed and thats when it usually took the longest to fall asleep - some nights it would take 3 hours to get him to sleep and the only way he would stay in bed is if someone was in there with him, which was fine but I didn't want to make a habit of it bc I was pregnant and didn't know how that would work with a newborn. I know transitioning him takes time but even after 7-8 months it never seems to get any easier.

We switched him back to a crib shortly before the baby was born bc nothing seemed to help. That obviously kept him in bed, but he still has trouble falling asleep. I feel like somewhat of a failure bc he should be in a real bed by now but I just cant keep up with putting him back to bed for hours and trying to put the baby down.

Now that the baby is easier to get to sleep and sleeping longer, I feel its time to try and switch him to a real bed again but I just don't know what to do. He's also said a few times he wanted to sleep in the big bed vs his crib so idk maybe now he's ready? He doesn't take naps anymore bc he wont fall asleep and if he does it makes bedtime even harder bc he seems to have so much more energy. We tried multiple different routines but they never seem to last, like no TV 3 hours before bed, no sweets before bed, no electronics before bed, etc. We tried this bubble bath and lotion that had lavender, chamomile and melatonin in it. I've tried diffusing lavender and chamomile oils in his room and putting it on his pillow. Right now the routine we are doing is a bath shortly after dinner and then get dressed/brush teeth and then stories and then bed..he never seems scared in his room just seems like he can't fall asleep and I also feel bad just leaving him up there for hours to fall asleep.

I'm not sure what to try anymore, one thing I noticed is if he's in bed by 7pm he falls asleep pretty quick compared to normal. But then after a few days or so he was waking up around 4am, sometimes 2. Im not sure if i should start trying to give him naps again, idk if he's just overtired and fighting it. Im not sure if I just have to keep sticking to the same routine even after he goes back to having trouble falling asleep, maybe after a few weeks it will start to get better/shorter? Im not sure anymore how to help him bc I feel like I've tried it all. It just seems to make it hard on him when he's falling asleep late but waking somewhat early (early compared to the time he fell asleep) and then refusing to nap and then also refusing to sleep. I feel like its not good health wise at his age to be up that long but idk how to help him.",1,"Sleep problems Tl;Dr - I cant get my year old to stay in bed or fall asleep within a reasonable amount of time and I feel like ive tried everything.

Vacation help? “I want to go home”,"This is the second vacation we’ve taken with my 2yo (nearly 3 year old) this summer. First trip went perfectly. LO slept in a twin bed for the first time no problem. Seriously did great. Loved all the different things in the house. Very few tantrums and overall we all had a great time. 

So...we book another trip only longer this time. I figured, everything went so great last time let’s book a full week. We’re in the same area but a different house because of reasons. When we first get here, LO is very happy. Loves the house, toys, special dinner, special movie after dinner, flamingo themed room to sleep in. However, come bedtime...MAJOR meltdown. And not the angry kind but the kind where they are sad and scared and it just breaks your heart. LO wants to go home to sleep in their own room.  “I want to go home please” 😢Does not like the bunk beds and is now being driven around in the car until sleep prevails. We have 5 more nights plus God willing naps!  We have favorite stuffy and blanket from home but doesn’t help at all. 

To make matters worse, the kid won’t sleep in our bed. Like if kid comes into bed all 3 of us would be up all night. If one parent goes into kids bed, there is no sleep.

I need opinions,"My son just turned 2 but I’m already thinking about preschool. 

We have a very nice Montessori school (k3-8) that’s walkable from our house, the only issue is that it’s highly sought after and everyone is accepted via lottery. The only way to avoid the lottery is by having an older sibling in the school or by signing up for their toddler program. 

The toddler program is for 2.5-3 year olds (so he would be starting next September). It’s 3 hours/day and it’s $800.00 month.  

The issue: this year feels like a wasted year because of covid. I had envisioned us going to play groups, music classes, library classes, gymnastics... all things we used to do precocious and now can’t do because of the virus. I feel cheated because I won’t be able to do any of those classes if he enrolls in the toddler program next year (they are all morning weekday classes). 

What would you do? Should I keep him home another year so we can do all these mom and me classes and try to get him in through the 3k lottery in the 22-23 school year? Or should I sign him up for the toddler class next year (21-22 school year) so I know he’ll have a spot. I already applied to the program and need to accept by Nov 1 to guarantee him a spot in the toddler program.

Second Guessing Starting Preschool,"My son, 3, just started back at preschool last week. He will only be going 2 days a week. Classes are cut in half. Teachers wears masks. Kids it’s optional. So far, he’s gone one day, and is already sick 😬 AFTER ONE DAY. He was in school last year until March and was sick off and on constantly, which I expected. But of course, with covid, now I’m concerned I may have made the wrong decision sending him back already. I knew he’d get sick but not this fast! 

I understand it’s an inherited risk sending him back, but I’m trying to weigh both his and my mental health as well (I had to stop working to take care of him for the past 6 months the we quarantined). He has been desperate to be around other kids again (as I’m sure all kids are at this point). He’s an only child and has taken to mostly terrorizing our cat. But his dad and I need to work (we own our own business). We’ve gotten busier and my husband needs help. And I WANT to work. I am not the type that can do the SAHM thing full time. I’ve been doing it for 3 years and I need the mental stimulation of work. 

I had him with a nanny for the past month, but she could only give him so much of what he needs socially. Plus she works at a restaurant and is young, so who knows what she’s up to. I don’t feel like having her come is a particularly lower risk of exposure. 

Plus my son was so happy when I picked him up last week from school. Like beaming from ear to ear. But shit! It’s like I can’t win. Send him back, possibly get covid. Don’t send him back, he’s semi miserable as am I. 

I tried to form a “pod” and it was a logistic nightmare. Finding a teacher was imposible too. They all wanted like 70-80/hour for 3-4 kids and full time jobs. So that fell apart quickly. Plus getting the parents on the same page was impossible. I wasted a month of time trying to make it happen. 

Finally found this preschool. Maybe I just need to make him wear a mask at school? I know some kids are and some are not. 

On top of this, and I know I’m going to get flak for this, I have a compromised immune system (Crohn’s disease), so apparently I’m higher risk? I guess. I haven’t had a flare in 6 years because I follow a strict diet and have been super healthy since. But I wonder how my body would and could deal with covid if I got it. Who knows.

"So, I grew up with “BLIPPI”...weird &amp; interesting experiences because of it?! But, at least my son thinks it’s cool! RANDOM Sunday afternoon storytime!","*Apologies: 
1. On mobile so I apologize for the format. 
2. My first post
2. TDLR; I am closely connected with “Blippi” but the person, &amp; I have gotten hate for it, fake people who have tried to use my close connection, my son is going to be in a few new videos &amp; I am creeped out I have my friends merchandise, especially the doll of my childhood friend! 

 
So I truly did grow-up with “Blippi”, &amp; closely, not just acquaintances! I am not only from the same town in central WA, but he is actually a great friend of mine! He was a grade below me, &amp; was one of my brothers best friends, and his sister (his only sibling) was a grade ahead of me! She was a good friend, but we drifted apart due to different social paths, but we remained and are good! He actually had a HUGE crush on me! I have love letters from him, and in my yearbooks he used to purposely make my brother mad by telling me in detail why he liked me! His loves letters are also VERY FUNNY! He was always funny, and he was always wanting to make people laugh, but he was also made fun of by older peers...who is laughing now as their kids are all addicted to his show, &amp; are forced to line his pockets with his merchandise! I’m literally SURPRISED that nobody has once sold him out by a large media outlet for money! We have that type of hometown (I literally know of 3 peers who went on Dr. Phil-1 was a made up story) as they are also the people who literally have maybe only gone to Seattle (maybe 90 minutes away) a handful of times and think it’s some HUGE, and crazy big city?! It’s not, luckily I have a parent who has always lived there so I was exposed to more than my peers! I have also lived downtown for years now, &amp; it’s kinda a small place. But due to the things known it’s actually weird as I just thought of it while I am writing this! 

So he’s changed his name spelling, and he has made his life and history, ESPECIALLY in regards to his family to protect them. I personally know why and this has brought me into some of the most bizarre situations, 90% online! This WHY I could see someone to sell something to the media for money...sad. 

I am in A LOT of mom groups online! Especially larger ones, &amp; the bigger groups are all connected to one main group, I don’t want to say the name of the main group, but it’s got like 30+ sub-groups. Whenever I mention it, which I only admitted it once in one of the more drama base groups (they each are on a drama spectrum; and some have men too). 
Ugh... I got INTERROGATED more than I have about other things that are actually a lot more interesting or could be accused of being unreal! Most people who had CLEARLY done some serious digging into him to know things most people who aren’t even in the same age bracket for our hometown to know?! Most were all cool but I got hated on too. Especially when I didn’t discuss details of his family. Which I won’t now either, and I know why he has gone to a lot of effort to hide his family!  Wow I showed an email exchange and I had blocked his more personal info out but enough to know I wasn’t lying it was FINALLY all doubters were cool about, and I of course had some random haters for me just knowing someone &amp; proved it was real! 

I have more than the contact information that proved us to be close, that’s way more personal information which I won’t share. He did thank me privately in another separate exchange via text as I was explaining the story initially, &amp; he was like,
“Yeah...sorry [insert my name] those are probably the same moms that send me nudes, videos and mail me panties! They even mention their kids names asking me for stuff or just are horny bored moms!” 
So when he sent me back an email kinda taking a shot at the moms who cyberstalk him, including the mean hater moms (the most) it was kinda justice! This was awhile ago &amp; I NEVER thought it would follow me online? 

I have since had people who either remember that stupid thread, or followed haters online for a bit, and then I will get like 1-2 random random moms PM’ing from all over asking me if it’s true I am “the girl from [Insert Mom Groups Name(s)] that is friends with Blippi?” And ask if I can get free stuff, his info, a sad story of why their child’s life would change by him personally doing SOMETHING, and then the other moms who want to be in a video. Those video request ones, they ALWAYS seem to know before he has a video setup to film pretty far ahead, I have no idea how? Which is almost always then met with “my child is so much better than yours to be in one!” Ummm, RUDE! Plus he hasn’t been able to do one yet?! He’s literally asked me about it because my brother, who was so close to him, well he passed away their senior year, and my son happens to look IDENTICAL to him! Which my brother I’m referring to as I have more than one (5 total) often were assumed to be twins! But still, I can’t believe that 1 random comment from over a year ago has caused me to get my child hated on and they typically have somehow found me on IG which I am SUPER careful with privacy stuff on social media due to my sons father &amp; having a protective order for my son and I. 

My son was gifted a doll of “Blippi” (Stephen lol) after I FINALLY gave in to him knowing about him, and he is also very aware that I actually do know him, but he has not yet realized he’s not actually the character in real life! I’m going to soon shatter his sense of innocence by him doing a video and getting to hang out with him in the near future! BACK TO THE DOLL.... I have found myself hiding him because I am CREEPED out by my childhood friends voice coming out of this doll that kinda looks like a guy I know! -Best way to explain it! 

Before I get any hate, or people who go after me and try to or maybe succeed in my identity, just know I am not going to say anything about his family life. I will gladly answer questions about it. I’m NOT trying to brag I promise! I promise you, it’s just SUPER weird, and I can’t believe sharing it almost a year ago has followed me?",1,"So, I grew up with “BLIPPI”...weird &amp; interesting experiences because of it?! But, at least my son thinks it’s cool! RANDOM Sunday afternoon storytime! *Apologies:  1. On mobile so I apologize for the format.  2. My first post 2. TDLR; I am closely connected with “Blippi” but the person, &amp; I have gotten hate for it, fake people who have tried to use my close connection, my son is going to be in a few new videos &amp; I am creeped out I have my friends merchandise, especially the doll of my childhood friend!     So I truly did grow-up with “Blippi”, &amp; closely, not just acquaintances! I am not only from the same town in central WA, but he is actually a great friend of mine! He was a grade below me, &amp; was one of my brothers best friends, and his sister (his only sibling) was a grade ahead of me! She was a good friend, but we drifted apart due to different social paths, but we remained and are good! He actually had a HUGE crush on me! I have love letters from him, and in my yearbooks he used to purposely make my brother mad by telling me in detail why he liked me! His loves letters are also VERY FUNNY! He was always funny, and he was always wanting to make people laugh, but he was also made fun of by older peers...who is laughing now as their kids are all addicted to his show, &amp; are forced to line his pockets with his merchandise! I’m literally SURPRISED that nobody has once sold him out by a large media outlet for money! We have that type of hometown (I literally know of peers who went on Dr. Phil-was a made up story) as they are also the people who literally have maybe only gone to Seattle (maybe minutes away) a handful of times and think it’s some HUGE, and crazy big city?! It’s not, luckily I have a parent who has always lived there so I was exposed to more than my peers! I have also lived downtown for years now, &amp; it’s kinda a small place. But due to the things known it’s actually weird as I just thought of it while I am writing this!   So he’s changed his name spelling, and he has made his life and history, ESPECIALLY in regards to his family to protect them. I personally know why and this has brought me into some of the most bizarre situations, 90% online! This WHY I could see someone to sell something to the media for money...sad.   I am in A LOT of mom groups online! Especially larger ones, &amp; the bigger groups are all connected to one main group, I don’t want to say the name of the main group, but it’s got like 30+ sub-groups. Whenever I mention it, which I only admitted it once in one of the more drama base groups (they each are on a drama spectrum; and some have men too).  Ugh...

Isochronic Tones with Brown Noise,"I am curious if anyone knows about the use of isochronic tones for children? Like to help them sleep? It seems to help my little boy a whole heck of a lot, but honestly I was extremely sleep deprived when it occurred to me to try it, and, thinking on it now, the tones won’t hinder his brain development in any way, right? I don’t see how they could, but I’m not a scientist. Please no judgment, just curious about what everyone thinks about this.  I’ve done a little searching online but can’t find any articles specifically pertaining to children.

**Some background: my son is 17 months old. I suspect he might have ADD like me (though who knows rn. But, genetics, so I’m mindful) He would probably stay up all night if we let him... a night owl with boundless energy. As for me, I literally cannot sleep without an eye mask and binaural beats in my earbuds. As a young child, I was an insomniac too, a common problem for people with ADHD (my parents still speak of the “years they went without sleep”) Anyway, now that my boy has this white (well, “brown”) noise playing in the background at night, when he wakes up, after midnight usually, my partner just gives him a bottle in his crib, not even picking him up. The boy drinks it, throwing it away when he’s done. Falls back asleep. Magical. He even slept through the night once last week (!!) So, I can see it’s working fairly well BUT it goes without saying, if it’s hurting him in the long run, it’s not worth it. Not to mention, I can just play the brown noise setting without the isochronic tones underneath it. I’m sure it would still help... 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Tl;dr ;; are isochronic tones safe for babies to listen to while they sleep at night? 

If he is getting more sleep than he was before, I feel it’s probably benefitting him not harming him. Any insight from other parents is extremely appreciated.

FYI I use the AmbiSci100P app that’s available on the App Store, &amp; the Sleep-Deep HP/SPK setting with Brown Noise, if anyone feels their child would benefit (or even yourself) There are tons of free apps like that one available on both stores. I just hook my phone’s bluetooth to the Echo, but I’m sure any speaker would be fine.",1,"Isochronic Tones with Brown Noise I am curious if anyone knows about the use of isochronic tones for children?

Son freaks out when give him a cup,"My son is a pretty normal 2-year-old (27m) in most ways. The one big hang up we have right now is he never really stopped drinking out of a small bottle.

Straws, no straws, those round lids that help them learn how a real cup works, some with little nipple-like nozzles, etc, etc. It hasn’t been a huge priority because he’s not in daycare yet (would be, but covid). Today we decided to draw the line. Told him the bottles were gone and his milk is in a cup from now on. He has been screaming for 4 hours. Refusing to drink anything. I can tell he’s thirsty and getting dehydrated. What the heck am I supposed to do? This is on the verge of panic attack. He knows where the milk is, and knows how to drink it.

Toddlers and masks,We are having to send our 3 year old back to preschool after pulling him out due to covid.

The problem is they make them wear masks inside and out and the thought of my three year old having to wear a mask all day for the whole week makes me so sad.

Should I pick a school I like a lot less that wouldn’t make them wear masks?

"Our 17 month old has insane food anxiety/jealousy, and it's driving me nuts","Hey gang, I'll get right to it: as he's moved on from purees, our son has become a monster in all ways related to food. He is never satisfied with a meal no matter how much he eats. And he cannot *stand* the thought of someone else eating food or food existing that he isn't eating. This really can't be exaggerated: if we leave a window open and a stiff wind rustles a bag of chips in the next room he will have a complete meltdown. It sounds like I'm exaggerating, but no. No.

Our older daughter didn't have this issue - she would sit in her highchair and entertain herself after eating a meal, and she wasn't desperate for literally all food she could see. I'm really at a loss for how to deal with this. It means we can't ever really eat at non-baby times unless he's napping. Doing some version of ""cry it out"" where we try to distract him or encourage him to build up his resolve doesn't work either.

Has anyone dealt with this?

Potty training problems,"My daughter is approaching two and a half. Potty training has been an battle for all of us. My wife and I, have our daughter sleep in training pants, we periodically after her if she needs to per throughout the day, and she usually tells us when she is about to, or needs to go. Nonetheless, she’s doing pretty well. However, we’ve ran into a slight problem..... she’s been really holding her #1 and #2 excessively. She holds it even when she is wearing a diaper. She will start dancing and say “pee, toilet” and we rush to the bathroom for her to only dribble, and trickle. We put on a diaper or training pants and she does the same thing. The other night, she randomly woke up (she’s usually a great sleeper throughout the night) and was fidgety and kept moving around and couldn’t get comfortable. It’s unlikely of her to wake up in the middle of the night. We think it’s because she had to go, but was holding it in.

1 year old hits and bites,"My son is my everything so I'm afraid I've done something wrong which can be either spoiling him and not knowing how to set boundaries. 

I don't mind distracting him when he has a tantrum because I won't carry him to the pop figure area, or just letting him scream it out when I put him down and stop carrying him. But he's always been a biter and recently he's started hitting. Especially when he doesn't get what he wants by also just in general. 

Examples. Today he started getting fussy because I sat down with him on the couch instead of standing with him. He started crying and ""slapped""(failed his arm) at me. He also started hitting his father's head for fun. Then later he was sitting next to the dog petting her, this is new, so I said ""good job! Good gentle!"" To which he giggled and then hit her.

But he's always been a biter and recently he's started hitting. Especially when he doesn't get what he wants by also just in general.   Examples. Today he started getting fussy because I sat down with him on the couch instead of standing with him. He started crying and ""slapped""(failed his arm) at me. He also started hitting his father's head for fun. Then later he was sitting next to the dog petting her, this is new, so I said ""good job! Good gentle!"" To which he giggled and then hit her.

Son Hates His Present,"So my son turned 3 years old a few days ago. He got some money to spend on a new toy.

I searched for the new Wall-e toy online and Target had the best deal on it. Except all the Targets near us were sold out until next week. So I search and find one Target that has one left in stock. The hubs and I decide to go get it for baby boy. 

We get it, and as soon as we press the button to make Wall-e talk, my son bursts out into tears. Better yet, when we actually make the toy walk, he screams. The very thing he wanted horrified him.

Potty training SOS- day 3,"Hello all,
Stressed-out mom of a freshly two-year old boy here. We're trying the Oh Crap method and failing miserably. 3 says in and each day has seen a touch more improvement than the last, but that's really not saying much. I'm talking 2.5 pees and 1.3/2 poops made it into the potty today, and countless pees made it onto the floor. He pees (and sometimes starts pooping) on the floor constantly. A small, lightning-speed puddle will appear, he'll shout, ""Pee!"" then run around until our cries to get to the potty lead him to sit down. Then.... Nothing. He doesn't finish the pee. Ever. Not a drop. So we wait, we gently tell him how nice it would feel/be to let the pee out, and we read books or play with him while he sits on the potty. He will sometimes help us clean up, but usually we're more focused on trying to get him to finish the pee rather than make more of a mess. 

I've never seen someone with such bladder control that he can go 10, 15, 20 minutes at a time without a drop. Then he'll get up, take a lap around the room, and produce another small puddle for us to start the process over again with. I can even tell he really has to go from holding it so long, but the potty doesn't seem to do anything but shut everything up tight. The times he does go, even if it's just a drop, we're always sure to praise him and give him high-fives, and his face lights up. (We don't really want to go down the road of using other rewards.) But this isn't apparently enough to learn how to release his urine on purpose on the potty. Or does this sound like a behavior issue? My husband and I are at his wit's end, and on Monday when the workweek starts, I'll be all on own again. I'd suggest sending wine, but I'm also 19 weeks pregnant, so I've just resorted to eating junk food (like his leftover birthday cake!).

Getting overwhelmed with early intervention,"Hi! I’m new here and this is my first time posting. My son turned 2 on 08/03, I started to look into early intervention when he was a little over 18 months. He had a few words but not nearly what he was supposed to. We started with ABA (which wasn’t clarified until a couple of weeks ago, everyone kept referring to it as speech therapy) and he doesn’t love it. We started when everything was shutting down and have only done video calls, I’m doing the sessions with the therapist but everything seems to be a chore for him. 

Now, my main concern at the beginning was speech. They explained that the ABA needed to be the first step to ensure that he was able to sit down and pay attention during speech. We are in the process now of requesting speech and OT. 

Our therapist is a bit of an alarmist. Throughout the day he doesn’t behave like he does during the session, every little thing he does she comments about how she sees him having sensory issues and possibly stim (he crossed his fingers, avoids looking at me when I’m asking him to follow a command, and rocks back and forth trying to get out of the chair). I’m feeling very overwhelmed, I know that he doesn’t do any of that throughout the day but that’s all she sees during that hour. She mentioned that if I was to take him to a development pediatrician app he might end up diagnosed with autism. 

He plays pretend, has good eye contact throughout the day, imitated nursery rhymes and other things we do, gets excited when we’re going out and tries to put my shoes and he’s shoes on. Say bye and waves, can follow one step commands (turn light off, come or get out, sit, if you ask him to stop doing something he stops). 

He, however, avoids responding to his name. I say avoids because if I’m sitting facing him and say he’s name he’ll look. If my husband calls him he’ll look up but if he’s doing something and you call his name he won’t stop what he’s doing and look at you. She says that children he’s age are pleasers and he should be able to look up when he’s been called just to please us. 

Sometimes I look at him and I can see he’s behind, he’s never been around other children he’s age and has never been to daycare. A lot of the behaviors she sees and has mentioned do not happen when we’re out and about, he loves to be around other people. 

I know early intervention is great and the best thing we can do for him right now but I’m feeling very overwhelmed. I’m looking at him and almost trying to justify every little thing he does and it’s driving me nuts. His therapist did say once that if that wasn’t the behavior throughout the day that it was probably him being stubborn and wanting to be child-led instead of adult-directed. 

I wanted to see other’s experiences with the program. I don’t even know what a 2 year old should or shouldn’t be doing, kids are so different. When I called a few daycares to explain where he’s at right now, there response was that most 2 year olds are the same.

Unexpected trip to a hot spot city to help family member in a near fatal crash - what do I do when I get home to LO &amp; DH?,"Yesterday was a bit of a whirlwind - my dad was en route to his new house several states away, fell asleep at the wheel and rolled his car into a ditch. So very lucky to be alive. My sister and I hoped on the first flight we could catch to see him and figure what needs to be done - house is still in escrow, movers arrive tomorrow, the car was packed with odds and ends - and we’re an 8 hr drive from his new home.

It occurred to me this morning that I’ll need to quarantine when I get home. But how do I do that in a 2 bedroom apartment with a 2 yo? I’m already turn up that I didn’t get to say goodbye and no idea how long I’ll be away.

Sleep training for naps?,"Okay, hear me out.

We are all good with night time sleep. We have a routine. It works well. She sleeps all night. No issues there.

But I cannot seem to get her to take her nap on her own. As in *I have to rock her to sleep* or she won’t sleep at all. If I let her fall asleep on her own she’ll take her nap waaaay to close to night time and then won’t sleep until 1-2am. Not only that but she turns into shehulk and I get nothing done around the house and end up angry and frustrated.

She is at the point were she only takes one nap, which is right after lunch at around 1:30-2:00. She takes a looong time to fall asleep, 15mins to 30mins of rocking. I’ve tried to just cuddle but she doesn’t like it, *I need to rock her.* She is 18 months and starting to get heavy and sometimes fights sleep (and she *is* sleepy!) and throws her head back and gives me bruises. 

I’ve tried to just let her not sleep at her usual time and let her take her nap when she becomes exhausted but I couldn’t do it past the week. She just becomes unbearable to me. That 1:30min to 2hr nap she takes in the middle of the days makes us both more happy...

But I’m tired of rocking her to sleep. My right arm seems to have a bruise on it all the time. I know I should cherish this. She won’t need me to rock her to sleep soon. But dear lord I’m tired of it. 

I can’t make her room dark to simulate night, her room has a long rectangular window on the very top that’s not reachable. I’ve tried mimicking her sleep time routine and it hasn’t worked. 

Is there something I could do? Part me is guessing that there isn’t and I’ll have to endure this until she no longer takes naps....",1,"Sleep training for naps? Okay, hear me out.

2 year old suddenly crying at bedtime,"Hello all,

First time poster here. I have a 2 year old son (2 years, 2 months) who is normally a good sleeper. Did minor sleep training around 9 months to cut out night feeds, but other than that, I have just worked very hard to instill good habit (both in him and in us as parents).

We always do his nighttime routine, which ends with Mom, Dad and toddler reading 2 books together, then a family hug and in to bed he goes. Usually, no fussing occurs and he’s asleep within 15 minutes. I have a white noise machine with a nightlight on it, which we use for naps and nighttime.

For the last week or so, he has started to scream and cry when we leave the room. We have always shut his door tight which was never an issue. I do not want to get in to the habit of laying with him until he falls asleep. Yesterday, he cried for mom and dad for 10 minutes. Dad went in and rubbed his back for about 2-3 minutes, then left. Once again, toddler cried for about 10 minutes, and eventually put himself to sleep. I’m not one to usually let him cry it out, and normally wouldn’t allow him to cry for more than 15 minutes.

Thankfully he is not (yet) waking in the night, but wakes up crying between 5:30 and 6. Normally he will sleep until 6:30 at the earliest, and then play quietly until we go get him around 7. 

He was moved to a toddler bed in early August as he was climbing out of his crib. We had a minor setback after that but it only lasted about a week.

I have read about nighttime fears, 2 year molars, and other things that can affect sleep. I’m sure this is normal! Just looking for some tips and tricks that have worked for other parents in order to avoid having to stay with him until he falls asleep.

15 month old still not walking,"Hi ya’ll! So our almost 16 month old is still not walking on her own. She just started pulling herself up when in her crib or in the play area (there are long skinny bars so it’s easier for her wrap her hands around it). She never crawled and started scooting some months ago. Right after her first birthday she scooted her butt right off our bed. She broke her leg, it was a buckle fracture or something to that effect. The docs said she has since healed beautifully and will have no long term issues but she’s still not walking. She pretty much failed all the gross motor skills for the 15 month exam. She had only just started pulling her self up right before that apt. Doc said he isn’t concerned because it’s normal for a lot of kids not to walk until 18 months. Okay. Fine. 
Fast forward a month and today the daycare pulled me aside when I picked her up because they’re concerned she’s not pulling herself up. Now they say kids are falling over her. They asked if we have thought about physical therapy. Just wondering if anyone else has had this sort of experience. When I told the teacher that her doctor thinks she’ll be walking by Dec, and if not we’ll start therapy then she said it isn’t the walking that’s concerning her. It’s that she won’t move at all unless other kids are there and that she doesn’t know how to fall. (She mist falls, there’s no sort of bending legs or putting hands down to stop it). I don’t know what to do about the falling thing. I’m scared to let her fall since the whole broken leg thing. Our floors are so hard. 
I already felt crappy because of the whole leg debacle but I mean now I’m feeling even worse because i feel like I singlehandedly have delayed her development. Not sure what I’m looking for here.

Wasp Sting..,"So today my daughter got stung by a wasp. Which sucks on itself but...

It happened in her room.

I don't know how it got there, all I know is that it was her nap time and she randomly started screaming bloody murder. I ran in, saw a welt on her arm. Wasn't sure how it happened and tried asking but she just said ""nothing happened"". I stood up, and then I saw it. Crawling on top of her. I let it fall off and grabbed my daughter and booked it. 

Probably should have killed it but I didn't, and now the little bigger is nowhere to be found. 

On top of that, because it happened in her room, she is now scared of her room. I keep trying to assure her that I know it was scary but it is so unlikely it will happen again (though I'm worried because we never found the wasp.

• [condiment cup, baby spoon &amp; plastic bib](https://imgur.com/a/EmVsy16) is a great way for toddler to learn to eat yogurt, apple sauce, and cereal independently.

• [toddler shelf](https://imgur.com/a/JMSmjHv) in the fridge has been wonderful! We just started it, but all of her cups, and anything we would allow her to get on her own would be on this shelf!

DayCare difficulties 2.5 yo,"Hi All,
Just after some commiseration / figuring out if this is normal or a phase.

Our 2.5 year old loves day care. He hasn’t had any extended break from it. However day care mornings are a STRUGGLE. He will be happy then I get him out to bed and he cries. Then I change his nappy and he is happy. Feed him breakfast he is happy. Put on shoes and he throws a fit because he knows he is leaving the house. Happy in the car. As soon as he sees day care he starts crying. We can’t go into the centre because of COVID so the carers take him crying from my arms. However during day he LOVES day care and has no issues. Then home time comes and he runs away from me and hides and cries when we take him home.



It’s just very disheartening - he cries when we take him TO day care and cries when he has to go home. Can’t make him happy either way. He has been a bit miserable from teething (2yo molars) but this is even outside of that because even with pain medication and being perfectly happy five seconds ago he starts clinging to me like a koala. I’m just not sure what to do or if it’s just a phase as it’s only started recently.


I give him plenty of pre warning in the morning, I try to give him space and time to play in the morning and not “rush” him and stress him out, in the afternoons we give lots of love and cuddles. 

It’s just hard to not be able to make him happy.

Any ideas? Or is it just an expression of his frustration at lack of choice / control?

He’s been going to the same day care since he was 8 months old, hasn’t had a break, and used to be absolutely fine on drop off and pick up up until a couple of months ago.

He does have some gaps - he goes Mon, Tues, Thurs. so I wondered if he’s suddenly gotten old enough to feel really disrupted with an odd routine? Gah a bit clueless on this one which is why I’m hoping to tap your brains!",1,"DayCare difficulties 2.yo Hi All, Just after some commiseration / figuring out if this is normal or a phase.

Then I change his nappy and he is happy. Feed him breakfast he is happy. Put on shoes and he throws a fit because he knows he is leaving the house. Happy in the car. As soon as he sees day care he starts crying. We can’t go into the centre because of COVID so the carers take him crying from my arms. However during day he LOVES day care and has no issues. Then home time comes and he runs away from me and hides and cries when we take him home.    It’s just very disheartening - he cries when we take him TO day care and cries when he has to go home. Can’t make him happy either way. He has been a bit miserable from teething (2yo molars) but this is even outside of that because even with pain medication and being perfectly happy five seconds ago he starts clinging to me like a koala. I’m just not sure what to do or if it’s just a phase as it’s only started recently.   I give him plenty of pre warning in the morning, I try to give him space and time to play in the morning and not “rush” him and stress him out, in the afternoons we give lots of love and cuddles.   It’s just hard to not be able to make him happy.  Any ideas? Or is it just an expression of his frustration at lack of choice / control?  He’s been going to the same day care since he was months old, hasn’t had a break, and used to be absolutely fine on drop off and pick up up until a couple of months ago.  He does have some gaps - he goes Mon, Tues, Thurs. so I wondered if he’s suddenly gotten old enough to feel really disrupted with an odd routine?

Needy behavior at home after returning to daycare?,Hi everyone! My daughter is 19 months and due to my husband and  I returning to work he have put her back in daycare (a completely new one at that)! She has been home with us for 7 months so the transition has been a little difficult. We expected the crying at drop off and difficult with napping in beginning (both have happened) however just recently we’re experiencing some really needy and whiny behavior from her at home. Has anyone experienced this after putting their toddler back in daycare?  I suspect she’s probably having some insecurities and I’m happy to give her all the love she needs because  I know this is hard for her but I’m just curious if anyone else has had the same experience and if it settled down eventually.

Healthy snack ideas,"My 2.5 year old boy is in this phase of constant hunger (that I'm told will probably last to adulthood and beyond lol). The second he wakes up and comes downstairs, he's already pointing to the cupboard and screaming for something. He's not always into fruit, though he does it it, and he eats his meals well. But what are some good healthy snacks I won't feel guilty giving him?

We keep chips in the house but I don't want to give him chips, crackers, empty calorie stuff. I found some granola bars at Aldi with good ingredients and low sugar, those are working well. I'm also a good/experienced cook so I'm up for making something from scratch, but I'm out of ideas on what will satisfy his hunger urges and also not be super unhealthy. He loves crunchy stuff (don't we all) but even things like Veggie Straws have a ton of salt.

So, fellow parents of hangry toddlers, lend me your snack ideas and recipes! Preferably nothing that can be pressed into a couch or carpet to make a huge mess.

"Two and half, doesn't sleep through the night. Help.","My 2.5 year old boy still doesn't sleep through the night, and I'm at my wit's end. He's up usually 2 times a night, and I'm currently giving him a small bottle of half milk half water for him to fall back asleep. I'm trying to get it down to just water, but he throws a screaming fit if there isn't at least a splash of milk. 

We have tried, it seems, everything-- we've done sleep training, from gentle methods (me staying in the room and soothing, etc.) to the cry-it-out method, straight from the Ferber book. It seems like we've been attempting sleep training of one kind or another for literally the past 2 years straight. When we do the full on cry-it-out method it works for like a week, and then he'll skip a nap and we're right back where we started with him waking up again, I'm assuming from being overtired. If he misses a nap he'll wake up at night. If he naps even 20 minutes too long or an hour too late in the day he'll wake up. If he's teething, has a cold, misses me at night, if the window is too open or too closed, or if his sister makes noises in the room next door he'll wake up.

He's speech delayed, and a total extrovert, so I know that part of it is the inability to get all of his energy out during the day when we're stuck at home due to COVID and also the inability to reason him back to sleep. I would do more cry it out, but  and his screaming wakes up his sister and my partner and and honestly, I don't think I can handle it anymore-- he is incredibly stubborn about it, and simply refuses to sleep if I'm not there, sometimes for literally hours. At this point the bottle seems the easiest way to just get him back in his bed, but I'm so tired of being awake for 20-30 minutes twice a night to do that. I'm exhausted. I try to take him in bed with me to just go back to sleep, but this just wakes him up more, and he'll be playing with the blankets, climbing everywhere. 

So, hit me with all of your tips, tricks, advice, literally anything. At this point I'm pretty sure I'll be sending him back to bed with a bottle when he's headed off to college. Help.

Childcare in the time of COVID,"How does anyone who relies on childcare function in the time of COVID? My husband is a healthcare worker and can’t stay home. I am working from home, but my job is pretty demanding and my two year old mostly watches TV and doesn’t get the attention he really deserves when I am home with him. 

We are trying to be as cautious as possible. We socially distance, wear masks, avoid crowds, etc. I want to keep his classmates and teachers healthy. 

But how do you know when to keep your child home? Our son is relatively healthy, but almost always has some kind of runny nose or congestion. Especially in the fall or winter. I feel like there’s no way to avoid it! Today he had one loose stool, but has no other symptoms and is otherwise acting fine. Could it be COVID? Who knows?! How can we decide?

We’ve been calling his doctor when he has cold symptoms, but the doctor always recommends he gets tested. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t really want to get him tested and keep him home for a week every time he has a runny nose. It’s extremely disruptive to my work and, most importantly, it’s really hard for him to constantly readjust. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for, just thoughts on what others are doing. I don’t want to be the parent who gets everyone sick, but I also don’t want to constantly pull my son out of class when he has a stuffy nose, or coughs, or seems a little fussy, etc.

Note: All of the teachers and staff at his daycare wear masks. I always keep him home when we have been in contact with someone who is COVID + (has happened twice). My concern is more related to when he has random cold like symptoms for seemingly no reason 🤷‍♀️",1,"Childcare in the time of COVID How does anyone who relies on childcare function in the time of COVID?

Best position?,"this might seem like a random question, however, a friend asked me this the other day, and it got me to thinking. I wanted to see if others share my same method.

note that I am speaking here of a child who would be at least two or three years old, not an infant.

when changing a child's disposable diaper, I am right handed. therefore, are usually form a capital T shape between my body and the child. in other words, I will usually stand on one side of the bed/surface and the child will be lying perpendicular to me. since I am right handed, their head will usually be to my left, and their feet/toes will be pointed to my right side. so if you can picture this, when cleaning them, I lift their legs up into my left toward their chest.

I tend to find having them lying perpendicular to me it is a lot more comfortable for me.

I am told that a lot of parents/caregivers do not do it this way. my best friend actually has the child lying parallel to them. so, their head is facing away from them, and their toes are pointed straight out toward my friends chest. forming more of a straight vertical line shape.

i've seen it done both ways, but I just don't see how one could get the angle correct having the child be parallel. I was curious which method most of you on this sub Reddit prefer. perhaps I should try the other method, but I just don't think my leverage would be nearly as good.",1,"Best position? this might seem like a random question, however, a friend asked me this the other day, and it got me to thinking.

"Update: Overly clingy toddler has gotten a lot easier, but is still challenging","Two and a half years ago, I posted about my 18-month old who refused to leave me alone, and my difficulties with that.  I frequently got so frustrated with her clinginess that I lost my temper.  I was feeling stressed because I was expecting another baby, and wasn't sure how to cope with it all.  

I'm here to report that it got a lot better, and to give other moms with clingy kids some encouragement.  

The first year of my new baby's life was really hard.  My first child still wanted all of my attention.  My second was happy to play by herself or to flip through a book while on my lap, so my first child was successful in sucking up all my attention.  The only real memories I have of my second child's first year are from when my first kid was napping.   I'm really sad about this, to be honest.  But I'm not really sure what I could have changed.  My first child learned to recognize when I was about to lose my temper, and would leave me alone if I was about to blow (but not until then), but that tended to mean that my second kid walked into a primed bomb.  It was still kind of miserable, and I still felt like a bad mom.   
 
This all started to really change about 8 months ago.  My younger child got old enough to play with the elder, and it was amazing.  Now, my mornings consist of only intermittent interacting with my children, instead of constant haranguing, and I love it.  I also feel like I can give my second kid more attention, as I'm not constantly emotionally tapped out.

My younger kid's naptimes are the most difficult part of my day.  I've instituted ""Mommy's break time.""  The older is to leave me alone for an hour after the younger has gone to sleep, then we'll do something together.  This goes less well.  Often, she will sit next to me, bored, and attempt to get my attention.  She usually refuses to play alone.  I often have to send her to her room to get a true break.  

My elder child also balks at being away from the house without me.  She was upset with me for days after attending a friend's birthday party I didn't stay for, despite me telling her beforehand I was dropping her off.  I want to sign her up for a once a week program, but she says she doesn't want to be away from me.  It's frustrating.

I would say our relationship is still more difficult than I would like.  She still has really intense needs (wants?  It's hard to know.  I'm sure she perceived them as needs), and we still occasionally get into patterns where I feel smothered and she feels ignored, but I don't lose my temper anymore.  It's not because I changed, though that was what I was hoping for two and a half years ago, it's because the circumstances around me changed and made it easier to parent my challenging child.

2 Year Old Tantrums are Insane!,"I get he wants to do everything himself, BUT DEARLORD, KID! 
I literally have to duck to not get smacked in the face!! We’re working on that, but it’s been a struggle.
It’s hard to “teach in the moment” when he’s off the rails like that, and after the fact he doesn’t seem to care? I know that sounds awful- but it’s like he’s like yeah whatever, mom lol

Example: His daycare has this amazing full size wooden train for the kids to play on- because of COVID it’s off limits and they just want parents to redirect the kids instead of putting up barriers. My son loves this train- LOVES IT. I get it, it’s not fair!!
His classroom is directly in front of this train and he knows it- when we go to leave he refuses to be carried because he can do it himself- he’ll hold my hand until we get to the door- then he BOLTS for the train.
If I hold his hand forcefully I’m afraid I’ll dislocate his arm because this boy is STRONG. So I do the best I can but he gets away.
I talk to him about it and try to get him to follow me out- it’s a hot mess and I’m embarrassed as my kid is SCREAMING and going boneless when I try to pick him up. I try again and he starts yelling “OW! OW OW OW OW OW!!”
I’m mortified- he’s never done this! I’m not hurting him, but I’m afraid people think iam since he’s yelling OW!
I manage to get him out of the daycare kicking and screaming to have him go boneless again so I put him down- he RUNS away laughing- I’m yelling STOP NO FREEZE like we’ve been talking about, but it’s now a game.
I finally get him and carry him to the car kicking and screaming- he’s trying to smack me/hit me/kick me in protest and I finally get him in the car seat.
We drive 2 feet and then he’s fine and says “hi” with a smile.

My 2.5-year-old throws a huge fit if I try to get her to wear a face mask for public places,"I have tried a cute cloth Hello Kitty mask, cute disposable masks, a face shield with a cute bunny on it (she doesn't have to wear a mask then), putting a mask on some of her dolls, being a model and wearing a mask correctly (dad wears a mask too), and I think I've run out of ideas. She's my first child so there's no one closer to her age wearing masks except during occasional trips to the store and I might see a small child wearing a mask. 

She's at that age where many places require a mask on, but a few places don't require a mask on a 2-year-old. So far she usually gets away with not wearing a mask, but I worry that we'll be turned away from places like the aquarium (so far the one nearest me has only opened the outdoor part of the aquarium and masks are required for 2 years and up).

Since my daughter refuses to wear a mask, the only few places I take her are the park, the beach, and every once in a while a grocery store if I really need to go. I try to not take her places with too many people around. 

Is this problem just age-related? She's fine washing her hands and with the progress we've made on toilet training, but she won't wear a mask. Should I just relent and let her never wear a face mask?

Concerned by 18m/o attachment to TV?,"Hi all,

so our daughter is coming 18months, that last couple weeks we've let TV into her schedule because she's exhausting, she seemed interested and also old enough.  Also, I saw a post here about several shows that are basically designed to help them learn before schooltime.

We let her have about 45minutes in the morning (which we've since removed due to our concerns in her behaviour.). She wants baby bum or dave and ava on youtube which is basically nursery rhymes.

While watching, her eyes are basically glazed over and she's not very responsive or interactive.  I definitely think it has helped with her learning of numbers etc but when it comes time to turn it off, she usually gets a warning or two about what's going to happen.  Usually we get a 'nooooo' or something and plough on.

This morning for example, she was crying, screaming no and generally writhing around.  She takes a bit of calming down and then is demanding milk from her mum (we're assuming this is for comfort because she's upset or that she's just lost watching tv and doesn't realise she's hungry.)

Has anyone had similar to this?  I'd like to keep some short sittings in every couple days at least but her attachment/reaction and behaviour while watching has me a little spooked.  This is our first and only daughter so we're completely dumb as to how parenting works as you can tell..it has been difficult!",1,"Concerned by 18m/o attachment to TV?

Also, I saw a post here about several shows that are basically designed to help them learn before schooltime.  We let her have about 45minutes in the morning (which we've since removed due to our concerns in her behaviour.). She wants baby bum or dave and ava on youtube which is basically nursery rhymes.  While watching, her eyes are basically glazed over and she's not very responsive or interactive.  I definitely think it has helped with her learning of numbers etc but when it comes time to turn it off, she usually gets a warning or two about what's going to happen.  Usually we get a 'nooooo' or something and plough on.  This morning for example, she was crying, screaming no and generally writhing around.  She takes a bit of calming down and then is demanding milk from her mum (we're assuming this is for comfort because she's upset or that she's just lost watching tv and doesn't realise she's hungry.)  Has anyone had similar to this?  I'd like to keep some short sittings in every couple days at least but her attachment/reaction and behaviour while watching has me a little spooked.  This is our first and only daughter so we're completely dumb as to how parenting works as you can tell..it has been difficult!",36,6,1395,243,Question

Daycare drop off not getting easier,"I work part time and drop my son (19mo) off at daycare twice a week. We’ve been doing this since mid August. He loves daycare. He loves being with kids, he eats and naps really well, and when he walks out in the afternoons he is always happy and blowing kisses at the ladies. I’ve been told multiple stories of how he will go out of his way to find adults to give them a hug.  

But drop off is brutal. He is fussing as soon as we pull on the street and is screaming, crying, and pushing himself into his car seat plus not letting me unbuckle him. 


We talk about school a lot. We talk about what he does and how mommy always comes to pick him up because adults alway come back. I tell him it’s okay to be sad.  I feel like we do a good job of prepping him and letting him express his feelings, but it really breaks my heart that he’s having such a hard time with that one transition.

Potty training regression help?,"We did the Oh Crap! Method last year with my now-3.5 yo. He still wears a pull-up over night but he has been stably using the potty for about a year now with infrequent accidents.

In the past week he has had two major pants-floods and we suspect he is not going potty at all when told, then turning the water on and not washing his hands. 

We are going to rescind privacy rights today to make sure he is actually going pee but has anyone else dealt with this sort of issue and can offer advice?

Why won’t you Effin eat?,"We have a 22 month old boy, who was born 9 weeks early. All of his developmental and growth targets have been met or exceeded.

Overwhelmed!,"Hello,

Do any other parents here have experience with their toddler possibly having a Sensory Processing Disorder? I would love to hear from other parents that have dealt with something similar and would love to know if you have any advice. I feel kind of lost.

My son is 18 months. I've known there was something going on with him since he was at least a year (his cousin of the same age was way more advanced in language, communication, and play) but his pediatrician at the time was about to retire and was very dismissive (I got the whole ""you're a first time mom, calm down, he's probably fine"" spiel). I got the same thing from family and tried to let things go and not worry. I brought up my concerns at his 15 month and the pediatrician we saw said it was too early to set up speech and language interventions and that all children develop at different rates. Anyway, fast forward to the 18 month check up- We'd since moved across the country and his new pediatrician immediately put through four referrals for evaluations for hearing, speech, OT, and to a developmental pediatrician. 

I'm happy that my son has a pediatrician that is taking things seriously, but man, this is overwhelming. I feel like we went from 0-60 all of the sudden. I spoke to a developmental pediatrician on the phone today and did a screener with her. She sounded pretty alarmed by some of my son's behaviors and she suspects he has some type of sensory processing issue (along with the speech and language delay). Me and my husband have been thinking the same thing and my husband has noise issues and I have some tactile issues, so it's not a huge surprise. There are certain sounds (like a cow mooing and certain harmonizing in songs) that make my son terrified. He also is obsessed with touching other children, which makes going to the playground hard in the midst of social distancing and it makes me really worried about his ability to make friends as he gets older. The issue at the moment is that all the various people we need to schedule evaluations with are booked out like crazy and hard to get ahold of. Also the developmental pediatrician wants us to find him some friends to play with but we're new to the area and are still in quarantine mode. I'm feeling kind of alone and would love to hear from other parents. I feel like I want to help my son while we're waiting for evaluations and services to get started, but I have no idea where to start. Woo! Thank you!",1,"Overwhelmed!

Depressed husband = stressed parent,"My husband has been struggling with depression this year (understandable) and I have a lot of sympathy for him.  Except for his impatient, crappy parenting!  Our almost 3yo son prefers me right now, I'm assuming because I can keep it together.  If his dad tries to get our kid to eat or get dressed and he's being difficult, my husband takes it personally, loses his patience,  then sulks.  I am OVER IT! 

This morning our kid woke up cranky, my husband's bad attitude and stressed out response accelerated that crankiness into a drawn out tantrum.  It's like adding fuel to the fire.  Then my husband has the gall to yell at me about how badly behaved our son is *while I am trying to help him calm down* because we have to leave for daycare in 10 minutes.  

Ugh I am feeling the pressure from both sides and it is getting harder to not be resentful towards my husband.  I think one of the most difficult parts of this is that we were separated for the majority of last month while he was trying to get a handle on his anger/depression.

Need help!! There is a visiting naughty (nasty?) toddler at home.,"I have a son (3.5 years) and a daughter (8 months). My son is quite (hyper) active. So my sister decided to drop her daughter (3 years) at my place for a week. Two kids would cancel out each other we will get some etc. was the idea. (sigh). 
The girl is quite physical and doesn't know fear. Firm words, stares or even occasional raising of voice has no impact on her. She and the boy have been fighting over every thing. She pushes him quite often and also hits him. Boy doesn't reciprocate ( at least with full conviction) because he knows we will punish him. 
Now, a while ago she pushed him from a chair and his head almost hit a sharp corner. Now I'm quite annoyed, but I can't do anything, if it was my son doing this I know the levers to push and make him regret his actions. With this girl I have no leverage and she continues to operate in this mode. 
I am quite disappointed and sad, I am thinking maybe I shouldn't invited her over again ( on one side) and on the other side thinking of giving punishments and building leverage on her ( I don't know if I have the authority of teaching somebody else's kids manners and even if so how far can I go). Overall i am feeling very bad.

22 month old and speaking,"Hello!  Just a question I am hoping to get a perspective on.

I have a 22 month old daughter, and my wife is starting to be concerned that we will need to see a speech pathologist.  Currently, she is saying 23 words regularly, but has spoken many others either once or for a brief period of time.  She definitely understands what we are saying to her or asking her her to do, just doesn't seem to want to speak.  She is a very efficient at pointing to get to what she wants.

I think it may be a confidence thing.  If you ask her to say a word at normal volume, most often she doesn't try.  But if you whisper to her, you can see her trying to form the words with her lips and sometimes you can hear her trying to make the sounds.

Is this something that is to be expected?  Any advice on trying to get her to try more words?

We also did send a message to the pediatrician today to check in as well.",1,"month old and speaking Hello!  Just a question I am hoping to get a perspective on.

3.5 Year Old Not Potty Trained. Seriously stressing me out.,"I'm sure this isn't an uncommon problem but I'm starting to feel like a failure as a parent. She does pretty well at home with peeing, but she goes to daycare 3 days a week and has an accident almost every day. I think she is maybe too shy to tell her teachers? I am trying to communicate with them but we don't get face to face interaction because of covid restrictions so I'm having to do it over text. She will also wait until she's in a diaper to poop or she will have an accident in her underwear. She's pooped in the potty a handful of times, but not much. We reward with stickers and M&amp;Ms.

3 year old FINALLY pooped in the potty!,"I am elated, and so proud. Also a little concerned that I'm this excited about poop. 

My 3 year old has been resisting pooping in the potty for a while now. And he hates getting his butt wiped to the point that he was going out of his way not to tell us and just tried to poop in his shorts even though he was right in front of us.

We never thought it would end. It was painful and has lead to more than one power struggle.

But a few days ago we were at Target, and he saw a bag of M&amp;Ms and asked for them. I decided to use it as a motivational tool and told him we would get them, but he would only get M&amp;Ms when he pooped in the potty, 1 for trying, 5 for succeeding.

So today I was standing in the kitchen getting food for the cat when my husband and son come downstairs and my husband is telling our 3 year old he will give him an M&amp;M for sitting on the potty.

3 year old sits on the potty and gets an M&amp;M, then promptly decides one is not enough. So he asks for more and we tell him that he can't have any more until he poops in the potty.

Son disappears into the bathroom and my husband and I don't think much of it. I feed the cat and start filling the soda stream bottles when our son announces ""I pooped in the potty!""

I look at my husband skeptically and go to investigate and sure enough, there it is. An almost man-sized poop sitting in the toilet.

We were thrilled; we partied and 3 year old got way more than 5 M&amp;Ms. He is currently bouncing off the walls from all the sugar, but I truly feel like we finally hit a turning point with this whole potty training thing and I pray it continues to go this way. \*fingers crossed!\*",1,"year old FINALLY pooped in the potty!

In 1 week this simple advice made a world of difference.,"I wanted to share this advice with fellow moms and dads of Jr explorers...aka toddlers. I was reading an article discussing ways to build self esteem and confidence in our kids. Specifically for toddlers it explained that we shouldn’t discourage them from climbing and exploring (in appropriate locations like the park) due to our own fears. And the way they explained it has made a huge difference in both my toddlers’ (3&amp;4yo) within a week or less. So instead of discouraging them from climbing too high or attempting something they see the older kids do that might be too advanced, ask them what their plan is or, what are they going to do after they take another step higher. So I started doing this right away when my adventurous 3yo would get brave. I wouldn’t stop him, u would ask him “so you got up that high, now make a plan to get down. Then suggest places to put their feet and so on. This way of encouraging critical thinking has changed both of my kids entire outlook on life outside of home. And after they complete a big task without your help you could see the bells in their brains make the connection. They were so proud of themselves that they have implemented this “so what’s your plan?” Advice in other areas. It took maybe 4 trips to the park and my kids gained a sense of self confidence that i am so proud of. Since then the whining and unsure behavior has all but stopped. It has made my household a more calm place. I wish everyone the best.

My almost 3yo daughter and her pretending,"She has always been ahead of other kids her age, but since it’s just me and her at home all day, and because of covid, I think she’s getting lonely. Even when we’re at the park she has a hard time playing with others even when she tries. 

I’m mentioning this because I’m afraid it could’ve also effected her.. me and my s/o especially in the beginning really lack communication skills and are very different people. This results in screaming at each other during fights. The last year it has been significantly better, less than a handful of time, but at the beginning it was a lot. I’m worried that this has effected her, for the worst, and given her anxiety. Please don’t shame me this is something we’ve worked super hard on, and every time it has resolved immediately after and we are able to talk about it. But the last year we have been able to talk about it (whatever the issue) before it turns into yelling. 

I also worry that my parenting skills effect her, we don’t spank, I try to be at her level and explain, but when something has gone to far I tell her to go to her room and have a time out or a break. She comes back when she is ready I never make her stay there. I also worry about a time where she would not sleep, no matter what we would do she would be up all night and would flail and scream and cry when we put her in her bed for hours and hours. So I would bear hug her until she calmed down, because she would sometimes hurt her self throwing her head back against the wall or jumping off her bed on accident. 

I never questioned my parenting being too much before this pretending has happened but now I worry that I have messed her up and given her anxiety or some disorder😭 I can’t help but feel like I am doing things wrong.

So with the pretending, it started around spring time, she was pretending to be a dog, and his name is buster puppy. To get her to do anything while she was pretending we have to address her as such. This wasn’t super offer maybe once a day being short lived. Fast forward to now it is almost always all day long, she has a range of different characters most recently being “fancy” I am pregnant and was really struggling with sickness in the beginning and going to the doctors a lot. This resulted in a huge change or pace in our house, so I think this could also have an affect on her as well. 

But she get extremely upset if we do not call her who she is “pretending” to be, sometimes she doesn’t even know. She will not settles down until we say okay, or okay fancy or whoever she is. She is never herself, and I think the only time she is “herself” is when I adress her as ruby and she maybe forgets or is to distracted to realize I called her by her name and not who she wants to be. I was pretty worried about this last week, I relaxed and came to the conclusion that she is just very bright for her age, and will grow out of it. But last night we were all laying in bed together, she couldn’t sleep because we had a small road trip back home right before bed which she was asleep for in the car. She was looking at the ceiling saying that ruby is stuck there, after I was trying to explain that when mom and dad talk to you and say ruby we need to talk to Ruby. She would not accept and was puppy until she fell asleep. But before sleep she was talking. About knifes and something on the ceiling, I reminded her that knives are only for food, and she went on to pretending that she was just picking food and cutting it. 

Also around the time she started pretending she started picking her nails which has got a little better. 

She pretends in a lot of different ways too, about places and things, really about anything.

So I don’t want to overly worry about this because sometimes she just seems to be having fun I don’t want to disrupt that. But I really am starting to get worried that she is never herself, and that ruby is “over there” being invisible, and that she is someone else all the time. I’m worried she’ll start to fully believe it and develop some sort or identity disorder. Which led me to google which led me to think that I have done something wrong that has affected her 😭😭😭 

Should I bring her to a psychologist, I really feel like that is too much for a child her age but I am so worried and I don’t want to mess anything up and make her not want to be herself even more, or just to know that truly that pretending at this length is in fact normal 😣",1,"My almost 3yo daughter and her pretending She has always been ahead of other kids her age, but since it’s just me and her at home all day, and because of covid, I think she’s getting lonely.

She pretends in a lot of different ways too, about places and things, really about anything.  So I don’t want to overly worry about this because sometimes she just seems to be having fun I don’t want to disrupt that. But I really am starting to get worried that she is never herself, and that ruby is “over there” being invisible, and that she is someone else all the time. I’m worried she’ll start to fully believe it and develop some sort or identity disorder. Which led me to google which led me to think that I have done something wrong that has affected her 😭😭😭   Should I bring her to a psychologist, I really feel like that is too much for a child her age but I am so worried and I don’t want to mess anything up and make her not want to be herself even more, or just to know that truly that pretending at this length is in fact normal 😣",41,7,4437,864,

A Dog and His Boy,"I am a father of a 3 year old boy and a cavelier King Charles spaniel (the same type of dog as lady from Lady and the Tramp). They aren't super close but they get along fine.

My 3 year old has finally been fully potty trained in the last month. We've had some issues with him playing in the sink instead of just washing his hands so we moved his little potty outside of the bathroom. 


So a little earlier today my son goes and says he has to potty. He uses it and takes one of the most massive duece logs I've ever seen from him. He tries to run off without wiping or dumping the specimen into the real potty and flushing it. I help him wipe and then his 1 year old sister starts crying from the other room. I run to check on her while son is washing his hands. Then son comes and asks for his reward for going potty, then it's time to put sister down for nap.


I come out from putting her down for nap and remember that we never got rid of his impressive bowel candy from earlier. I go to take care of it but it's gone. I ask my son if he dumped it in the potty and he said no. I look around horrified that there's no this brown monstrosity lurking somewhere in our house probably smooshed into the carpet.

Diaper change = WWIII; HELP!,"My DD just turned 2. She isn't showing any readiness for toilet training so please don't suggest this as a solution :-)

Over the last few months all diaper changes have become progressively more difficult. I've employed the strategies I picked up reading various books but nothing works. Not holding my phone, the tablet, toy, FaceTime with my mom, talking nicely, etc. She has sensitive skin so she can't sit in a soiled diaper for too long. The few times I've let her sit with a poop and told her ""let me know when you're ready to clean your bum"" she will just never be ready. I talk her through it in a nice voice, make silly voices, ask her what wrong,etc. My strategies are successful about 2 out of 10 times. 

So now whenever it's time to change her, she screams, flails around, gets so upset she's choking on her own tears. It takes two of us to change her through force. She screams to not have her pants and diaper taken off, then once they're off and she's clean she screams to stay naked and not have a clean diaper and pants put back on. She screams ""no!"" so loudly I'm afraid CPS is going to be called on us.

This also happens when it's time to change from PJs into daytime clothes or daytime clothes into PJs.

I'm at my wit's end and truly dislike being a parent when this happens and I'm struggling to work through it. I'm in my bedroom cooling off from the diaper change we just did because there was a moment when I wanted to spank her (we don't do that, and I'm ashamed to admit the thought crossed my mind) and I knew I needed to walk away.

Is this developmental? Did someone hurt her (she goes to daycare 2 days a week so now my mind is going into overdrive)? What am I doing wrong? Does this happen to everyone and I just need to trudge on? 

PLEASE HELP!",1,"Diaper change = WWIII; HELP! My DD just turned 2. She isn't showing any readiness for toilet training so please don't suggest this as a solution :-)  Over the last few months all diaper changes have become progressively more difficult. I've employed the strategies I picked up reading various books but nothing works. Not holding my phone, the tablet, toy, FaceTime with my mom, talking nicely, etc. She has sensitive skin so she can't sit in a soiled diaper for too long. The few times I've let her sit with a poop and told her ""let me know when you're ready to clean your bum"" she will just never be ready. I talk her through it in a nice voice, make silly voices, ask her what wrong,etc. My strategies are successful about out of times.   So now whenever it's time to change her, she screams, flails around, gets so upset she's choking on her own tears. It takes two of us to change her through force. She screams to not have her pants and diaper taken off, then once they're off and she's clean she screams to stay naked and not have a clean diaper and pants put back on. She screams ""no!"" so loudly I'm afraid CPS is going to be called on us.  This also happens when it's time to change from PJs into daytime clothes or daytime clothes into PJs.

We had a good day!,"Not all days are like this. Two nights ago I messaged my husband that I didn't want to do it anymore. Then both boys (2yo and 2mo sharing a room) were screaming instead of sleeping. 

But today, my 2yo made me laugh by nursing his lovey. He even made it burp. And the lovey needed a diaper, so he got the diaper holder from his daycare bag and wiped its bum with a wet wipe and tried to stick it in a new diaper. It looked professional! 

Then he layed down himself and told me he needed a new diaper too. So I changed a lovely poopy diaper without fuss (that's rare!).

Later he removed his pants and diaper himself and sat on the potty. He knows what the potty is for and how it's used, but he rarely wants to go himself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, we are currently seeking autism evaluations at the regional medical centers (in MD, Kennedy Krieger, National Children's Hospital, and Mt. Washington).

**Kennedy Kreiger and National Children's Hospital'****s** evaluations appear to be very comprehensive, as it is an evaluation by a team (SLP, Occupational Therapist, and Clinical Psychologist):  

SLP will evaluate your child’s expressive and receptive language and social interaction. The SLP will use structured and semi-structured assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations to evaluate your child's speech and language. Information gathered from the evaluation will help the SLP determine your child’s strengths and deficits, and thus develop recommendations for enhancing the child’s language and interaction.

Occupational Therapist (OT) will assess your child’s gross motor, fine motor, visual motor, visual perceptual, oral and sensory processing skills. The use of standardized and non-standardized assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations will be used to assess your child’s patterns of strength and need that impact daily performance of functional tasks. Recommendations will be provided for home, school and community implementation.

clinical psychologist: Following the evaluation with the SLP and OT, you and your child will meet with a clinical psychologist. The psychologist will conduct a clinical interview to obtain information about your child’s birth and developmental history, medical history, and social and behavioral history. The psychologist will also perform a standardized evaluation of your child's play, behavior, and social skills. Information collected during the interview, intake information gathered prior to your visit, evaluation, behavioral observations of your child, and results from the assessments with SLP will be reviewed in order to provide diagnostic impressions and information related to behavioral/psychological functioning. The clinical psychologist will provide recommendations regarding additional interventions or follow-up services that may be beneficial for your child.

  


Unfortunately, with those two hospitals, the current wait time is 6-10 months for in-person evaluations.  We had a consultation with a Pediatric Psychologist from Mt Washington last week and was told that Mt Washington offers telemed evaluation, instead of a team of specialists it will just be the Pediatric Psychologist, having us parents interact with our boy following her instructions while she observes over the laptop camera.   

&amp;#x200B;

Our question right now is should we do the telemed evaluation by a pediatric psychologist or wait for an in-person evaluation by a team?  The psychologist said SLP/OT arent really necessary for an autism diagnosis since cognitive/language issues isnt part of the autism diagnosis.  Instead, it is based on two areas - social communication and any restricted/repetitive patterns or interests.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since our 24mo is starting speech therapy soon, even without the diagnosis, we were wondering if we should wait or get an evaluation asap via telemed.  What do you all think?

The SLP will use structured and semi-structured assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations to evaluate your child's speech and language. Information gathered from the evaluation will help the SLP determine your child’s strengths and deficits, and thus develop recommendations for enhancing the child’s language and interaction.  Occupational Therapist (OT) will assess your child’s gross motor, fine motor, visual motor, visual perceptual, oral and sensory processing skills. The use of standardized and non-standardized assessment tools, a parent interview, and clinical observations will be used to assess your child’s patterns of strength and need that impact daily performance of functional tasks. Recommendations will be provided for home, school and community implementation.  clinical psychologist: Following the evaluation with the SLP and OT, you and your child will meet with a clinical psychologist. The psychologist will conduct a clinical interview to obtain information about your child’s birth and developmental history, medical history, and social and behavioral history. The psychologist will also perform a standardized evaluation of your child's play, behavior, and social skills. Information collected during the interview, intake information gathered prior to your visit, evaluation, behavioral observations of your child, and results from the assessments with SLP will be reviewed in order to provide diagnostic impressions and information related to behavioral/psychological functioning. The clinical psychologist will provide recommendations regarding additional interventions or follow-up services that may be beneficial for your child.       Unfortunately, with those two hospitals, the current wait time is 6-months for in-person evaluations.  We had a consultation with a Pediatric Psychologist from Mt Washington last week and was told that Mt Washington offers telemed evaluation, instead of a team of specialists it will just be the Pediatric Psychologist, having us parents interact with our boy following her instructions while she observes over the laptop camera.     &amp;#x200B;  Our question right now is should we do the telemed evaluation by a pediatric psychologist or wait for an in-person evaluation by a team?  The psychologist said SLP/OT arent really necessary for an autism diagnosis since cognitive/language issues isnt part of the autism diagnosis.  Instead, it is based on two areas - social communication and any restricted/repetitive patterns or interests.    &amp;#x200B;  Since our 24mo is starting speech therapy soon, even without the diagnosis, we were wondering if we should wait or get an evaluation asap via telemed.  What do you all think?  Thanks so much.",49,8,3968,584,Question

Sleep help for room sharing siblings,"Looking for ideas regarding sibling room sharing sleep: Currently have a newly 2 year old and a 3.5 year old who share a room and have since sleep training the younger one. 3.5 yr old is in a  toddler bed, 2yr old in crib. Both still nap at daycare (about 1-1.5 hr), bedtime is currently between 7:15 and 7:30pm. We have an okay to wake clock that turns yellow at 605 which is when they can get up. The problem is that the 3.5 yr old is waking up any where between 5 and 545, sometimes because he needs to poop, other times he's just awake. I always take him back to his room, telling him he can get up when his clock turns yellow but I'm getting tired of him waking up early. I think the 2 yr old would sleep longer as well if he wasn't being woken up by the older one.

Any thoughts? Separate rooms is not an option.

How does soothing at bedtime change in the toddler years?,"I have an 18 month old. Sleep trained at 9 months and he is generally a great sleeper - rolled over when he went into his crib and babbled a bit until he went to sleep then not a peep until morning. 

In the last month, he’s been losing his mind at bedtime. Absolutely hysterical when I put him down and leave the room.

I can’t go up - if I do, he is on his feet climbing into my arms wanting to snuggle and melts down when I leave. 

It has led to a debate between my husband and I. He says we stay the sleep training course and give my son space to settle with a little bit of help (back rubs). I’m struggling with letting him get hysterical. And find it hard to believe that when my son is a bit older and verbal and says “mama stay with me,” I just pat his back and walk away.

Kid screams AFTER nap?,"Okay so our son is 2, 26-ish months. He's always been a good sleeper but lately he's pushing it and fights a little for naps, but generally he still gets his sleep. We've learned over time to let him wake up and not get him til he's happy lol.. otherwise tantrum ensues. I figure that's like any person--doesn't want to get up from a nap until they're ready. 

But every so often he'll be ready to get up (seemingly happy) and we'll go in to get him, he'll say hi like usual, and then he starts screaming and saying ""no"" over and over. He'll push us away and then grab our hands and drag us somewhere (kitchen, living room) and then start yelling no again. He has a decent vocabulary normally but at these times we can't get him to express what he wants. We offer all his usual faves, nothing. We just have to ride it out over like a half hour's time. 

I don't know if I'm asking for advice or just wanting to know wtffff this is. Probably just complaining 😄 Toddlers, man. But hey if anyone went through this, you let me know if you managed to fix it.

But every so often he'll be ready to get up (seemingly happy) and we'll go in to get him, he'll say hi like usual, and then he starts screaming and saying ""no"" over and over. He'll push us away and then grab our hands and drag us somewhere (kitchen, living room) and then start yelling no again. He has a decent vocabulary normally but at these times we can't get him to express what he wants. We offer all his usual faves, nothing. We just have to ride it out over like a half hour's time.   I don't know if I'm asking for advice or just wanting to know wtffff this is. Probably just complaining 😄 Toddlers, man. But hey if anyone went through this, you let me know if you managed to fix it.

3.5 year old’s first camping trip — advice?,"Hi all, 

We’re doing a camping trip at a developed campground close to home (about 30 minutes) next month. Our daughter (3.5) is very excited to go and we want to make sure it is a good experience for her. My husband and I both have experience camping but this will be our first time camping with our kid.

I’m a notorious over-planner while still remaining practical (I just like being prepared! Ha!). It’s probably going to be warm in the day and a little chilly at night (averages are 80s in day, 50s at night). I’m planning to bring her roll-up nap mat blanket from home (the kind with built in pillow) to stick inside her 45 degree rated sleeping bag, and plenty of blankets, layers, socks, etc to be sure none of us are cold. (I tend to get cold at night while sleeping.) We’ll all be on insulated self-inflating mattress pads.

Aside from the basics (first aid, water, folding chairs, extra snacks, tons of wipes, books, sound machine, flashlights/lanterns, etc), and fun stuff like s’mores and glow sticks, any other things I should keep in mind that I may not have thought of yet? She is mostly potty trained (still needs reminding sometimes and had her first accident in a couple months this week) and our site is right next to a bathroom (flushing toilets), so at least we won’t need to run too far!

ASD concerns,"Spiraling parent here, with some concerns about our 16 month old son.

-frequently does not respond to name when engrossed/really interested in something else 
-has recently developed a pretty keen fascination with things that spin
-has begun crossing fingers in a strange way, particularly when anxious...also, holds arms up at chest level, bent at the elbow with fingers postured while walking
-flaps arms when excited, mad, anxious (for a couple of seconds at a time, not prolonged and can be distracted out of it)
-can be very, very shy and slow to warm up in new situations/with new people
-loves playing with strings  

Things he also does that seem quite normal: points appropriately, knows a handful of words and animal sounds, self-feeds a variety of foods well, gives kisses/affection, follows simple directions, plays peek-a-boo and usually has decent eye contact (although, as mentioned above, it can often be difficult to get his attention if he’s really into whatever toy/book he’s playing with). Even though he’s shy and anxious on the playground and around new people/kids, he definitely enjoys playing/interacting with a 2 year old girl he knows very well.

Naps and daycare,"Hi guys, interested to hear your experiences of toddler naps at daycare - especially if they have bad or no naps there- and whether that has an effect on their naps/sleep/life at home. 

My son (2) started daycare a couple of weeks ago, and currently he's only there from 9-12 because I am 95% sure he won't have good naps there. So I prefer him to come home and have his nap at home. A bunch of our friends had kids start daycare recently too, and they all say their kids either don't nap there at all some days, or only sleep for 30 minutes (where they'd usually sleep 2-3 hours at home). There's a chart on the wall detailing the times of each kids naps, and I can see that naps there are generally pretty bad. 

I've always had a lot of anxiety around my son's sleep, probably a relic from the baby stage, and I've always been really really protective about his naps. I get really worried at the idea that he might have bad naps 5 days a week, and wondering how that would translate to his naps on the weekends, and his nighttime sleep, and generally his mood and development throughout the rest of the day/week.

Ideally I'd like to extend the time he's at daycare so that I can get some things done, and have him take his nap there, but I'm terrified that if he fails to nap well at daycare it'll affect all his naps from here on, as well as his nighttime sleep and mood. What are your experiences with this? Is it possible for them to have crap naps during the week but good naps on the weekend? Did your kid drop their nap earlier than is ideal because of daycare?

My 2 Year old son going for autism diagnosis.,"Hey people, this is my very first post on this subredit. I am a father of 2 year 4 month old and a little nervous about going through an autism diagnosis here in Ontario, Canada. At 2 year old during regular visit, I went to his pediatrician when I told her he isn't still speaking alot and at the time I noticed he was pacing (walking in circles). 

During this pandemic both me and my wife are working from home and have decided to stop his daycare since he was falling sick twice with viral every month and we didnt want to take the risk of covid panic. So when both me and wife were in meeting for working, we started noticed he would get bored and start pacing.

That said, today, my son is able to speak more than 50 words (note we are bilingual) so he speaks a few words in our native and others mostly english. He doesnt yet speaks in sentences. The only sentence I remember him saying is ""daddy sit"". 

He loves sitting with a book and pointing things calling out names of things (sheep, cow, sun, apple etc). I cannot say numbers or letters yet. He points out to stuff he needs, he says ""stairs"" if he wants to go downstairs or upstairs. Loves his screen time watching rhymes but we limit that to some extent. I just hate the fact his development is most likely affected because we dont have enough time to spend with him and are scared to send him to daycare due to pandemic which I am debating now.

Yesterday, when we visited his ped for noticing white marks in his nail thinking maybe he has some deficiency (which we were told its nothing), our doctor was more focused on autism. Now what she was telling me was not staring at her when she was talking to my child combined with delayed speech are sign of autism. Of course, I am not in denial and I will go through with the diognosis but I am still questioning her method of her diagnosis. There was a nurse with whom my son was interacting, giving hi-fi when asked, he even spread his arms to take him in her arms and all while making eye contact (not litterally staring tho). 

At home, or places he is never shy. If anyone is being a little friendly and says ""outside"" he will be ready to hold you hands and walk out with you doesnt matter who you are. As a parent, I am genenuinely nervous about his development. His diagnosis is scheduled on 2nd October and I am really hoping it comes out he has nothing like that. 

I post this here to ask how were your kids at this age and what you think of this situation? Is it really that bad of 2 year old toddler not speaking and staring in your eyes if you talk to them etc.

Tantrums &amp; Breastfeeding,"Tantrums &amp; Breastfeeding


Good morning ,

So I have an almost 2.5 year old son who throws a tantrum for nearly anything lol. Yes , I’m aware this is what most children his age do but I would love to hear your way of approaching your child when they throw a tantrum. Normally when I tell him “No” about anything , he cries and lay on the ground throwing a tantrum. It seems as if it gets worse by the day unfortunately. Usually I tell him no over and over and it gets worse and worse . So I usually go to the “old school” approach and tap/spank him on his leg or pull up. I honestly don’t spank him a lot but i really do not want to whatsoever or make that be my last last resort. So I was curious to know of ways you usually stop your toddler from throwing a tantrum. In addition, he still breastfeeds for comfort and for
Him to sleep. Is not a huge issue however that’s the “quick fix” of calming him down or him going to sleep at night or taking a nap. Not to mention, my wife and I just had a baby 5 days ago and she’s breastfeeding as well. So any advice about ways of having toddler overcoming tantrum besides spanking would be greatly appreciated.

Penis Issues - Did my doctor hurt my son?,"My son is uncircumcised, and 14 months. This has repeated this at least 20 times in the past 2 days as hes been having swelling near the opening of his foreskin. We were told by a healthlink nurse to see our sons pediatrician, we called today and got an appointment with a female doctor who fills for his normal male pediatrician.

My boyfriend’s older brother and 2 1/2 year old son just moved in with him...,"Hi parents!

A little context before I bombard you with questions: My boyfriend's older brother and son (2 1/2 years old) just moved in with him. In the past month, my boyfriend has assumed the 'second parent' role that he wasn't necessarily prepared for. My boyfriend wanted to help out his brother in a time of transition and financial need. He's awesome with his nephew - gentle, kind, loves to play and teach him new things. He's spoken with his brother about boundaries, but still isn't quite sure where he lands on the 'uncle-parenting' spectrum. Currently, my boyfriend is working on potty training and expanding his nephew's very limited vocabulary (he has under 50 words and can't yet communicate when he needs to go to the bathroom which is making potty training difficult). I love them all and really just want to see their living situation be successful.

My questions are (any and all answers appreciated!):

* How can my partner set boundaries with his brother?
* How can I best support my partner?
* How did you encourage your toddler to speak?
* How do you know when to seek out a speech eval?
* Potty training - is it too soon to start?

Trouble with day care provider,"Ok, so I need to vent a little and could maybe use a bit of advice too. Im sorry if this gets really long, I’m just processing it all and really beating myself up. I’m struggling with my day care provider who for the most part I like, but she’s very old school and sometimes we don’t see eye to eye on certain things. 

I should probably preface by explaining that my daughter who is 3, is suspected to be on the spectrum or have ADHD and we’ve been in the process of having her evaluated but the process is taking for freaking ever. It’s been almost two years now since we started the process, it’s ridiculous. 

So anyway, my daughter goes to day care twice a week simply for the social aspect of it and our day care lady -let’s call her Judy- has commented on how my daughter should be doing certain things for her age. She should be using a regular cup at her age. She should be putting her shoes on correctly. She’s called her “flighty” because she likes to bounce from one activity to another. Whatever. These are things that I’ve tried working with her on but she has no interest so I don’t push it. However, I’m so very proud of her because after we have struggled with potty training for over a year now (and I didn’t want to push her), she is finally potty trained aside from while she’s sleeping or in the car. She does amazing and has even started going #2 on the toilet and I am SO proud of her. 

So recently, Judy has expressed frustrations about my daughter coming in to day care with a “saturated” (her exact words) pull up. So I cut back my daughters juice intake first thing in the morning to try and help with this. However, I like to make sure she has plenty to drink first thing in the morning before she goes to day care because I know she won’t get much to drink while she’s there because of the cup situation I mentioned previously. So, obviously.. she is wet by the time we get there but I wouldn’t call it saturated. 

Now, this is super confusing to my kiddo because any other day of the week, she doesn’t wear a pull up or diaper except at bed/nap time and in the car. But Judy says I can’t send her to day care without a pull up until she’s fully potty trained. My child doesn’t understand that a pull up is not actually a diaper. As long as she’s wearing it, she will pee in it. It’s that simple. Lately, the mornings that we go to day care, my kiddo says she wants to wear “shark undies” and I try to explain that she has to wear the pull up to go to day care but that she can still go potty on the toilet while she’s there. She gets upset because she doesn’t want to wear the pull up and this morning was upset when she wet her pull up as we were heading inside day care. 

So what am I supposed to do?? Judy wants her in a pull up while she’s there, but yet if she arrives in a wet pull up, Judy is annoyed. My daughter doesn’t need to go potty on the toilet first thing in the morning because she’s already gone in her diaper all night. It’s not until after she’s had her morning juice (which I have cut back on) that she needs to go potty which just so happens to be about the time we are in the car on the way to day care or right when we get there. Judy says she has kiddo sit on the toilet for up to three minutes at a time and she usually doesn’t go potty and just gets upset. Well yeah!!  She’s in a pull up so she’s going potty in that and no longer has to go so you’re just making her sit still on the toilet for three minutes which probably just feels like a time out at that point! I don’t know what to do here. I’ll also add that the only reason Judy even tries to have kiddo go on the toilet is because I was concerned about the number of pull ups I was having to send and asked if she was using the toilet while she was there. Judy said no, kiddo had no interest but that she could give it a try after I explained that kiddo is potty trained at home. I didn’t know that meant no opportunity to try without a pull up and having to sit on the toilet for several minutes. Because at home, she just goes in the bathroom and goes when she needs to go. She doesn’t even require any help from me unless she has pooped. 

Maybe I’m in the wrong, but I know my kid. She’s hard to communicate with sometimes because she doesn’t always understand directions but I always try anyway and she eventually catches on, it just takes her a tad longer than some kids and that’s ok. We work with her. 

Anyway! I’m so sorry for the ramble and if my thoughts seem scattered. I hope it all makes sense. I’m just feeling like a crappy mom because this lady makes me feel like there are so many things I’m doing wrong and now when I thought we had made great progress with something, it feels like it’s being taken away because it’s not enough or something. She makes me feel like my kid is “that kid” that she doesn’t like having around. But it also feels like she’s limiting my child because I know her abilities and she doesn’t get to express them while she’s there. So yeah. Any input or help would be appreciated because I feel kind of stuck right now.",1,"Trouble with day care provider Ok, so I need to vent a little and could maybe use a bit of advice too.

I don't know if I want to be amazed with our 2yr old escape artist or scream!,"I'm in the hospital right now having given birth to my 3rd child. So this is 2nd hand story.

I was induced 9/22 so my two girls were with the grandparents. My 4yr old with my parents and 2yr old with my MIL.

The 2yr old learned how to climb out of the crib the day she turned 17mths. Living with my MIL we were not prepared to switch her to a toddler bed though we tried. So we purchased a mesh crib tent where the mattress fits inside and you zip them in to prolong their time in the crib.

Yesterday during her nap time she somehow got out and came looking for grandma. She had no idea how she escaped.

My SO was able to go home last night and return today. He wanted to see how she escaped. 

So while he was in the shower this morning the 2yr old came into the bathroom. She had still been in the crib. He changed her diaper and put her back in so he could watch how she escaped.

The little sh$t unzipped the tent from the inside and climbed out. But she didn't stop there. She climbed back up and zipped the flap up. When she got to the end she couldn't get it all the way up so she planted a foot on the mattress and put her knee on the rail of the crib to completely zip it up!

Part of me is amazed but the other part is cursing 🤬 up a storm because now we have to deal with an escape artist as well as a newborn. We have baby gates on the bedroom doors as our rooms are connected by the bathroom.

She had no idea how she escaped.  My SO was able to go home last night and return today. He wanted to see how she escaped.   So while he was in the shower this morning the 2yr old came into the bathroom. She had still been in the crib. He changed her diaper and put her back in so he could watch how she escaped.  The little sh$t unzipped the tent from the inside and climbed out. But she didn't stop there. She climbed back up and zipped the flap up. When she got to the end she couldn't get it all the way up so she planted a foot on the mattress and put her knee on the rail of the crib to completely zip it up!  Part of me is amazed but the other part is cursing 🤬 up a storm because now we have to deal with an escape artist as well as a newborn. We have baby gates on the bedroom doors as our rooms are connected by the bathroom.   I was NOT ready to deal with this as we are about to bring baby brother home 😩.,77,17,1491,307,Rant/vent

Ask your child’s teacher how long they’ve been there?

Neither of these things necessarily effects your child’s care, they may be hiring good people but if those people don’t stay, then that’s a disruption in your child’s care.

Toddlers and Pools - Best safety alarm?,"It happened yesterday. What every parent fears, and those of us who have pools at our homes, that fear runs **deep**.

My toddler fell in our pool while we were cleaning the deck. Fortunately, we were right there and able to pull him out within 5 seconds of the fall, but it was still the scariest moment of our lives. We do swim lessons, swimming with and without the floaties, etc but he’s still not ready to swim on his own. We’ve sat him down and talked to him about how scary that was for everyone and why, etc...but what I really think we need is a pool safety alarm. 

I’ve found a couple online with mixed reviews. Does anyone have one that they love and would recommend?",1,"Toddlers and Pools - Best safety alarm? It happened yesterday.

Advice for getting your toddler to stop spitting out his drink?,So my 22 month old son has finally gotten the hang of a sippy cup (getting him to drink anything has been an ordeal).

"Parents, please if you can — put your child’s car seat in the middle. I was in a car accident yesterday and my toddler would’ve suffered severe injuries from the side/curtain airbag had he been in the car.","To start off: I am by no means a car safety expert. As an overly anxious parent however, I have done as much research as I can on car seat safety. I’ve watched manufacture videos of front/side/back collisions on my make and model of vehicle. I read both my owners manual and car seat manual for instillation and I always have my local health department double check the seat is installed correctly. I’m aware that none of this qualifies me as an expert, I’m still a layperson when it comes to knowledge about car safety. Always read your owners and car seat manuals to make sure the seat can be installed in the middle. This is just my personal antidote. I’m also aware that the middle seat might not always be possible, especially for those with multiple children. 

I’ve always had car seats in the middle, but since my two and a half year old moved to forward facing in my 2008 Honda CR-V, I decided to put him on the passengers side in the back because the anchor system in the middle seat requires the third anchor to be hooked on the ceiling instead of the back of the seat like most models allow for. I figured this would increase the likelihood the seat would loosen over time making me have to readjust/tighten it constantly, and that the belt would be in the way of my trunk space so I decided the side would be the best option.

Getting onto the accident: My significant other was driving and my toddler (THANK GOD) was staying at grandmas house for the weekend as we decided to take a much needed socially distanced trip just the two of us. A women in a mini van pulled out of a parking lot full force, impacting the back passenger side door (again, the door the car seat is at). The side/curtain airbags were deployed in both the front and back seat and the car spun around in the middle of the road, and it ended with us facing the direction we were coming from. 

My first thought was that my arm was broken. The side airbag hit it hard. Luckily I’m fine, we got X-rays. It’s just bruised and swollen today. My second thought was to look in the back seat. The curtain airbag did not hit the side of the car seat like I assumed it would (we all have those little head protectors that protect the sides of the head built into the seat), but instead came down from above and slightly to the side — right where my toddlers head would’ve been. The car seat would NOT of been between the airbag and his head in this case. As a nurse, nothing terrifies me more than pediatric traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure. And there’s no doubt in my mind we would’ve been life flighted to the nearest pediatric ICU for head trauma or a broken neck had he been on the car. I was so livid at this women. I was even more pissed off when she tried to blame her actions on a parked truck for blocking the view, but there’s a difference between inching out and pulling out full force. I understand things happen sometimes, but based on where she impacted us it’s clear we were right in front of her, I mean the front half of the car was passed her already. My car will likely be totaled.

Again, just my personal antidote. Ive always read middle is safest and it makes sense to me. I’ve also had my health department verify this. I’m trying not to kick myself over “what-if’s” but it’s hard not to when your child’s life could’ve been at stake. 

Some tips: 
-Car seats are deemed ineffective after being an accident. This is why it’s important not to purchase used car seats, as you never know if it’s been in one or not. I will be purchasing a new one. 

-Manufactures have videos of accident safety tests on your make/model available to the public. I believe there’s a government website I found this on (United States) but I do not remember the site name.

-Always read both the owners manual and seat manual for proper instructions for instillation. 

-See if your local health department has a car seat instillation program where someone who is trained will help you install your seat or check that it is installed correctly. 

I know we are all trying are best as parents so I hope this doesn’t worry anyone with multiple car seats or who can put on in the middle. If anyone has anything else to add about car safety, please feel free to do so! I’m always open to learning more.

Nighttime Potty Troubles..,"So, my daughter, B. She's 3 in January (2.5, 33 months, almost 3, etc) she is my 3rd and has been the WORST to potty train, but we are getting there. 

So she is doing this thing. Using her bed as her toilet. So, here is our saga... 

Our daughter does not nap, but likes to do all her sleeping at night. And she wakes up late morning, and then is sneaky quiet as she plays in her room. If I get her up RIGHT when she wants to get up she is a tantruming mess ALL DAY. Please know, I am not joking. She will literally have a non stop meltdown from the time she gets up, till she goes down, with breaks to eat, and breathe. So, I watch her the best I can pandemic schooling the 2 older brothers. 

And usually 30 or so min after she wakes, I can go get her. But she ALWAYS urinates on her bed/bedding by the time I get her. 30 min is how far I had widdled the time to. Her pedi is ok with her sleeping in since she doesn't nap (go me!) 

Hopefully you follow me. 

So, we began dressing her in clothes she can't get out of. She can undress herself. Backwards jammies be damned. She must have a gnome friend living in her doll house or something... idk man. She gets out of there. She escapes everything. 

We have placed an extra potty in there WITH this neat little potty bag that has an absorbent pad inside it. (I frankly don't trust her not to spill it, little potty has a locking top she hasn't figured out yet... but there is still time..... )

She goes potty in said potty, she uses it.. and THEN pees on her bedding. 

We have cut out sippys of water at night (all my kids have slept with water) and cut back the last sippy of water she gets (no juice or milk for her) so. By 10:30 am (when I get her) she gas not had any liquids since 6pm (the end of dinner) save the delicacy of soapy bath water- hork. She probably drinks a good half gallon of water a day from when she gets up, to dinner. 

We have changed diaper brands. 

We have thought about duct taping the diaper to her, but she has no hips so I don't think it would work (and that whole not acceptable thing) 

She is my 3rd so OBVIOUSLY she wants me to feel as clueless as a parent as possible for the last Harrah. So can anyone provide me with solidarity as I try and keep up with her laundry, advice from your own delicate defeating demon, or even someone explain to me WHY my only daughter has been the absolute WORST to potty train OR is this connected? 

(Oh, and because its relevant we began potty training her later than her brothers... but she began withholding when wearing diapers and causing herself other issues due to the discomfort of using her diaper. We STILL have withholding problems, however its more of an issue for us to get her to relax long enough- not she is too young to train) 

TLDR: my spawn absolutely fills her size 6 diaper to the BRIM with pee, pees in a potty with an absorbent pad, AND THEN pees on her bedding (usually she has drug it onto the floor- or straight up on her sheets)

3yo brother severely afraid of change?,"he’s not my brother, but a kid i’m super close with. 

basically what the title says, he is severely sensitive to change, to the point of triggering meltdowns where he’s screaming and crying until the change is reverted. 

for example, when he was at the age of using a pacifer, whenever it would be replaced with a new one(because the old one was too small or broken), he would have a meltdown and stay awake all night until he had the old pacifier back. 

another example is that when he would have new shoes or socks, he would refuse to wear them and insist on wearing the old shoes, no matter how small they were. 

today, his father bought new diapers for him (a different brand than normal), and he refused to wear them. he held his bladder for hours, and began crying because it was becoming painful to hold it in. eventually he was forced into the diaper, and he immediately peed and had another meltdown. 

i’i can’t take him to a neurologist or a doctor, we don’t have any money and his parents are a neglectful (they hit him when he cries, they don’t take care of him and leave him to the oldest brother to. they don’t play with him and let him play on a mobile phone to keep him busy. he rarely gets to go out, only when the brother takes him out does he get to) 

if this is important, he also doesn’t know how to speak yet (he can speak as well as a one year old). his brother says that he has always been anxious of everything (people, games, anything non-familiar). he hurts himself badly when he’s angry as well. 

has anybody dealt with a similar situation? if so, what was the problem? how did u deal with it? any advice would be very appreciated, i am just really worried and not sure where to start.",1,"3yo brother severely afraid of change? he’s not my brother, but a kid i’m super close with.   basically what the title says, he is severely sensitive to change, to the point of triggering meltdowns where he’s screaming and crying until the change is reverted.   for example, when he was at the age of using a pacifer, whenever it would be replaced with a new one(because the old one was too small or broken), he would have a meltdown and stay awake all night until he had the old pacifier back.   another example is that when he would have new shoes or socks, he would refuse to wear them and insist on wearing the old shoes, no matter how small they were.   today, his father bought new diapers for him (a different brand than normal), and he refused to wear them. he held his bladder for hours, and began crying because it was becoming painful to hold it in. eventually he was forced into the diaper, and he immediately peed and had another meltdown.   i’i can’t take him to a neurologist or a doctor, we don’t have any money and his parents are a neglectful (they hit him when he cries, they don’t take care of him and leave him to the oldest brother to. they don’t play with him and let him play on a mobile phone to keep him busy. he rarely gets to go out, only when the brother takes him out does he get to)   if this is important, he also doesn’t know how to speak yet (he can speak as well as a one year old). his brother says that he has always been anxious of everything (people, games, anything non-familiar). he hurts himself badly when he’s angry as well.   has anybody dealt with a similar situation? if so, what was the problem? how did u deal with it? any advice would be very appreciated, i am just really worried and not sure where to start.",38,6,1720,324,Question

3 year old with social anxiety,"My daughter turned 3 in July. She has always been a “shy” kid - pretty extremely. Even as a baby people couldn’t hold her or she would freak out.

She will not speak to anyone she does not know. If she does speak around them it’s at a very low mumble that is barely understandable.

"How much solo play is healthy for an almost-3yo, and how much is just neglectful?","Our almost-3yo spends a good amount of time every day playing on his own, or just going about his day alongside us while we do a combo of work, housework, and cooking. Every day I struggle with guilt/pride over it.

To give you an idea of the schedule:

- wake-up and breakfast are with me (mom), and then we usually head outside for a park visit or bike ride. If it's bad weather, we go to his room and do stickers/puzzles/train sets/whatever he's into.
- lunch around 12:30pm, and after that he does quiet time in his room on his own until about 3pm. He used to nap between 1-3pm, but he stopped sleeping - out of necessity/wanting that break (I do freelance part time work and try to cram a lot of it in that time frame).
- after quiet time, he hangs out with me doing books, maybe another outdoor jaunt, or some potty training/puzzles/stickers until dinner (~6pm)
- after dinner we usually get him to tidy his room, and then he can watch some TV or play on his tablet for ~45mins, then it's bath and bed by 8:30.

I guess I'm wondering how this compares to other only children who aren't in daycare. I'm proud that he seems happy and content while playing on his own, but I'm also feeling like his dad and I are being shitty parents and just tapping out early because we can.

Terrible? Good development? Should I chill out on the guilt feelings? I find myself needing a lot of recharge, and so does my husband (although I think I'm better at powering through).

If it weren't for Covid I'd have him in more activities, but it's just not a safe option for us right now.

Desperately seeking sleep.,"My 2.5 yo girl has never been a “great” sleeper, most days we’d consider it a win if she slept in past 6am. Nowadays, we are *lucky* if we sleep in past 5am. We got to a point of being so desperate that we hired a sleep consultant. She advised we do the following (and I want to note that we have stuck to this for the most part, without any success):

Put LO in toddler bed at 7:30 after routine.  

Say “it’s sleepy time” give her a kiss and leave.   

First through third time she gets out of bed, put her back in bed and say sleepy time phrase, leave immediately.   

Fourth time and beyond, put her in bed without speaking.   

Same as above for any wakings through the night.   

If she gets up before 5am, put her back in bed and repeat above steps until her “okay to wake” clock turns green.

If she does sleep in bed quietly until okay to wake clock turns green, give her a “special treat” (cookies, fruit tape, etc).


Okay so basically... none of this has worked. She doesn’t care about the treats. She wants us to rub her back or rock her to sleep every night or else all hell breaks loose and bedtime takes an hour or longer. 

My SO and I are the most upset about the 4:30/5am wake ups. If neither the putting her back in bed nor treats aren’t working, what can we possibly do?!

Thanks.",1,"Desperately seeking sleep. My 2.yo girl has never been a “great” sleeper, most days we’d consider it a win if she slept in past 6am. Nowadays, we are *lucky* if we sleep in past 5am.

Hope for everyone dealing with a needy young toddler!,"I wanted to share this because sometimes when you're in the middle of toddlerhood it seems like it'll never change or get better but it does! My 4 year old has always been VERY clingy and needy, and has ALWAYS managed to deprive us of sleep in one way or another from birth onward. We love her to bits and try to just roll with the punches as much as we can but it definitely gets trying at times when you're exhausted and she's woken up super early for the 10th day in a row, etc. 

Lately, though, she's been sleeping pretty reliably and this morning I woke up naturally, which is unheard of as there's always a whining toddler as my alarm. I checked the clock and it was a full 30 minutes past even her latest usual wake up time. Had she slept in? I opened the door to go check on her and found her sitting on the couch with a bunch of stuffed animals, quietly watching a cartoon on TV! I asked her if everything was okay and she said, ""Yes, I just thought I would let you sleep for a little while."" OMG, I nearly fainted from shock. Seriously. I've made sure to thank her repeatedly for being so kind and considerate. I don't expect it to become a regular thing but it was so encouraging!! She's getting so big and independent, I can't believe it!",1,"Hope for everyone dealing with a needy young toddler!

Strange vomiting pattern in almost 4 year old,"Hello reddit moms and dads - turning to you all in hopes of finding some guidance and ideas here.   My daughter caught what we believed to be your proto-typical gastroenteritis virus about 4 weeks ago.  She had typical symptoms for 3 nights (vomiting, diarrhea, no fever) and recovered thereafter.  She went on for about 5 days without any symptoms at all and then had a recurrence of vomiting overnight.  This has gone on for the last month or so during which she will be completely fine for days at a time, then out of nowhere will throw up one night and the pattern will repeat (it has occurred 6 separate times now in the last 30 or so days).  I do want to note that she is acting completely 100% normal and energetic outside of these vomiting episodes.  Also, to clarify on the vomiting - she is spitting up very little food and mostly bile / saliva and each time that she has thrown up, it has happened overnight between 3 and 5 AM (leading me to believe this may be reflux or nausea at play).   With all that said, she has been examined by her doctor and all of her labs came back 100% normal.  Doctors at this point believe she could be constipated and needing to clear her system - we are monitoring her and she does a follow up visit in the next week.  We are really at a loss here and hoping to gain some guidance from parents who have been through similar issues with their kids - thanks to all in advance!",1,"Strange vomiting pattern in almost year old Hello reddit moms and dads - turning to you all in hopes of finding some guidance and ideas here.

How to deal with climbing toddler and couches?,"My son, almost 16 months, has figured out how to climb up onto the couch as well as a low coffee table. I'm not sure how to handle this.

Help! How to sleep train without the CIO method?,"Hi all!! I'm looking for some advice from like minded parents. 
I HATE the cry it out method. Im really sensitive to my crying babies and find it super stressful.

I now have a nearly 1 year old boy who I have to stop co sleeping with (due to medical limitations i can't currently pick him up at all which is really hard) and my husband has had to take over his sleep routine. 
Oh... my.. God.... his methods are so harsh! The goal is to get our son to sleep in his cot for the night, without a feed. But my husband is all for the cry it out method and its breaking my heart.
So here is where I need help. Has anyone got some tips for how my hubby can do this in a softer manner? And that I can take over eventually.

2.5 y/o... 1) sleeps late on nap-days should we drop it? and 2) HOW the hell do I gently wean a co-sleeping toddler?,"Title says all.

On nap days, regardless of how early in the day it ended or how short it was, she sleeps late AF. Like 11pm late. When we skip her nap she goes down at a reasonable time (8ish). Sometimes she naps for 2.5 hours so I'm hesitant to drop it but damn I am so over these late nights.

  
Also, how the hell do I wean her? She only nurses at wake-up (to go back to sleep) and for nap and bedtime. I honestly don't know how to get her to sleep any other way. Her dad is only here on weekends and when he tries to put her down she flips out and he gives in by letting her watch a video on his phone (he says it's the only way she calms down). 

I feel like it's harder since we co-sleep. (Is it?) I've tried getting her a new fancy cup and talked to her about it but we've had no luck. In fact, when I gave her the cup I told her it was only for bedtime and no more boob-boob and she excitedly said YES no more boob-boob! Unfortunately it didn't mean shit.

Any advice re nap times and bedtime for my 14mo?!,"It’s like my son has forgotten how to go to sleep. Nap times were beautiful before we moved house. I put him down and left the room and he’d be asleep within ten mins. 

We moved to temporary accommodation a month ago while we buy our next house. I decided to sit in the room with him while he went to sleep otherwise he would have been scared to be alone in the new room. Well a month later I’m still sitting here, except he will no longer go to sleep. If I ever try to leave he will become absolutely hysterical and I’m not prepared to leave him like that for long. 

I’ve tried putting him on 1 nap, which he goes to sleep for because he’s so tired but he’s waking up very upset after 40 mins and not going back to sleep. He will flat out not have a second nap even though he is so tired. 

Since we got back from holiday a week ago he won’t do bedtime either, just screams staring at me so I eventually give him another bottle of milk to reset him. After sometimes 3 or 4 goes on the bottle he’s eventually tired himself out enough to go to sleep. Maybe he’s overtired cause usually he’s been awake 6+ hours at this point because of missed naps. 

Up until this point I’ve been all about counting wake times, but I haven’t got a clue what they should be anymore as he’s not seeming to follow any of them. It also doesn’t help that I have no idea what time he wakes up in the morning as he lies there quietly for over an hour if left. 

Please help and give any advice you have, I’m at my wits end with it all. I’m trying my hardest even if I am doing it wrong so no judgement please... thank you. Posting here rather than a more baby focused sub as I find people with 6 month old good sleepers give advice when I think age appropriate advice and experience is helpful in this case.

Potty training questions,"So my 3.5 year old step daughter (I don’t have any bio kids so please be kind, I’m doing my best) is what I would consider mostly potty trained. The biggest issue right now is that she refuses to go to the potty by herself. She is great about telling us that she has to go, but she will not go by herself. At first it wasn’t really an issue and we assumed she’d grow out of it, but it’s been like 3 months since she’s been fully daytime potty trained and she still won’t. How do I break her of this? It’s not like I can straight up refuse to go with her and let her have an accident. She’s an anxious child and I think she’s just worried to go alone, but I don’t know how to solve that. Is that normal at her age? Do they grow out of that? 

Also, and this may be TMI, at what age are children supposed to wipe themselves? She has absolutely no desire to do that. She also doesn’t want her bio parents or anyone else to help (which I can understand, those are private parts). If she had her way, she’d do her business, pull her pants up and go, saving the earth one roll of TP at a time. We’ve tried the sticker chart and positive reinforcement, we’ve tried telling her she can’t get up until she does it, but she just doesn’t want any part in that.

She baffled us last night,"We tried, unsuccessfully, over the summer to potty train.  She was successful a handful of times and she really seemed ready, but after about a week, it was clear she wasn’t interested.  We decided to wait until October to try again so she could settle back into the routine of going to daycare while I start back up at work (I’m a teacher, so she’s been home with me since March because of COVID and summer break).

Last night, we put her in the tub, which she loves, and she immediately said she had to pee and wanted to go on the potty.  I was surprised, but I figured she was seeing other kids at daycare go so she was finally becoming interested in the potty.  So I pulled her out of the tub and sat her on her training potty.  Within 20 seconds she peed.  Dad and I celebrated, she got her sticker, and she was super happy.

BUT THEN...just a mere 10 seconds later, her smile turned to a full blown, open-mouthed, red face, teary-eyed wail.  She was crying, super upset, and we still have absolutely no idea why.  She was inconsolable.  We tried everything, and she didn’t want to get back in the tub, either.  This girl NEVER has meltdowns like that.  She’s very even-tempered and wel-behaved...for a toddler at least. 

She is cutting one or two of her two-year molars, so maybe that has something to do with it.  But I honestly have no idea what happened.

13 month old waking through the night,"Our 13 month old has always been a pretty good sleeper. It was ruined through the 8-9 month regression by the time we got to 11 months we completely overhauled our sleep routine and we we were back to 12 hour nights.

I dont think its an amount of sleep problem. But she is beside herself if she is in the cot. Fine if we pick her up to cuddle. But if we either sit in her room cuddling to settle if she goes ba k to sleep she is screaming again as soon as we put her back in the cot.

Overall its only a couple times a week so not a huge drama but i just wanted some other opinions on why this is happening.",37,7,995,204,Question
2yo terrified of reflections,"For the last few days, my 2yo son has suddenly broken out in an extreme panic, crying and shaking as soon as it gets dark (inside the house). Took us a day to realize, but it seems he’s spooked by his / anyone’s reflections in the windows and glass panes of picture frames on the walls. I get it, I mean, when it gets dark, if you don’t know what you’re looking at through the window, it can be scary. 

So we tried explaining to him that it’s his reflection, turning the lights on and off, showing him his reflection in a mirror (which he seemed ok with all this time, until last night suddenly he freaked out in front of a mirror for the first time.) But it’s been a few days now, and it only feels like the panic is getting worse. 

So I’m wondering is this a typical thing for kids this age? I feel really bad seeing him so scared and naturally want to help him. But I don’t know if this is something we should just wait for him to outgrow, or if it could be a sign of something more serious? He’s otherwise not a nervous kid, so this strikes me as odd for him.

Any advice is appreciated - thank you!",1,"2yo terrified of reflections For the last few days, my 2yo son has suddenly broken out in an extreme panic, crying and shaking as soon as it gets dark (inside the house).

My grandma’s identical twin inadvertently confuses and upsets my 2 year old nephew,"My nephew spends a couple days a week at his great grandma’s house (my grandma). Every so often—not right now—my grandma’s identical twin sister comes to visit while he’s there. 

This confuses him a lot, and he gets very upset about it.

My great aunt understands that it’s confusing for him, but she can’t help but feel a little sad that he’s so upset about her every time he sees her.

Toddler screaming - advice?,"Hi all, so my 20 month old had started daycare about 2 weeks ago, but since then there have been two situations I'm not sure how to handle/no idea what's going on. Is love any thoughts you all might have.

1. We went through the usual tough drop offs (lots of screaming) but she's now usually happy to go to daycare in the morning. The tough part now is picking her up. She apparently throws a huge tantrum when I or any other parent arrives to do pick up (me for her, or other parents for their own kids). Neither daycare nor I can figure out what's going on our house to get her to be calm when she sees a car pull into the driveway.

2. She's been sleeping through the night now for several months with an occasional wake up for a drink of water or to pass gas. Now though she's waking up almost inconsolable like 7-8 times a night. No signs of being sick, not sure what's going on.

I feel like a sh*t mom,"For yelling at my toddler last night. I yelled his name right in his face, and he immediately crumpled and started crying. He came right to me for a hug and I said I was so sorry, that is not okay for me to yell, and I hugged him tight. But the guilt is killing me and I feel like a monster.

Backstory leading up to it: 

He was following me around the house, screaming at the top of his lungs. He tends to do this for the first couple nights right before bedtime, after his dad leaves (my husband works out of town for a week at a time). I know my little one is having big feelings about dad being gone again, but good grief child, please stop screaming as loud as you can and following me around the house while you do it!! 

I try saying things like “Please stop screaming, that hurts my ears” several times with no luck. Then I get down on his level, and say things like “I need you to stop screaming now, I’m starting to feel upset” and ultimately getting to “I need to leave you here right now because I feel very upset by this screaming” and I leave the room to take some deep breaths. But that little bugger opens the door and FOLLOWS me, screaming his head off. When I look at his face, it’s like he knows exactly what he’s doing. He stops to listen when I say those things and then just start screaming again!

And so the third time he followed me into another room, I snapped and knelt down and yelled “Henry Oliver!!” right at him. 

I was screamed at by my father a lot growing up and I know that getting screamed at is a big trigger for me. I immediately start getting panicky when anyone yells at me (thankfully that hasn’t been very often until this toddler behaviour has cropped up). I’m very dedicated to breaking the cycle of trauma in my family and NOT yelling at my kids, so I feel extra bad about this incident. I’m working with my therapist on this, but holy smokes, I just want to know I’m not the only one who has snapped like this? Anyone??",1,"I feel like a sh*t mom For yelling at my toddler last night.

If you're looking for a fight organizer than a toddler is for you!,"So today I woke up with a headache. I took some Tylenol and wanted my toddler to play in bed quietly with me while I laid down for a few more minutes.

He doesn't know how to use it at all, he just likes to push the buttons. So I gave him my phone to play with while I laid down, figuring no big deal. About 3 minutes go by and I check his progress.

My pinned location, 
a twat gif, and the same twat gif again

2yo pushing husband away more and more,"Our 2yo son responds “no” when his papa says “good morning!” almost every morning. He also sometimes pushes him away at bedtime. The rest of the day they play and cuddle for the most part. Sure he wants mama more often, but they’re good buddies. 

At first we thought it was cute and funny, but now my husband is starting to feel rejected and getting a little emotional about it. During the week, they get such little time together in the morning before he takes him to daycare - so this can kick off my husband’s day with a sour note. What we can’t figure out is what is causing it.

So I started ending my work day early on his days off so we could do fun family activities. Our lil dude would get so excited and his mood improved quickly. But he still pushed his papa away in the morning and evenings. 

I’ve tried giving my husband hugs and kisses in front of him in the morning. I’ve tried making it a game to “go get papa”. The only thing we haven’t tried lately is having him get him in the morning - mostly because I wake up early and sometimes he doesn’t hear us get up until our monster makes a bunch of noise - playing his recorder or crashing his cars or whatever a 2yo boy can find to be loud lol. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. We’ve been telling ourselves it’s an Oedipus thing, but that doesn’t make my husband feel better. Any ideas how to “fix” this or is it just a normal phase? What else can my husband do?",1,"2yo pushing husband away more and more Our 2yo son responds “no” when his papa says “good morning!” almost every morning. He also sometimes pushes him away at bedtime. The rest of the day they play and cuddle for the most part. Sure he wants mama more often, but they’re good buddies.   At first we thought it was cute and funny, but now my husband is starting to feel rejected and getting a little emotional about it. During the week, they get such little time together in the morning before he takes him to daycare - so this can kick off my husband’s day with a sour note.

Need help finding that disney dress company,"They had probably 50+ styles of character dresses including disney, marvel, harry potter, and more.

Help! Normally good sleeper waking multiple times looking for toy in bed,"We recently had a baby (one month ago). My toddler has been a good sleeper but today she has been waking up multiple times at night crying and crying at naptime because she took a toy with her to bed and suddenly can’t find it in the bed. Yes, I know, we shouldn’t let her take smaller toys into bed (it’s a cardboard piece from a board game). 

My question is how do I negotiate with her? I tried telling her that I will keep the piece safe for her for the morning but she just woke up and cried for it anyway saying she wanted it in the crib. It’s day one of this and against my better judgment I gave in and gave it to her. She’s been up twice since then.

How do I reason with her or explain it to her and nip this in the bud? My newborn wakes up every 1-2 hrs at night so between him and her, it’s been a pretty miserable night.

"Sleep help, PLEASE","I have an almost 2.5 year old son (will be 3 in December), who is an absolute doll majority of the time... except when it comes to bedtime. It takes 1.5-2hrs to get him down sometimes and it’s EXHAUSTING. He doesn’t pull this stunt during nap time, he goes down fairly quickly for that. My husband and I try hard to stick to a regular routine. Dinner, ideally some quiet time, milk, teeth brushing, potty, get pull ups on, read books/tell stories, turn on Hatch (white noise machine) then bed. He’s already in a big boy bed, so he can get out whenever he wants and he’s definitely been doing this more and more. He usually shrieks, cries and throws a fit as soon as my husband and I leave the room then eventually comes running back out after us. He always wants us to tell him another story, but one is never enough. We’ve tried eliminating stories altogether, letting him cry it out for a bit in his room (but then I always feel sickeningly guilty letting my 2.5 year old sob himself to sleep), we’ve tried talking about his feelings and explaining why mommy/daddy need to leave the room for bedtime, we’ve laid next to him until he falls asleep, we’ve tried leaving his door open all the way, cracked and closed, we’ve tried to let him read books to entertain himself until he crashes etc. We’ve tried a ton of things and nothing appeases him. He continues to hoot and holler like a wild animal once we leave. We’re feeling defeated. We get frustrated, not only with him but with each other. My husband is working full time and from home due to COVID. He starts a new MBA program in a week or so. I’m pursuing a nursing degree and a full time mom. We just moved into a new home at the end of August. We also have a 4 month old who can be very demanding, especially for me since I exclusively breastfeed. This leaves me feeling guilty because a lot of the time my husband is dealing with our son during the night time routine while I’m dealing with our daughter.

Mealtimes are stressful,My son is 14 months old and when he turned 1 he became a not so great eater.

His doctor said stop giving his safe foods and if he doesn’t eat then he doesn’t eat.

Tips for getting toddler in a bike seat and wearing a helmet?,"Just wondering if anyone has any tips? My son is 2, we've got ourselves bikes and a WeeRide front seat and forgot to factor in that our son is apparently scared of bikes and he has always hated having his hair messed with, drying his hair has been a cause of Great Upset ever since we started giving him baths.

I live in a suburb in a fairly rural UK town and don't drive, so getting a bike is the only way I can take him outside of our very boring suburban bubble and start trying to get back to some kind of normal since lockdown. Pre-lockdown, we lived in the middle of a small town, so I'd go to the library and just enjoy hanging out with my son in a cafe 2-3 times a week, would like to at least go back to those two activities if I can actually get him in a helmet and on a bike.

We've tried explaining, we even got him a balance bike, but because we tried to get him to wear a helmet on the balance bike, he won't touch it. The hair thing, we've tried everything we can think of and the things that have worked have worked for one evening (getting him to dry his hair, singing silly songs, making silly noises every time the towel touches him, hairdryer), then it's not worked the next. He just hates his hair being messed with.

He also won't sit in the seat, not if it's off the bike or on the bike. I got him on my lap on the bike, but that's it. Trying to do that every day to get him used to the idea, but he completely refuses to go in the seat.

Need help. 3 year old hitting at school,"Hey parents. Love this community haven't posted much but I search everything!

Girl is 3 next week. Daycare since age 1. She's super sweet at home. Any behaviour issues have been manageable by mommy &amp; daddy.

I'm having trouble lately when I find out she is hitting her friend at school. Daughter admits to us and says on her own accord she was hitting her friend, we'll call him Samuel. She says Samuel cried and cried because she hit him. Lots. I asked if teacher had a talk with her after and she says yea.

I feel like I do know when my daughter is fibbing or telling the truth. She says no pretty firm when I ask about something and it's a no. I know how to ask to get some responses and piece together the rest, you all know.

Anyway, I asked one teacher, Sandi, about it, her favorite teacher, she said Samuel went to teacher Sandi crying after he got hit. Sandi said there was no issues yesterday no hitting or crying.

So I don't know who to believe. I usually communicate issues directly to the director of the center. The week before my daughter didn't want to go to school one day. When I queried her she said teacher was calling her naughty and she was really sad saying ""I didn't hit Samuel!"" We stayed home and I told the director she had a bad day. He just had to call and know why I told him ""someone"" called her naughty, maybe another kid? He looked into it and she was jumping on the couch and got talked to.

Anyway, TL:DR-  Mostly what can I do at home to stop her jumping on the furniture and hitting kids at school?

She clams up and doesn't want to reveal much about these incidents. I try to put it delicately without prying or judging of course. Frustrating time, she communicates well but how much of it is reliable hah. Thanks everyone for reading.",1,"Need help. year old hitting at school Hey parents.

Tantrums, pee all over the floors and blankets multiple times, fighting, not listening. So many tears and little time outs. 
Googling ""is it normal for my 2.5 year old to be rough with the animals"" after he chased the cat with a yoga mat on his arm trying to crush her, and used a wooden truck to play crash to pass with the small dog.
Endless attempts at patience, slowly and softly explaining that animals have feelings, asking after two minutes ""do you know why you got put in a time out"" to make it a learning experience. So many hugs with shrill screams in my ears.

Starting potty training,"Hey everyone! 
I’m a first time mom to one son that’s is 1yr&amp;7mos,  is it a good time to start? How should I introduce it? How did you start your little one on their PT journey?

Accident prone 20mo. Normal?,"Despite our best efforts at child proofing, my active, curious 20mo boy gets minor injuries all the time.

Outside alone?,"Would you let your 3 year old play in the backyard alone?

My 3 year old has really taken an interest in playing house with her baby dolls. She loves to play in her outdoor playhouse feeding her babies their pretend food and talking to them. 

Our yard is fully fenced in with wood privacy panels. It is directly off of our kitchen. With the back door and kitchen windows open I can easily see and hear her. 

I always sit outside with her but she has no interest in playing with me. I usually browse reddit or read while I’m outside with her. 

Would it be responsible/safe if I went inside to wash dishes or tidy the kitchen?

Thee year old doesn’t make eye contact,"My three year old girl doesn’t make eye contact, and when I ask her to, she looks in my eyes for a few seconds and looks away. 

I have researched early signs of autism extensively and it doesn’t seem like she’s on the spectrum as she doesn’t have many other symptoms of it. 

About her:
- We’ve been monitoring the eye contact thing since she was two, she’s always had trouble with it 
-she’s very verbal and pretty articulate for her age
-she socializes pretty well with other kids at daycare and with our friends kids
-she talks about her feelings
-she can identify when I’m happy, angry and sad and can identify these emotions in others and in TV

My husband and I do feel that she does have trouble listening to instructions, getting ready to leave the house is often a big struggle. This could be typical 3 year old behaviour though.

3 year old struggling with new preschool,"My daughter has been in daycare since 12 weeks of age (with the exception of a few months during COVID).

Shoving kids, taking toys away, screaming at the babysitter (all out of character). Today she didn’t even go to preschool and the entire evening she was home was horrible. Massive tantrums over everything. Insane outbursts. She has started crying at night before bed and begs us, “please can I stay home tomorrow?” It is heart wrenching. I do not know what to do.

No nap at transitional preschool,"We started our 20 month old back in full time daycare in July. He was going back to his old place which was fine but I didn’t love because they didn’t communicate well with parents. Right as we reenrolled him I got a call from a transitional preschool that said they were willing to take him starting in September even though he was under the age requirement of 2.3 years. He started at his new place last week and seems to be enjoying it, although who knows since this place also doesn’t communicate well and he can’t tell us too much since he’s just learning to talk. But they can’t get him to nap. Which is odd since at home and his other daycare you hand him a pacifier and he puts himself down usually for 1.5-2.5 hours. No problem. But this place seems ill equipped for this... for example I just found out that they ordered a sound machine but it still hasn’t arrived which tells me they never had kids napping there before. And a few days a week he’s the only kid in their extended care program meaning everyone else leaves at 12:15. He’s very good so apparently he just lays on his mat for an hour quietly. I’m just so confused as to why they would accept him if they weren’t prepared to work with a kid under 2? And now I’m freaking out because I work full time and need the 8:30-5 care. I completely regret pulling him from his last daycare where he was napping two hours a day with no issues but we’re paid at this one through December and there are no refunds. And it’s EXPENSIVE. I think teachers deal with a lot but I almost want to be like guys you agreed to do this for a substantial charge so you need to try harder here. He has to nap. He’s too little not to.

Disappointed with speech therapy :( (19 months),"I've been pursuing speech therapy since my son was 16m and he just turned 19m old. He had his first group therapy session today and, surprise surprise! They seem to have put him in a 2+ group. The kids sat around a table and casually answered open ended questions, sipping on open cups and aside from a music part and puzzle part my son was a terror. He wouldn't listen to instruction or sit in the chair, and was much less engaged and more wriggly than usual. He didn't understand what was expected of him and was stressed out to the point of consistent fussing, which he usually doesn't do. I thought group therapy for a delayed 19 month old would be more like a musical circle time or reading time with a visual focus and more physical activities focusing on things like clapping, ""up"", where's your belly button, maybe ""touch your toes"", etc... a higher energy environment as opposed to sitting around a table quietly making small talk. I told them my son will just be a disruption in that environment and he needs the 1-on-1 therapy. I'm so nervous now wondering if my son has learning disabilities. What have your experiences been with speech therapy?

4 year old keeps retreating to his bed and lying around kind of withdrawn.,"I know 4 years isn’t a toddler but this kid is a little behind in speech and more like a toddler in some ways.

Question about Cocomelon,"I wanted to ask if anyone has had issues with their kids watching and *over-loving* Cocomelon. 

We randomly started watching Cocomelon videos with our toddler as an example of some nursery rhymes, and he decidedly loved them. The problem that we noticed is that, after turning them off, our toddler starts to become upset. It isn't tantrum level, but his mood does change. 

We don't even have to watch the videos; he gets the same reaction from listening to the Cocomelon songs on Spotify. Watching something like Sesame Street does not give him the same reaction as Cocomelon.

Our toddler loves music, but he does not form full sentences yet, so we cannot reason with him for moderation. Currently, we are not letting him watch them, but I wonder if it isn't so bad (I remember kids being obsessed with Barney in the 90s).

Carseat cleaning,"I don’t think this breaks the rules as I’m not actually offering this service/promoting myself but if so, please delete. 

Yesterday I was disassembling my child’s carseat so that I could thoroughly clean it (strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions of course, so as not to compromise the safety/integrity of the seat). I’ve done this countless times with her car seats, as well as strollers and other bulky baby gear. I’m not a clean freak by any stretch but I actually really enjoy cleaning these things- they are usually full of hidden grossness lurking in the nooks and crannies, absorbed into the padding, etc. Call me gnarly, but I like seeing all that nastiness come out and cleaning it up. I also know many parents never do this job themselves bc it’s labor intensive or they don’t have the time or stomach for it, whatever. 

Is this a service you would pay for? If so, how much would you be willing to pay? I’m not talking just vacuuming up the surface crumbs and spot cleaning, I mean fully removing the covers and cleaning them as thoroughly as the manufacturer allows, etc.",1,"Carseat cleaning I don’t think this breaks the rules as I’m not actually offering this service/promoting myself but if so, please delete.

2 year old whimpering in sleep,"Little Dude turned 2 at the end of August.
Like the title says- every night I can hear him through the monitor whimpering or crying a little- once in a while he says “no no no no” but mostly it’s whimpering- not a full on cry.
Every time it happens I sneak in there and gently pat his back (not pick up) a few times and reassure him he’s ok- then he falls back asleep either for the night, or he’ll do it another 1-2 times. These “awakening” happen anywhere between 12am-4am.

Tonight’s example: asleep by 820pm, whimpered at 230am but he only did it once and he was asleep when I checked the cam, whimpered again at 310am but this time I had to go in and pat his back and reassure him- he rolled around a few times and went back to sleep.

Are these night terrors? Nightmares? Should I not go in when this happens?? Making sure I’m helping him the best I can :)

PSA: be careful playing with “magic”!,"My little girl loves princess dresses (she was 3 yrs old at the time of this story). For a surprise, we got her a princess dress and we were waiting for a good time to give it to her. One evening she was playing Cinderella with a magic wand and said she wished she had a princess dress like the fairy godmother makes Cinderella.

For fun (and without thinking), I told her to say the magic words (Bibbity Bobbity bo) and close your eyes. Then, i brought out the dress and said it was “magic”. 

O boy. Big mistake. She loved the dress! But then she proceeded to say the magic words for more things (a carriage, for example) and was genuinely heart broken when the wand didn’t work. Saying, “Oh no! It’s not working! Mommy can you fix it?”

And now I felt CRUSHED having to now explain to her that magic was just pretend. I just wanted to play with her and allow her a sense of magical wonder. 😭 Anyway, don’t be like me. I feel terrible and so stupid like I should have saw this coming. 

TLDR: Be careful playing with “magic” and don’t use “magic” to give gifts. You may be forced into a position where you have to crush their dreams with unfortunate reality.",1,"PSA: be careful playing with “magic”!

yet another potty training/poop post - I am on the verge of tears,"Daughter just turned three.  We have been at it for about three months.   Wish I would have started sooner and now Oh Crap method is in my head that I am totally up shit creek (no pun intended).   Same story - will pee in the potty with no accidents but refuses to poop on the potty. 

I am spending 5-8 hours on a Saturday never letting her leave my sight. She is so sneaky, and not even wait till the obvious nap time. Today I made her walk to the door to ""help"" me sign for pizza as not to take my eyes off her.  I close the door and she was standing behind it and said ""I pooped"" - she even self-shames or talks about how gross it is.  When we are in the bathroom, I tried books, ipads, consoling her, nothing.  She will refuse and we get down and as soon as we have washed hands - pooped in her pants.  

Sadly, we have tried everything from praise, leveling with her, rewards, bribes, and even serious tones about how it isn't nice to hide and poop and make someone else clean your dirty undies.  I am not just a jerk parent - she GETS it.  She talks about how big she is and how it's not a good thing to poop in her pants..and yet here we are every. single. day.  Not one day in the last 4 months has she had clean undies.   

I am at a complete loss as to what to do.  She gets 100% of my supervision at home and I am beyond frustrated with it.  I am also exhausted.  I would revert back to pull ups and ""back off"" but she is isnt younger, like 18m...I believe she is smart and say she knows - so why won't she do it??

Potty training progress woes/question,"Hi, I posted last weekend when we were starting our potty training journey for our 25mo girl. We are using the oh crap method and are now just over a week in. 


She is at the stage now where she will go pee on the potty when prompted, but not unprompted. She has gone poo in the potty a few times when prompted, but mainly accidents still for poop. We can leave the house in pants/commando and she generally holds it fine. 


My concern is, we are still having at least 1 accident per day. And sometimes the accidents are beyond frustrating and seem completely unnecessary. For example, 2 days ago she used the potty to go pee just fine in the morning, and then 10 mins later peed in her pants out of nowhere. And for some reason after she woke up from her nap today, she is on a full-on potty strike. Will sit on the potty but REFUSES to go, and had one giant accident because of it. 


Is this normal for 9 days in? Many people I ask will immediately jump to “are you sure she’s ready?” And that isnt a helpful question because yes I’m pretty sure she’s ready. I put in all this work, I don’t want to throw in the towel already. But I just wonder if I’m doing something wrong so any tweaks or helpful hints would be appreciated. Or if this is completely normal, I’d like to know that too.

“Hi, I’m Declan and this is mummy and daddy! Want to see me tip all these letters into this hole?”

*pause*

“No! That would be silly!” And he cackles away.

Please help. Really struggling with 2 3/4 yr and 1 1/2 year old. Sibling rivalry and mom that isn't a great mom.,"I need help. I feel like I'm ultimately just at an awkward age right now... My daughter ""X"" is 2 3/4 (3 in November) and my son ""Y"" is 1 1/2. They're exactly 15 months and 1 day apart...

My son is at that horrible age where they don't know how to play, and they only grab/take everything from another kid. In general I'd consider my son mischievous and annoying. (Sorry.) Let me start by saying my daughter (my first) was a HORRIBLE baby. Screamed ALL the time, and couldn't sleep without being held. But turned out to be an outstanding toddler. She would always listen to me if I told her not to touch something, she would always follow me in public, I never had to worry about ""corralling"" her or watching where she was. She would always stay by me in public, do whatever was said and still does. 

My son is the opposite. He was a super easy baby, barely cried and would sleep when you put him in the crib within minutes. But he seems to be a troublesome toddler. I have to watch him in public or he'll run away, hates holding hands, if I tell him to stop touching something and even move his hand away from it, he'll put his hand right back and stare at me while doing it.

I have no idea what to do... I just moved to a new city and now I have both kids more often instead of just one or the other. IT'S HORRIBLE. 

Anytime my daughter tries to play with a toy my son is crowding her and grabbing her toys ASAP. I can understand her frustration. At the beginning she was a lot more patient with him, but I've been here a month now and now even if my son ""Y"" is in her presence she is yelling ""GO AWAY!!"" Pushing him, kicking him, telling him to ""go see Daddy"" and throwing him to the floor. Even when he's not doing anything, and just in her general presence. 

I've tried telling my daughter a million times, ""be nice"" ""don't push/kick your brother"" ""stop"" ""it's not nice"" but that seems to be the only subject she won't listen to me in. I don't entirely blame her because I can see how her brother is annoying as shit towards her. (He annoys the crap out of me too.) 

I don't have anybody to learn from... My parents were extremely abusive, and my ex/father of kids has no parents either, and only learns new things when I do myself. So I feel like I'm alone on the learning subject. 

I tried googling how to help but it only mentions ""rewarding good behaviour from the eldest."" But my daughter doesn't really ever show nice playing with him. Ever. It's hard to find the time to teach them to play together because I'm cooking them their meals, keeping the place clean, and taking them out to parks during the day. I don't usually get home to sit down with them unless I'm alone with one of them, one-on-one.

I say lots of positive things with my daughter, ""good job going pee!"" ""Nice waiting at the slide!"" ""Great colouring!"" Everything! She gets lots of praise and attention. They both gets lots of attention...

I really hate being a mom right now and I'm so tired of my son constantly hiding behind me from his sister, and my daughter constantly crying and whining because she can't do anything without him pestering her... (I've tried separating them too, but it just makes my son cry) I wish my kids were older and more in the ""logic"" stage instead of the impulsive toddler stage.

Changing own pull ups and hates the potty,"Up until March, my 2yo daughter  was at daycare and interested in peeing on the potty. It seemed she was motivated by being around other toddlers using the potty.

For the past 5 months, she mainly been at home with us. We tried using a sticker chart, with some limited success to get her to continue using the potty. She lost interest and we didn't pressure her. She tells us when she's peeing and pooping, but usually while/after it happened. 

About 4 weeks ago, her younger sister was born. 

A few days ago, we attempted 3 day potty training. We kept her pantsless except for outside time (we have mulch and a sandbox!) and it was miserable. She screamed and resisted at nearly every single potty suggestion. She was only willing to sit on the potty while holding an iPad, and we didn't find this sustainable. She pooped and peed on the floor more than in the potty and begged for a diaper repeatedly. She had tantrums all day long that turned quite aggressive. She (unintentionally) kicked me in my csection incision which is still healing. 

On the morning of day 3, we called it quits. She went back into pull-ups. Her attitude completely changed for the better. 

Since then, she's been changing her own pull-ups. Its cool when its just pee. But, she seems to poop after waking up from her nap and silently tries to change her diaper. It's resulted twice in her smearing poop around her room in her attempt to change herself.

We've removed the diapers and wipes from her room. We will be more closely monitoring the end of her nap time. 

What else can we do? How should we move forward with potty training?

“Ssss” is an important sound,"My two year old is getting more intelligible all the time, but he really struggles with the letter S.

I’ve especially enjoyed the following phrases with the Sss sound not quite there...

“I want to ride a hor[s]e!”
“I need to [s]it!”
“Give me a fox!”
“Look at my [s]ock!”

Speech tips?,"Right before covid my now 22 month old got referred to behavior health because she wasn’t talking yet. She’s great in every area except speech and always had been. But she never actually got to a speech therapist because we all got sent to our homes indefinitely. 

Right now she says Maaa (when she’s usually upset about something, not when she refers to me), Daaaa when dad gets home from work. And an “ello” for hello, usually when she’s looking for someone. Other than that she just babbles a lot, no words even close to comprehensible. 

And that’s all she was saying 5 months ago. I haven’t followed through with video conferences with a speech therapist. I know. I’m horrible. Part of me was hoping she would just outgrow it and start talking one day. And video calls are hard to do with a toddler. 

I’ve been doing sign language since about 8 months. Drink, thank you, please, diaper, mom, all the basic words. She won’t do any of them. She won’t mimic me at all. I spend all day narrating our lives, Pointing out colors, asking her questions, saying what it is that she wants when I figure it out. For example - when she coughs she’s thirsty.

What can I do at home now to help her? She gets frustrated so easily and I feel like it’s because she can’t express what she wants or how she’s feeling other than screaming like a banshee. 

I’ve got twin boys that are 9 - they did the sign language before a year old and were speaking complete sentences before they were two. This is new for me.",1,"Speech tips?

Suggestions Gor Dad to Help Mom,"Hello!

My baby girl is 2! He's super active and imaginative.

I work two jobs during the week and have a small period of time after work during the week to take the kids (really just my 2 year old as my 14 year old handles himself) off of wifey's hands. So, while I do my best during the week...the weekend is where I really try to capitalize on time and let my wife sleep all day, or eat crunch bars and watch teen romances all day like a school girl.

I have plenty of things my daughter and I do, but I want some variation. What are some active, energy expending things do you do with your kids.

Preferably...

- At no to little cost (for instance, I crawl around on all fours with her on my back like I'm a Horsey, we dance a lot, etc)

- Inside is better because of the Florida heat, but also outside would be better if it doesn't result in her needing three baths in a row or me to soak for a day in  an Epsom salt bath!

Dad thinks she is too young and will take longer to train. I’ve been reading the Oh Crap!

Halp meee,"How am I supposed to “childproof” my house for my terdler when he beats all of the childproof devices 😭 first it was the snap on door knob covers, pulled those apart and chewed on them. I put it back and he had it apart in .02 seconds flat. Then it was the baby gate he climbed right on up and almost toppled over, so I replaced that with a 4ft steel vertical bar one with a latch and latch lock on top... that he has figured out how to open if the latch isn’t locked, but my mother in law (whom we live with) has arthritis and can’t unlatch 🤦🏻‍♀️ Now it’s these cabinet/drawer latches he can open no issues. Oh and those plastic plugs for outlets? He tries to pull them out with his teeth. So I got the box covers for them... which he’s learned if he lays in front of and kicks at repeatedly they’ll pop off and exposed the outlet. Forgot to mention he ripped a hole in his playpen that’s I once used as “baby jail” and tore it just big enough to basically birth himself out and now it’s a game to crawl in and fuss then crawl out and laugh that he can go in and out 🤦🏻‍♀️ Please send help 😭😭😭",1,"Halp meee How am I supposed to “childproof” my house for my terdler when he beats all of the childproof devices 😭 first it was the snap on door knob covers, pulled those apart and chewed on them.

Random question about playing in undefined backyards...,"So we live in a townhouse and the whole neighborhood is just rows of townhouses on both sides of each road.

Toddler Upset by Baby Crying,"My older son will be 3 next month and my younger son is two months. Younger son’s crying can be very intense. He started reflux meds and ice cut dairy, which seems to be trending in the right direction, but he’s a baby, so there will still times when he just scream cries. If it happens in the same room with my older son for more than a minute, it upsets my older son to the point where he is hysterically crying and one of us has to sit with him and actively work on helping him calm down. This happened twice in the car driving home from picking the older one up from daycare and again last night at dinner when I had to give the baby medicine.

Has anyone else been through this that has suggestions on anything that was helpful? After the first daycare pick up, I talked through it all with the older one to try to prep him for what might happen in the car, but it didn’t make a difference. It’s to the point where we haven’t been out of the house as a family for over two months because younger son is so hit-or-miss on whether he’ll scream in the car or not. I don’t think it’s an attention thing because there are times when the baby cries and it doesn’t bother him or times when both of us are giving attention to the baby and he doesn’t act up, it seems more like either hearing it close or seeing it (or the combination of the two) is really distressing to him.

Almost 18 month old anxious around family members,"I'm not really sure what to do about this situation, other than give it time, so if that's what I'm recommended to do, I will, but I thought I'd see if anyone else had any advice. This is going to be unnecessarily long, because I need to work out my thoughts, so buckle in or bail!

My older son will be 18 months later this month, and he's having a hard time warming up to some family members. I'm not sure if quarantine has anything to do with it, or if personalities are the culprit, maybe a mix, but his anxiety gives Me anxiety, and I just want him to be happy and comfortable.  

Specifically, he is anxious around my in-laws. My mother-in-law in particular, but also my brother-in-law. They have really strong, loud personalities and voices, but we're not a really noisy family at home. We talk, but at like a normal volume, not the volume you'd use of you were talking to someone all the way across a busy sports stadium. As a result, he is more than shy around them. He flat out does not warm up, won't let them hold him without screaming, won't make eye contact, won't let them play with him. Even over many consecutive days.

I don't make him do anything like hug them or even acknowledge their presence, because I remember how much I disliked certain family members after being forced to be affectionate with them as a child. It actually makes me kind of sad because now I've gotten close with one of those family members and I wish we'd always had a closer relationship. That being said, my mother-in-law takes it really personally. After a couple of days of being rejected she gets a bit pouty and I can tell she is really hurt. She doesn't Say anything directly and keeps trying with him, but he's just not having any of it. She is his only grandma so I really want him to have a good relationship with her, and she's such an amazing mom to my husband and his brothers. He's also her first (biological) grandchild so she was so excited for his arrival, and I can tell that her expectations are really letting her down. She was diagnosed with cancer right before we conceived, and is now doing well but I know she worried she may never meet him, and so is all the more invested in it. Man I just feel so bad for her in this regard.

However, I rely on this fantastic woman for support because I have a younger baby as well, and it's becoming difficult to accept help because it is starting to make more work for me calming him down and then still dealing with his needs, on top of dealing with the little baby. I really need the help, but the help is unwanted by my son!

In the before times, he was so chill with them, and spent overnights without us there. I know he's gone through some other developmental changes that may have increased his separation anxiety regardless of covid, but I do worry about the impact our isolation has on him.

My brother-in-law I'm not as worried about because he's just a bit of a bonehead and tries to pick the babies up as soon as he walks through the door, Android 6 I get that a big hairy stranger appearing and plucking you out of your Mama's arms is scary, so we avoid it as much as possible now, but I worry the damage has been done from before I acquired a spine. But we don't see him too often do it's not as big of a deal, but he does love my kids, and my son loves His kids, so I'd like the relationship to improve.

He is not like this with everyone though! For example, my family he's totally cool with. They are significantly quieter, and give him lots of space to come to them, so I'm sure that helps. My dad is one of his best buds, and he lights up when he visits his Grandpa. My sisters are great with him and he adores them, will let them play with him for hours and change him, and I'm really grateful for their presence in my sons' lives. He's also okay with my father-in-law, who is a pretty quiet dude, especially contrasted against his wife, which I think contributes to her totally understandable feelings.

It's hard being his person all of the time when his dad (his Real favourite person) is at work. I want to help him feel safe and comfortable with all these wonderful people who love him and treat him like gold. I want all family members to feel connected to him and not feel rejected constantly. What can I do!!??

Also should note that they are really good people. I don't think that they have ever or would ever do anything to hurt him. I think it's just typical toddler business, I just want to move through it faster. Maybe I should just appreciate it more since it won't last forever, but man it's hard to decline help with the newborn.",1,"Almost month old anxious around family members I'm not really sure what to do about this situation, other than give it time, so if that's what I'm recommended to do, I will, but I thought I'd see if anyone else had any advice.

The cost of raising a child who likes to work on stuff,"I have a teenage son who likes to work on motorcycles and vehicles. This is generally great because I work on machines too and many times we work together. I got him a set of tools that rivals my own... yet he still borrows mine frequently and well, how to put this gently... he loses or misplaces my tools all the time, so when I go to work on something, I waste so much time looking for them. It seems no amount of reminding him to put them back where they belong. Of course I’ve thought about locking them up, but I’d so much rather be able to simply trust him. I’ve come to the realization that maybe lost tools are just part of the cost of having an otherwise fantastic son. I figure once he moves out of the house I’ll replace what I need and be glad for the times we got to fix stuff together.

Well. Help.,"I am out of my depth. Both, BOTH, of my boys have come to me saying they are not heterosexual beings.

Ok.

Their dad and i had talks about this way before either was born and the result was essentially, ""doesn't matter; love kids."" 

Son one came to me as bi. He wanted to express it in some way. I bought him nail polish and remover and cotton balls (this was not just me trying to assume, he specifically asked). He just came to my room basically asking for fashion advice i am in no way qualified to give. I wear jeans and a shirt that will cover my belly 99% of the time.

Son two, on the way home from the dentist this week, said he's transgender. He shoved into my hand, while i was driving, some referrals to LGBTQ specializing therapists.

I'm so lost. I, of course, love them completely. I have no interest in anything that might ""explain"" or ""apologize for"" who they are. They are my kids. They are wonderful, kind, compassionate people. There is nothing to explain. The end. 

They are, no doubt, better than me.

But i am no fashionista that can help the one child find his soul. I am no trans advocate that can help the other find HIS soul.

I'm a pretty normal, straight, cis-gendered 40+ year old that does not know what to say or do or the best steps to take for either child. I'm alone. My family will not accept. Their dad's family is questionable.

I feel inadequate. Scared. Protective. Lost.
Alone.

Why do i feel like i failed something in some way? Their dad... He's gone now. Would be *really* have been ok? What the hell is wrong with me to even ask that?

48 hours ago,my wife's cousin have come to my IL's house,his clothes completely ripped,looks like he escaped from a zombie apocalypse and he was generally in bruises.We immediately brought him to the hospital we worked and at there we learned the all story.

He is gay and he is in a traditional Catholic family.My extended IL family is generally really abusive and they beat him out when they discovered porn material in his phone and he ran out,only with his phone and his ID card,in his pyjamas .He found a car to bring him to the city(they live in a rural village that is 3 hours away from where we live) and came to my IL's house. We immediately filed claims about them and with the letters they are sending to me and my wife(a long story),it is not going to last long but he is physically safe for now and also his dad and older brothers are currently arrested (they even did not deny what they did and his mom brought all his stuff to my ILs home really quick after saying that he is a pédale and his other brothers are real men.(which is kinda syn with saying f*g but worse)

I am going through a hard time(some shit in my family either) but if my wife's parents can not adopt him(which is a possibility because they are old),we will and both of us do not have any idea other than he needs mental health care heavily so we hooked him up with a therapist and also to an adolescent clinic.Other than,we do not have an idea at all (we were both child free but this is going to change as we see).

"[Son, 14, Dating] My son asked me a question which I don't know how to really answer.","This is probably going to sound like the plot cheesy movie or something along those lines. But I wouldn't be here if I didn't need advice and if I weren't serious.

So, for context and a bit of background, normally I wouldn't post about this sort of thing on reddit, since I'm not a avid internet user (I am a doctor in a small rural town, probably the only General Practitioner). This account belongs to my younger half brother who is 22 and I'm 50. (Long stor). We live together and I occasionally share the account just so I can browse on reddit. (Or lurk as the kids call it.)  So just to clarify for those of you who like to peak into account histories and what have you. 

Anyways onto the main event: My son, who for privacy we'll call Ryan, is 14, he has Aspergers or HFA. But he's a good kid, very sociable, and friendly. But yesterday evening when we were having dinner he came to me and said his best friend who is a girl who we'll just call Courtney for her own privacy, decided to share her true feelings about him and essentially gave him his first kiss according to him. Now my son, he doesn't mind the things that come with HFA, like a dislike of loud noises or being touched (He plays football at his High School for God's sakes) he said Courtney asked him if he would go out with her. He didn't quite know how to respond given the situation and the fact he's never dated before

I myself have Aspergers, so I can kind of understand why he'd feel confused about this whole situation, I was diagnosed when  I was in my mid 40s, but I could understand where he was coming from so I could help him, but this? I can't really explain. I also have another son whose 11. My other son attests that he was there when it went down and Courtney asked Ryan if he'd go out with her. Ryan said that he'd think on it. Now I don't know what else happened after that, I only know this was when they were leaving the park nearby when my brother took them hiking in the nearby mountains yesterday. (We live in the Pacific Northwest, USA)

He and Courtney have known each other since they were both around five, and like I mentioned, have been best friends since then. Now Ryan's mother (My wife) passed away back in 2012 due to bone cancer and he hasn't quite been the same since, he actually was very affected by it, but that's a story I'd rather not get too much into. To put it simply, he asked me what he should do, he talked about the fact that apparently he's had such feelings towards her as well but he never actually considered her in that capacity.  But today and later that evening he seemed to actually be happier but confused.

So to put it bluntly, what advice should I give him? How should I explain it? We already had the ""talk"" too, but this took me by surprise since I thought they were just simply friends.

Lying about whereabouts!,"My teen 16f just got her license last weekend and she has already lied about where she was going. I had filled her tank in the beginning of the week on Monday and I went out to use it for some errands and the tank was almost empty. The car has really good gas mileage and wouldn’t run out that fast.  The only times she has been out so far is to work which is 5mi down which is like a 10min drive. 

I have confronted her about it and she got all panicked and said she didn’t know and just said  went to work all those times. I’m worried she went way further than she let’s on. I don’t want to be that parent to put a tracking device on her phone or possibly even her car but she’s not telling the full truth. I took away the keys and said I would drive her to work until she ether tells me the truth or I can trust her again.",0,Lying about whereabouts!

"""Atheist's don't have morals""","This is what a 9th grader said during a debate today at my daughter's school in front of a hundred kids while discussing the ethics of cloning. 

This really shocked my daughter as we are a science based family that are atheists and also have a strong ethical and moral foundation as citizens in society and members of our community. Furthermore since we do not believe in an afterlife we view life as sacred, fragile, and that we as humans are the caretakers of the earth. 

Humans are social creatures, they have empathy and compassion by nature. Babies will try to help other babies, even rats have empathy and will work to free a distressed rat from a cage. It is extremely basic behavior to show kindness, not something you learn in a book.

18 y/o male cannot grow up?,"So my 18 y/o brother has always lived a very sheltered life (with the exception of living through my parents horrible relationship etc. so he’s a little scarred). My sister and I are sort of like mom figures to him, and he’s been living with us for a bit since he can’t go back to school due to COVID. My mom basically treats him like a little child and does everything for him (cook, clean, washes his clothes, etc etc). My brother doesn’t have any friends growing up, and still doesn’t today. He spends a lot of time alone because he says “people are the sources of all trouble.” AND AT 18 y/o, he still has COOTIES!!! He can’t watch scenes of people kissing because he thinks it’s gross, shows no interest in dating guy/girl/person. He also takes HOURS (and I mean HOURS) doing anything. If an average high school senior takes 10 hours total to write a good essay, it will take him 30 hours. If an average person takes 5 minutes making PB&amp;J, it will take him at least 20min. (You get the idea).

He doesn’t really know how to express himself. You take him to the doctor and he has trouble explaining his symptoms. He’s definitely a little socially awkward, and he he shuts down and doesn’t talk to you when he’s upset about something.

Ever since the pandemic started, he just likes to sit in his room. He doesn’t like to talk about his future, college, and has no motivation to think about what he wants to do in the future. He seems to just want to be a little kid forever, with someone there to take care of him.

We just really don’t know what to do about him and help him along to adulthood and getting him to start making decisions for himself. Any advice on how to speed up the growing up process? Or is it too late if he needs help?",0,"y/o male cannot grow up?

Don't minimize the level of stress your kids might have,"We as adults have our problems, what we strongly believe are stronger reasons of stress, so we tend to minimize our kids worries, fears.

My oldest one likes to be heard when she ask for attention (but she could ignore you when you wants her attention).

Well, if you followed my previews post, last night was good but today she is stressed, her mind is in ""her problems"" which is fine.

2020 has finally kicked my ass,"TW: suicidal ideation

I got a call from my 14yo daughter’s school wellness counselor yesterday while I was at work. She is suicidal, and I had no idea. She had asked to start seeing a therapist again because she was having anxiety and we’d been working on getting the appointments, but there were a lot of delays and her first solo appointment was just rescheduled to a later date that morning. She was meeting with the school counselor and an intern in the meantime. The head counselor called me while her meeting with the intern was happening, and they kept my daughter on the Zoom call to make sure she was safe until I could get to her. I dropped what I was doing and we went straight to the emergency room. They put her on a 5150 hold. Both the counselor and the psychiatrist she saw at the ER said it seemed primarily due to emotional abuse at the hands of her father. I know what he’s like, but the judge wasn’t convinced at our hearing and he still gets to see her most weekends and holidays and has equal legal custody. I’m so, so grateful that she had someone to talk to so we could get her help, because I DIDN’T SEE IT. Even after I knew, I came home to get her to take her to the hospital and she seemed like her normal self. We were in the ER for almost 12 hours waiting for a transport to a pediatric facility and she seemed like her normal self. She has been feeling this way for over a year, and she has seemed like her normal self. I am terrified. 

Now I have so much to do and I feel like I just ran out of the mental and emotional capacity to do it. I don’t even know where to start.

Daughter dating an older man,"Hello everyone, 

I guess I’m asking for advice.  

Me and my daughter have always had a very close bond but lately it’s been rocky because of who she is seeing. My daughter is 16 and dating a 21 year old man. Just typing that grosses me out. 

About a month ago, she came to me to explain she was seeing him. She met him at a local job fair (that I now regret taking her to). 

Really the only thing that bothers me is his age. He has a job, goes to college, seems pretty nice but it gives me the creeps that he’s attracted to my child. I refuse to leave them alone in a room cause I’m worried he really only wants her for one thing. 

All we do is argue all day and night about this guy. I want to trust that she’s not going to just throw herself to this guy but it’s so damn hard. I wanna file a restraining order but that would ruin our relationship.

Having a tough time accepting that my 14yo daughter is growing up. Stressing.,"First time poster. I’ve made a few comments here and there.

Like the title states, I’m having a tough time accepting that my daughter is growing up. Like, anxiety that keeps me up at night.

I worry about everything from boys to school, to making sure social media and things alike don’t cause mental strain.

I wonder if she might be growing up too fast? I compare things to what I was doing at her age (and I’m not old)

My ultimate goal has always been to make sure she is happy and equipped with the knowledge to make safe and healthy decisions.

But I still stress. Am I teaching her the right things? Will she actually take my advice? Does she think I’m overbearing? Will she be easily influenced? Will she come to me with important things?

She tells me things and I trust her but I STILL STRESS! I’m outspoken so I’m always gonna say what’s on my mind or what I think about things and I also worry I might scare her off?

Parenting is tough and scary. And I only make it harder because my brain doesn’t stop.

Abortion and Teenagers,"My 17f goes to a  Private Catholic school in the city. We are Catholics, however, we don’t strictly follow their teachings.

16-year-old identity crisis,"My family and I have moved to many different countries, it was very hard but now being older I appreciate it a lot. My younger brother had a harder time, after living in an expat community going to a British school, he always mentioned how much he hated life there and how he wanted to go back to the US (we lived in the US when he was from ages 1-5), I couldn't understand his fascination wanting to live in a country he couldn't remember. He even had an American accent while attending a British school.

Anyway, my parents decided for the sake of his education, and because we were US citizens for us to finally move back and for my brother to finish high-school in the US to go to college, he was so excited and ready for his new life. Within a couple of weeks, he already hated it. Started saying things with a British accent, wouldn't stop talking about his old friends and decided he wanted to go to college in the UK. My parents were/are FURIOUS. Fast forward to today, he has an unflinching British accent and a holier-than-thou attitude where he thinks life will be better for him in the UK. My brother is 100% one of those people that always thinks the grass is greener on the other side.

My parents desperately want him to stay in the US for college to be close to family but also they don't understand where this negative attitude came from, especially during a pandemic, he doesn't really understand what life can be like in the US. Every night ends up in a screaming match with my mom's argument is we moved here for you/you can't just move countries when you want/you need to adapt/our family is here now etc.  He is 100% determined to go to school in the UK which breaks my parents heart as they have sacrificed a lot to bring us to the US...

The first week I wasn't bothered strange new surroundings thinking she settle down But her anxiety has remained pretty high.

I've tried to talk about therapy with her the result was her saying  she would sleep alone but she didn't sleep for over 36  hours end up having an emotional meltdown waking me.

Advice about my brother(14),"I am in a bit of a predicament here regarding my younger sibling.

He has been going through some rough times in his life right now especially when it comes to dealing with my parents. My parents have expressed to me the same about him. I just moved out about 6 months ago in a fit of rage with my parent when they decided to take away my personal property as a punishment for my siblings. These items were various game systems and my personal computer that I all payed for with my own money. My parents are firm believers that using these technologies for anything aside from education is detrimental to our well being and mental state. 

Ever since I moved out from my parents house my parents have gotten rid of everything that my younger sibling finds entertaining because they felt after that I moved out, it caused my brother to lose respect for them. This is most likely true considering how he has been acting since. He knows full and well his responsibilities around the house and pertaining to school, however, whenever my parents ask him to do something, it is usually followed with a threat of taking something away which in turn causes him to specifically rebel and do the exact opposite of what he has been told.

The only person that can get him to hold him self accountable for his actions is me, and I can tell my parents despise that I still have his respect and they don't. This in turn causes them to punish him more for being disrespectful, and there have been a few times where it has gotten to the point where my mom will physically move him down to his room and ensure that he does not come out until he has learned his lesson. My younger brother has just learned to accept this and will no longer do anything willingly for my parents and my parents just push back in the same way and the situation isn't improving for either one of them. 

I have heard my Dad wants to give him up to foster care and that if this continues with no improvement he will carry out this. He does the things my parents expect when I ask him to do them because he knows I am sympathetic with his situation and understands his responsibility to keep his grades up and such because I had trouble with it when I was younger too. But I cannot be there all the time to hold him accountable and I want to teach him to be that way as well, but whenever my parents intervene, usually with some form of punishment, he ends up right back where he started.

I want the situation to improve for the both of them so they don't have to go through such a rough patch moving out like I did.

How do you make sure your child still has social outlets during quarantine?,"With the first lockdown my son got really aggressive and depressed(struggling with school work and by in large in poor mental health). I tried my best with letting have his own space and time to him self in a quite area.

He was never a really social kid he talks about friends a lot but rarely pre pandemic ever had anyone at the house or asked me to drop him off places but it’s getting significantly worse. I try my best to respect his boundaries and be laissez faire and not be a helicopter parent but he’s starting to fail classes(use to be a straight A student). I know I’ve been very strict about quarantine we haven’t really left the house at all most of the food from gardening, dried/canned, and primarily Amazon fresh(sanitizing the bags and putting it in an isolation fridge for a bit). I try to go to nature reserves and places without people but a lot of places are crowd. I’ve been extreme cautious not just for me and my husbands health but long term effects on covid plus my daughter has asthma. He’s been doing nothing but play video games and almost always addresses other family members with an extremely aggressive tone. When pressed at dinner he typically barks. I tried online counseling but he’s been extremely uncooperative. The more the pandemic continues the more I feel like he’s getting physiologically damaged.

Just worried.,"I worry about my 14 year old. He’s choosing to distance himself from his peers. We live in a smallish town with a view to returning to the city we are from in the future. He can see that he is not like the other kids, his world view and life experiences are really different. At the same time, he makes comments about not seeing anyone socially or online, but then complains about the people he does play with online who are a bit ragey. 

I think he’s half expecting to move back to the city sooner (He has probably overheard conversations between his dad and me) and probably wants to be ready to go. I feel really sick and anxious when he talks about not seeing people outside of school. I’m encouraging him to get a job so he has something to do that’s with people. He seems to want to but is also a bit nervous about actually applying. I really don’t want to project my issues on him. I remember high school as having phases of socialising and phases of lulls.

Found some concerning stuff in my daughter’s journal,"I was going to surprise my daughter (17) today with new furniture in her room and some new decor while she was at work. I figured I’d find some silly love note or something along those lines. What I found was much more of a shock for me. As I was cleaning her closet I saw a box overflowing with condoms, sex toys, and used pregnancy test that were all negative with dates on them. My husband who was with me panicked and tore apart her room. 

We found a notebook tucked away in her backpack with dated entries as far back from two years ago with different guys she was having sex with. These guys she wrote about were older men that were all 20+. They would pick her up from school and have sex in their cars/hotels and drop her back off at school all while I thought she was at a club or getting homework done. There was even a entry of her inviting a 36yo man into our home, tying her up, and having sex on her bed. Another included a 25yo man she was “dating” that was abusive and would take her to hotels and said he would choke her or slap her repeatedly. She constantly wrote that we didn’t care about her and that nobody would help which is entirely not true. 

I confronted her about it when she got home but she more outraged that we went Into her room without her permission and then reading her journal.

High school senior is considering deferring college. How to make the most of a gap year?,"My oldest is a high school senior and is applying to colleges. My wife teaches at a nearby university and she has friends who are freshmen in college this year. She has decided that if the pandemic is still a huge problem next fall then she is going to defer college for a semester or a year. She wants no part in college during a pandemic. This is assuming she gets into at least one of her top choices. I know a lot of kids who take gap years do a class or two at a local community college to get some credits but given that she would have submitted a deposit to enroll at another university, I don't think she would be allowed to enroll in a community college course for credit. If the pandemic is still an issue then she won't be able to travel much either, which is another thing people do during gap years. She just got a job (starts today!) and plans on continuing to work if she defers enrollment but is there anything else kids can do to make the most out of a gap year? She'll be 18 this upcoming week and is a very serious and motivated student so I am not worried about her slacking off but she likes having structure and a purpose so I know sitting around all day doing nothing would crush her. I'm not pressuring her. I'm only looking for ideas to give to her because she isn't sure a gap year would be worth it if she's doing nothing but also doesn't want to go to college during a pandemic.

"Dangers of snapchat, mspy is HORRIBLE (read inside), any suggestions on monitoring","Sorry for the three topics in one subject heading, but Im frustrated and needed a place to chat and vent.  

Like many households, my wife and I made the decision to allow our children to have smart phones.  Again like many households, it started innocently enough with our first child in middle school with lots of oversight, rules and monitoring.  However, as time moved on and the perception of responsibility and maturity took over, we paid less and less attention to our oldest as our younger 2 boys required more time.

Enter snapchat.  We really had no clue just how devious this app was.  I understood the basics behind it.  Chat, send pics and vids, and everything is deleted.   I wasnt super worried about the social aspects of this for my kid as he is smart, does good in school, has lots of extracurriculars, and all in all is pretty well rounded.  To be honest, I was no angel at 16 and I do realize that kids grow up...16 years old and this is how the teenagers communicate, whats the worse that can happen...Boobs and d1ck pics?    My wife and I have always tried to be open, honest, and informative when it comes to discussing sexual relationships but in the end it is up to them to make and be accountable for their decisions.  All that being said...there was 1 thing I overlooked....the DRUGS!!!  

I had no idea...and not to spoil the ending here...but I think we caught this in time.   Anyway....if you arent aware, here is how it works.....There are literally drug dealers on snapchat...and lots of them.  One small aspect of snap chat are snap maps.  it makes it real easy to see where any of your friends are.  you simply go to the map and it shows you were everyone is.  Another aspect is your snap chat story...its just like facebook or instagram feed where you just post stuff and everyone that you want to see it will see it.   

Taking these things into consideration, these guys/girls constantly update their stories with a mixture of cars, bling, cash, guns, girls and then all the drugs that they currently have with them and how much it all costs.  as a kid, all you have to do is snap a dealer ""soccer practice ends in 10 mins, this is where I am, my moms gonna be 20 mins late, Ill take zannies, lean, cookies and cream and some shatter"" its that easy and your kid just bought xanax, codeine, marijuana and another form of smokable THC.  They can get vape, dabs, pills, pot, guns, whatever anyone is selling.  Doesnt matter where you live, how nice it is or how many gates there are.  There are people in your community selling drugs and they can and will get to your kids on snapchat.  Any moment your child is not within your sites, they can be buying drugs...its that easy.  You can go 500 miles away on vacation and your child can link up with a drug dealer before the plane lands or you park the car.  Thats just the reality of whats going on

&amp;#x200B;

Im my kids case, on his phone he was following like 15 of these guys.  Did he buy and use...yup!  Did I catch him..yup!  Is he now drug tested minimum once a week...yup!  I digress a bit from this to bring up mspy

&amp;#x200B;

i tried mspy for like 2 hours and realized it ain't the answer.  there is nothing out there that can monitor snapchat...i mean nothing.   even rooting an iPhone and adding mspy doesn't work...or work well....and on a side note, mspy...once they get your money, good luck getting a refund, they will do anything other than give you your money back.  As I said, I bought it, tried it for less than 24 hours and then realized it wasn't the answer.

Im going to end this WOT with a request for any diligent parents to post their monitoring solutions.  Also, I appreciate all comments but if you're gonna tell me to not allow snapchat, dont bother...its the only way the kids are communicating unfortunately.  removing it puts them on a socially void island....believe me, I watched it for 2 months while he was grounded from his phone and its hard to witness them being cut out of their social group",0,"Dangers of snapchat, mspy is HORRIBLE (read inside), any suggestions on monitoring Sorry for the three topics in one subject heading, but Im frustrated and needed a place to chat and vent.

A stranger accosted my daughter in the street and accused her of bullying,"Hi!

My daughter is 13 years old, she is a shy and timid soul. The type that hides behind her long hair and actively avoids any situation she isn't comfortable with (we're working on that).

On Wednesday (7th Oct) she was walking back home after getting off the school bus and a woman drove up to her in her car and stopped my daughter and accused her of bullying a boy (also from my daughters school). My daughter denied this and eventually ignored the lady and walked away.

It transpires that a group of school children were throwing berries at each other. The group consisted of a friend of my daughters, the friends brother, brothers friend and another boy (lets call him 'J'). My daughter was not throwing berries as has been confirmed by my daughter and 3 of the other four pupils.

The woman who stopped my daughter witnessed the berry throwing and interpreted it as J being bullied. She has apparently pulled over to talk to J who has told this lady he was being bullied and that my daughter and my daughters friend were attempting to force him into eating the berries and were punching him. J is well known at the school for embellishing the truth and has been in trouble multiple times for punching other students.

I find it quite disturbing that this lady has then actively sought out a 13 year old child (from where she spoke to J to where she stopped my daughter is about 1/4 mile) to then berate her in the street. Furthermore she has then posted to a community Facebook group about the incident, giving details of what school my daughter goes to, what bus stop she gets off at and what year at school she is in (this is the UK btw). This post has over 100 comments from what can only be described as a Facebook mob (and of course plaudits for her). The comments consist of people calling for those involved to be exposed, to be expelled and encouraging people to phone the school to express their anger.

The later of the above has been happening and random people have been contacting the school demanding justice. 

My daughter is now scared to get the bus home for fear of these Facebook vigilantes. I am beyond angry about this - I have logged the incident with the Police as no adult should be stopping a CHILD in the street to intimidate them and to then further it by doing the Facebook post. The Police told me this is common and the people that post such things on Facebook don't actually care about any of what they're posting about, they're just looking for attention for themselves. 

I also feel that this woman is now in fact the bully, by intimidating my daughter and causing potential issues at the school.

I had written a long message to her calling her out on what she's done, but then I thought better of it as she'll likely ignore anything I say and just use it to make another Facebook post.

The woman in question did ring the school to report what J told her, which is fine, and is all the action she needed to have taken. But she has overstepped the mark with her additional actions, of which the Police agree with me on. The Police have said they will be speaking to her about stopping children in the street, I have also reported her post to Facebook, not that I expect them to do anything about it.

Apart from that there isn't any other recourse, I'm so very angry, if this gets around school and my daughters name comes up it may well cause issues at the school for her with other pupils (of course not something this woman would have stopped to think about).

Has anyone else had a similar experience?",0,"A stranger accosted my daughter in the street and accused her of bullying Hi!  My daughter is years old, she is a shy and timid soul.

How can I stop my teen from buying things?,"She [17] got a job just last year and even set up a bank account that deposit money into her account and she can purchase stuff with a debit card. 

I don't mind if she indulges a little bit in things she enjoys but it infuriates me when I see a package at the front door with her name on it from clothing places or a makeup product. I have ripped her debit card right out her hands and told her she could get it back when she stops buying stuff. That didn't stop her though and she apparently had a photo copy of the card in which she entered her details into apple pay and still buy things. Its ether that or she'll send her packages to her friends house instead. I have tried to talk about the importance of money but she just doesn't care. There is still a fair amount in her account (1K) and her weekly paychecks add onto it but don't want her to think she can just go around and spend foolishly. If she wants to order  something she has to ask permission first before buying.",0,How can I stop my teen from buying things?

16-year-old stepdaughter’s first job - driving to and from,"My (32F) spouse, Nick (41M), have been dating 5 years. He has two children from a previous marriage, let’s say, Alice (16F) and Larry (11M).  For the most part the relationships are all amicable, including between myself and his ex wife, Sara (42F). I am now pregnant with my first. The kids live with their mother most of the time but spend a night or two with us every weekend.  Nick drives them to sports, outings, etc whenever he can but he works 12-830pm M-F. 

Alice began applying for her first real job. She was applying at a mall that is a fair distance away, and so while she was applying I was asking my spouse, how will she get to/ from work ? In my opinion, a major part of having a job, for a young person, is to develop independence and life skills. This was never really addressed/ discussed further.  So now she has landed a retail job at that mall and I again asked, how will she get there and home ? The first thing I did was check out the bus routes and she can bus, will take about 45 mins and 2 busses, but I don’t think this is a very good solution when she’s leaving at 9-10pm at night. Our city isn’t the safest city (although that area is pretty safe). 

A couple days ago I get a text message from Alice asking me to take her to work on Thursday (today).  I was frustrated because 1) like I said, I think that a job is not just about the financial independence but also to develop independence and life skills and 2) I don’t want to be driving her every Thursday to work, I work full time myself, am 6 months pregnant, we’re moving next week and so I’m managing finding a subletter for our apartment and packing, I’m taking an Accounting course and I walk dogs in my spare time, I just don’t have it in me to add another thing on, especially when I don’t agree with the principal of it. 

Nick (and I presume Sara) and I disagree about this as Nick says he was driven around a lot by his parents, I responded that ‘you don’t know how to take a bus..’ I thought the point of parenting a teenager is to teach them to become independent adults who can manage on their own.  My parents didn’t drive me around every where, I walked to my first job until I could drive myself. I moved out when I was 18 and again I walked/ drove to work. 

To be clear, I’m not against EVER driving her to work, if it’s convenient, if the parents have nothing going on, sure.  But I don’t think it should be relied upon. I don’t think she should have even applied to jobs she can’t get to on her own, say, with more than 1 bus required, or within walking distance. We live in a city and so there are a lot of options in the area.

Teenager in trouble for bullying,"My son is currently in trouble for bullying another child. The child that was being bullied is from a very poor family. I am trying to figure out a way to go about this that opens my child's eyes to the real world outside of privilege.


I am a veterinarian, my children ( triplets M14) and I escaped from extreme abuse a while back and we are all in therapy. My children know how bad abuse can get. However my children have never been hungry. They have never had to do without or worry about if the bills would be paid. They have always had nice clothing and never had to deal with hand me downs. They have never struggled. 


I grew up as the youngest of 13 children born to Mexican Immigrants. We were very poor. I lost both of my parents before I turned 13 and afterward had to leave everything we had and lived on a street that was smack in the middle of two rival gangs. There was a bullet hole in my bedroom wall I could see out of. We had to choose between food and power quite often. I fought my way to the top of my field and was damned and determined my children would never hurt for anything but now I am worried that I may have done something wrong in that regard. 


My son knows very well that I fought my way to our current life so it angers me that he would treat someone who is currently living a life I lived for a very long time as less than human. I do not know if this is something that is stemming from all of the crap his father did that we are currently in therapy for or if he is just being an ass because he has more expensive things. My fiance thinks it has more to do with him being a teenager and just finding something to pick on someone for ( they adore my fiance so we know he isn't  acting out over me getting remarried).

One of the teachers called me out of concern and said she didn’t know my son, but he seems to be struggling in her class.  How weird is it that we live in a time where a teacher doesn’t know her high school student?  I am beyond frustrated.  The kids are doing band class and exercise class in their rooms.  Is anyone else just super worried about their kids development right now?",53,8,851,154,Teenager 13-19 Years

Secret social media accounts,"I told my daughter once she reached the age of 16 she was allowed to have social media. As long as I had the passwords to her accounts and I would have to follow her too. I didn't want her exposed to all the junk that's out there and anything that she post/says I am responsible for since she's a minor and the blame gets put on me. There are too many kids these days posting racist and hurtful things to eachother. 

Her big day was a few months ago and she didn't mention anything about it so I figured she wasn't interested in having any social media. Until one day, one of the mothers on Facebook that I am friends with mentioned that her daughter followed my daughter on social media. At first I was confused, because I made it clear that If I found any accounts she would loose the privilege of her phone. 

As soon as I got home, I went straight to her room to confront her. She realized there was no point in denying it now, since I had the usernames of all of her accounts on my phone. I looked through her Instagram and Snapchat and nothing struck out as bad or concerning. There were a few pictures of her drawings and some with her friends. 

Even her messages with friends/boys were mostly normal for the most part. I dont know what to do now.

How do I get my 17yo to just brush her teeth!,"This has been an onging problem since her early years of childhood. We adopted her when she was 4  from a poor country where living conditions were awful and I doubt there were any toothbrushes. I thought after I properly taught her proper hygiene the phase would end and she would learn that nobody likes bad breath and her oral hygiene would fail because she barely brushes at all. 

The most I've seen her do is  one time during the morning and thats it. And she barely brushes them but really just glides the toothbrush over a few teeth for a good 20-30sec. 

Every single time I bring her to the dentist, I have the same discussion with the dental hygienist that she needs to brush more. It makes me look like an embarrassment and that I don't care about my daughter at all. I even had to threaten to take her phone away or her computer but that doesn't stop her from not brushing.

"I just discovered my son wants to join a gang, how do I deal with this?","For some context, I figured this out due to me and my son sharing my laptop, due to him not having his own laptop. He is 14 years old, and he uses a site called Discord to chat with people. He left his Discord chats open, and I saw him talking to a gang member, which they call, ""a crew"". At first I wasn't sure what they were talking about, but it quickly dawned on me they were talking about joining a gang.   


I still have the discord chats, so they went like this, ""Hey, you wanna join my crew right?

The gang leader replied, ""Alright I'm gonna head to work now, let's see if you're good enough for this crew""

13 year old caught stealing over $1k on gaming,"My 13 year old brother has been stealing money and lying to our family since he was 11 and my (29F) are struggling to figure out what to do. 

I’d like some parenting suggestions as we’d like to go about this in the most healthy way as possible, but we’re all pretty shaken up about this. My little brother 2 years ago when he was 11 stole $200 in cash from my older brother to buy skins for fortnite. He got in trouble and things passed.   

Recently my boyfriend left his xbox at my parents and let him borrow it, my boyfriend found fraud on his bank for a purchase.  He let my little brother know he is not allowed to purchase anything and to not do it again.  This past week he gets another notification for a $200 charge going through on the Xbox. 

That same day our dad found another $100 purchase for a game.  Safe to say he’s grounded and has no access to any games anymore.  THEN, we find out he charged $300 to a credit card that we cannot find right now, someone else’s credit card that is no ones in our family.

THIS MORNING, we find out he found his tablet and bought $400 worth of games..... after he’s already in trouble for lying and stealing the money mentioned above. 

$1k+ in purchasing for gaming and lying about it still. 

He has fessed up to some of these and is making up lies and saying he doesn’t know where the other purchases came from even though it literally says his name as the purchase.

My teen son is abusive and I'm tired of parenting him,"My son is 17 years and 4 months old. I've been parenting as a divorced mom for 12 years. From age 5-9, my ex husband was involved in his parenting, less and less as time went on. And one day when my son was 9, he just didn't show up to get my son on his weekend--complete abandonment with no warning or explanation. He later voluntarily terminated his parental rights so he wouldn't have to pay the $18k in back child support he owed. So it's just been me and my son for the past 8+ years--no alimony, no child support.

When my son was young, he was a model child--sweet &amp; kind, smart, funny, social, great grades, etc. No parent could have asked for a better child. We were very close and loving with each other.  But since my son turned 12, it's been a different story. I know some of this is just typical teen stuff for sure, but some of it isn't and it can be extreme at times.

My ex husband is a psychopath. Very briefly, he and his new GF (who I caught him cheating with) made my life a living hell for YEARS. He dragged me back to court over and over for no reason--just to screw with me, my state of mind, my finances, and my professional reputation. I didn't do anything to bring this on and tried to be as amicable as possible, but it was a game to him. He was making $130k at the time we split and I had just restarted my career after 5 years as a SAHM, so our finances were in no way equal. He devastated me financially and emotionally because I had to hire a lawyer to defend myself and keep my custody rights. He lost every single court battle and kept switching attorneys, leaving a trail of debt behind him.  In the end, I prevailed but it cost me $20k that I didn't have in order to do so.

Just a small list of what my ex husband did to me: slashed my tires in a church parking lot while my son and I were in a cubscout meeting, threw a gallon of blood red paint on my garage door, brought multiple frivolous legal actions (I ""lived"" at the court house), stalked me in a rental car, sent me over 3000 abusive text messages (at a time when phones couldn't block callers), came to my house with a handgun and wouldn't leave until he was arrested, kidnapped my son from grade school on a day that wasn't his without notifying me (he was arrested for that), then in retaliation he had me arrested on false charges of communicating threats to his GF, libeled me to my colleagues about it, and left copies of ""The Blotter"" rag containing my mugshot in all my neighbors' paper boxes, etc etc etc. Imagine the WORST divorce you can and multiply it by 10 and that's what it was.

I hid nearly all of this from my son to the very best of my ability. He may have known there were a few strange things going on, but he didn't know it that his father was doing it. And I've never told him, or badmouthed his father in any way, because my lawyer told me to take the high road and it was the right thing to do. My son and I just don't talk about his father or even mention him except in passing very occasionally.

My son is extremely intelligent--IQ over 140, has always tested well and straight A grades come easily to him. He thinks he's smarter than everyone (including me) and he probably is, but he lacks wisdom (as all teens do). He started smoking weed when he was 14 and not too long after, psychedelics. He's honest with me about those things and I haven't come down too hard on him about it because I knew he'd just do it behind my back if I forbid it and the cat was already out of the bag and wasn't going back in. To my knowledge, he's never done any other drugs. And he's maintained his grades (all honors and AP classes--ranks near top of his class).  He's also popular--lots of friends (but it seems like most of them are losers) and he's had his share of GFs too.

Our house has always been the designated sleepover house. On any given weekend, there are 3-6 teen boys here. I've always been kind and friendly to his friends. We live in the same house we've lived in since my son was 4 years old, even though it's been very hard financially at times for me to keep up with it, and that's especially true since covid. The bills always get paid, he always has healthy home-cooked meals, he always has clean clothes to wear, I've always been involved with his school and gone to his school functions, etc. In other words, I'm a great mom.

But here's the problem. My son is an asshole. I feel used. I feel like nothing but a free vending machine to him. He's rude and contemptuous for no reason. I'm not a lazy or stupid or mean person--I'm kind and loving, smart, and hardworking. He has absolutely no appreciation for me or the things I do for him. I don't coddle him--he has chores and a job, and pays for his own gas money etc. But he did destroy my car by not putting any oil in it and I had to buy another (used) one--he paid me for about half of it but then he got in a fender bender and the car needed repairs so now he's back to owning none of it because I had to pay for that since he didn't have the money.  I have another old car that I drive.

I will admit that I have a tendency to forgive quickly and want things to go back to normal.  I sometimes allow him to get out of grounding early in exchange for extra chores.  I don't like being a hardass mom, and compared to some other parents I am a hardass, but I feel that maybe I'm a bit too soft at times.  My natural state is to be kind and loving, and it's very difficult for me to maintain being hard for very long.

I feel that some of this is my fault in that I had a live-in BF for awhile who was mildly emotionally abusive--moody and just mean at times.  He did not act as a stepfather to my son--they had very few interactions and just ignored/tolerated each other.  My son may have picked up some of his qualities.

One of my son's best friends (who I had treated like my own son) was extremely rude and disrespectful to me after I had taken him on a trip and paid for it (and it wasn't the first time). My son took his friend's side, and even after I banned this friend from our house (I didn't ban their friendship), he invited him back 3 months later and when I found him here I made him leave (big scene with the friend calling me a ""fucking bitch"" etc).  I suspect the boys had been drinking.  My son has also admitted that he's had alcohol multiple times (just like most teens I guess). This just happened 2 days ago.  My son doesn't understand why I was so upset that he invited his banned friend back.  He gaslighted me--""it was not big deal"" (it was), ""I thought it was water under the bridge"" and ""You're overreacting.""  This is typical for my son--if I'm ever upset for (very legitimate) reasons he always tries to downplay it and make me feel that I'm in the wrong. 

Once when we got into a huge argument, he pinned my hands above my head against the wall and screamed in my face for 5 minutes.  I couldn't move, I told him to let me go and he wouldn't.  I was afraid he might kill me.  He later apologized and swore he'd never do it again (and he hasn't) but I feel he only did that so I wouldn't have him arrested or send him to military school etc.  That's how I always feel--that he's just manipulating me to get whatever he wants and that he has no real love for me.

I tried to get him into counseling after this incident, but once the counselor found out that I knew my son smoked weed, her supervisor told her that she had to end the relationship because I was essentially condoning illegal behavior, and that was a legal risk for them.  I'm not condoning it, but I know I can't stop it so I don't try.  The counselor told me off the record that she understood my perspective and wished she could treat my son, but it was a legal issue so she couldn't.  I have not pursued any other counselor because the legal issues would be the same if we told the truth, and what's the point of counseling if you can't be honest?

I don't THINK my son is a psychopath like his father, but I wonder.  He never seems to have any empathy or understanding for my perspective.  He just uses me to get whatever he wants, and beyond that he doesn't seem to care about me at all.  He hasn't bought me birthday or mother's day or xmas gifts in several years, despite having the money, or if he has it's because I asked him to and told him exactly what I wanted--it wasn't done spontaneously out of love.  Some of this is definitely exacerbated by covid because school is virtual right now--I let him sleep in as late as he can, but when I bring him tea in bed every morning, he usually yells at me for waking him up.

Honestly I'm exhausted from parenting this child.  He just does whatever he feels like doing whenever he feels like doing it, and expects me to provide everything for him with nothing in return.  Yes, I understand that in many ways this is a typical parent/child relationship.  But is it RIGHT?  I'm a human being, not a free vending machine.  If this was ANY other type of relationship, it would absolutely be labeled abusive.  It's very hard for me to live with someone who is so negative towards me for no reason.  I'm constantly on eggshells and my physical and mental/emotional health are taking a toll.  He TAKES everything and gives NOTHING.  It's completely one-sided.  I just want to sell my house and move away.  I'm very tired of being used and abused.  He has 8 months of high school left, and then hopefully he will be in college on a ""full ride"" scholarship, but I'm not sure how much more of this I can take, or SHOULD take.",0,"My teen son is abusive and I'm tired of parenting him My son is years and months old. I've been parenting as a divorced mom for years. From age 5-9, my ex husband was involved in his parenting, less and less as time went on. And one day when my son was 9, he just didn't show up to get my son on his weekend--complete abandonment with no warning or explanation. He later voluntarily terminated his parental rights so he wouldn't have to pay the $18k in back child support he owed. So it's just been me and my son for the past 8+ years--no alimony, no child support.  When my son was young, he was a model child--sweet &amp; kind, smart, funny, social, great grades, etc. No parent could have asked for a better child. We were very close and loving with each other.  But since my son turned 12, it's been a different story. I know some of this is just typical teen stuff for sure, but some of it isn't and it can be extreme at times.  My ex husband is a psychopath. Very briefly, he and his new GF (who I caught him cheating with) made my life a living hell for YEARS. He dragged me back to court over and over for no reason--just to screw with me, my state of mind, my finances, and my professional reputation. I didn't do anything to bring this on and tried to be as amicable as possible, but it was a game to him. He was making $130k at the time we split and I had just restarted my career after years as a SAHM, so our finances were in no way equal. He devastated me financially and emotionally because I had to hire a lawyer to defend myself and keep my custody rights. He lost every single court battle and kept switching attorneys, leaving a trail of debt behind him.  In the end, I prevailed but it cost me $20k that I didn't have in order to do so.  Just a small list of what my ex husband did to me: slashed my tires in a church parking lot while my son and I were in a cubscout meeting, threw a gallon of blood red paint on my garage door, brought multiple frivolous legal actions (I ""lived"" at the court house), stalked me in a rental car, sent me over abusive text messages (at a time when phones couldn't block callers), came to my house with a handgun and wouldn't leave until he was arrested, kidnapped my son from grade school on a day that wasn't his without notifying me (he was arrested for that), then in retaliation he had me arrested on false charges of communicating threats to his GF, libeled me to my colleagues about it, and left copies of ""The Blotter"" rag containing my mugshot in all my neighbors' paper boxes, etc etc etc. Imagine the WORST divorce you can and multiply it by and that's what it was.  I hid nearly all of this from my son to the very best of my ability. He may have known there were a few strange things going on, but he didn't know it that his father was doing it. And I've never told him, or badmouthed his father in any way, because my lawyer told me to take the high road and it was the right thing to do. My son and I just don't talk about his father or even mention him except in passing very occasionally.  My son is extremely intelligent--IQ over 140, has always tested well and straight A grades come easily to him. He thinks he's smarter than everyone (including me) and he probably is, but he lacks wisdom (as all teens do). He started smoking weed when he was and not too long after, psychedelics. He's honest with me about those things and I haven't come down too hard on him about it because I knew he'd just do it behind my back if I forbid it and the cat was already out of the bag and wasn't going back in. To my knowledge, he's never done any other drugs. And he's maintained his grades (all honors and AP classes--ranks near top of his class).  He's also popular--lots of friends (but it seems like most of them are losers) and he's had his share of GFs too.  Our house has always been the designated sleepover house. On any given weekend, there are 3-teen boys here. I've always been kind and friendly to his friends. We live in the same house we've lived in since my son was years old, even though it's been very hard financially at times for me to keep up with it, and that's especially true since covid. The bills always get paid, he always has healthy home-cooked meals, he always has clean clothes to wear, I've always been involved with his school and gone to his school functions, etc. In other words, I'm a great mom.  But here's the problem. My son is an asshole. I feel used. I feel like nothing but a free vending machine to him. He's rude and contemptuous for no reason. I'm not a lazy or stupid or mean person--I'm kind and loving, smart, and hardworking. He has absolutely no appreciation for me or the things I do for him. I don't coddle him--he has chores and a job, and pays for his own gas money etc. But he did destroy my car by not putting any oil in it and I had to buy another (used) one--he paid me for about half of it but then he got in a fender bender and the car needed repairs so now he's back to owning none of it because I had to pay for that since he didn't have the money.  I have another old car that I drive.  I will admit that I have a tendency to forgive quickly and want things to go back to normal.  I sometimes allow him to get out of grounding early in exchange for extra chores.  I don't like being a hardass mom, and compared to some other parents I am a hardass, but I feel that maybe I'm a bit too soft at times.  My natural state is to be kind and loving, and it's very difficult for me to maintain being hard for very long.  I feel that some of this is my fault in that I had a live-in BF for awhile who was mildly emotionally abusive--moody and just mean at times.  He did not act as a stepfather to my son--they had very few interactions and just ignored/tolerated each other.  My son may have picked up some of his qualities.  One of my son's best friends (who I had treated like my own son) was extremely rude and disrespectful to me after I had taken him on a trip and paid for it (and it wasn't the first time). My son took his friend's side, and even after I banned this friend from our house (I didn't ban their friendship), he invited him back months later and when I found him here I made him leave (big scene with the friend calling me a ""fucking bitch"" etc).  I suspect the boys had been drinking.  My son has also admitted that he's had alcohol multiple times (just like most teens I guess). This just happened days ago.  My son doesn't understand why I was so upset that he invited his banned friend back.  He gaslighted me--""it was not big deal"" (it was), ""I thought it was water under the bridge"" and ""You're overreacting.""  This is typical for my son--if I'm ever upset for (very legitimate) reasons he always tries to downplay it and make me feel that I'm in the wrong.   Once when we got into a huge argument, he pinned my hands above my head against the wall and screamed in my face for minutes.  I couldn't move, I told him to let me go and he wouldn't.  I was afraid he might kill me.  He later apologized and swore he'd never do it again (and he hasn't) but I feel he only did that so I wouldn't have him arrested or send him to military school etc.  That's how I always feel--that he's just manipulating me to get whatever he wants and that he has no real love for me.  I tried to get him into counseling after this incident, but once the counselor found out that I knew my son smoked weed, her supervisor told her that she had to end the relationship because I was essentially condoning illegal behavior, and that was a legal risk for them.  I'm not condoning it, but I know I can't stop it so I don't try.  The counselor told me off the record that she understood my perspective and wished she could treat my son, but it was a legal issue so she couldn't.  I have not pursued any other counselor because the legal issues would be the same if we told the truth, and what's the point of counseling if you can't be honest?  I don't THINK my son is a psychopath like his father, but I wonder.  He never seems to have any empathy or understanding for my perspective.  He just uses me to get whatever he wants, and beyond that he doesn't seem to care about me at all.  He hasn't bought me birthday or mother's day or xmas gifts in several years, despite having the money, or if he has it's because I asked him to and told him exactly what I wanted--it wasn't done spontaneously out of love.  Some of this is definitely exacerbated by covid because school is virtual right now--I let him sleep in as late as he can, but when I bring him tea in bed every morning, he usually yells at me for waking him up.

Is PTSD as a parent a thing?,"My (42M) nearly-15 year old son had cancer as an infant, was diagnosed early on the spectrum, currently would be best characterized as ADHD/ODD/depression with some level of suicidal ideation and will voluntarily do nothing outside of video games and his discord social network.  He started high school (hybrid at this point) at a fairly prestigious private school with a dynamic community and lots of activities to get involved with.  He quit debate within the first week because it was boring online (and cut into video game time).  Any suggestion I make on literally anything is met with full throated yelling, going 0 to 60 in the time it takes me to finish a sentence.  His 9 year old sister is, thankfully, neurotypical and pretty easy going.  Their mother and I are divorced 2 years and my support group from family and friends is nonexistent.  Part of me thinks my son knows I have finite emotional energy to expend and he just yells and protests relentlessly until I cave.  He is seeing a therapist and we’re trying medications.  Meanwhile, I am working on my own meditation and mindfulness practice and work hard on taking care of myself physically and emotionally, but to say that there is absolutely no joy I experience in parenting is an understatement.  I think most people would feel overwhelmed dealing with a teenager as difficult as my son at times, but I am positively drowning and honestly, the highlight of my week is dropping him off at his mom’s house (as horrible as that is to say).  I know I have to just suck it up to a large extent and do the best I can, but I’m entertaining all suggestions at this point.",0,"Is PTSD as a parent a thing?

How to Stop Getting Angry at My Teen,"I am the mother of a 16 year old girl and we are CONSTANTLY fighting.  I have come to the conclusion that I am the problem in our relationship.  Everything she does is extremely triggering to me and causes me to get very angry.  I start yelling, she yells back, and then I get mad at her for disrespecting me.  It escalates into this huge argument and then my husband has to get involved.  

Example:   I do not like her friends, her choice in boys, her music (Megan Thee Stallion - really??),  I cannot stand when she sits and takes selfies of herself 24/7 and that she has 3 devices going at any given time, etc.  Logically I know she is a teenager and she will try different things.  I think it is because I used to be so proud of her, she is an excellent athlete and was an excellent student.  Now I am embarrassed of her behavior.

Yes, we both are already in therapy.  I am seeking tools to stop myself from feeling so angry at the drop of a hat. How do I stop reacting to whatever she says or does?  I  have anxiety over her and cannot sleep at night.  Any advice would be very helpful.",0,"How to Stop Getting Angry at My Teen I am the mother of a year old girl and we are CONSTANTLY fighting.

My 17 yro wants to forgo college and marry his online gf of 7 months,"I’m so sorry for the length but it’s about my son who’s been an absolute joy to raise and is truly a sweet kid. He’s introspective so I think there’s something I can say or do that would help him see the mistake of not going to college.  Thanks so much in advance.

My son is 17, 18 next month, and just graduated HS. He’s a smart kid and has done very well academically but does NOT enjoy school. He graduated with an Honors Diploma and some college credits. Up until recently, he wanted to study aerospace engineering and could reasonably expect to get into any college he applies to. (He has not applied to schools yet bc when school went online, we decided he should graduate a year early so we could leave NYC. He missed application deadlines bc he didn’t know he’d be graduating until after they passed.)

He met a girl online and they’ve been in a relationship for 7 months. She lives in another country and bc of the travel bans, he hasn’t been able to meet her in person. She’s a sweet girl and they spend almost every waking hour on FaceTime calls. She is also a bright kid and originally wanted to be a dermatologist. 

He’s planned a life with her and now he no longer wants to go to college, nor does she. He wants to go to a trade school, get married and live in an RV until they save enough money to put down on a house and have tons of babies. I think the RV is a cool idea, tbh. They plan on living a “tradcath” (tradition catholic) lifestyle which, if I understand correctly, he’ll be responsible for the income and she will manage the house and children. (She does plan to work up until they have kids but would not be able to work in the states until she receives a green card which takes over a year.) They’re putting religion high up on the priorities list. Prior to meeting her, he was an atheist. I am an atheist too but fully support him going through this conversion. I’m looking forward to attending his baptism and confirmation in April. 

I have major concerns about *some* of these choices. I’m disappointed he no longer wants to go to college. I’m uncomfortable with her not wanting to go college and wanting instead to be a housewife to someone who’s not able to take care of himself yet. She’s moving to a whole different country and putting faith into someone who is essentially still a fully dependent child. Also, the amount of responsibility he’s taking on at such a young age is a lot for anyone. I’m concerned they’re going to “accidentally” get pregnant before having a house. I’m worried that if she comes over to the US on a K1 visa that he’ll be financially responsible for her for the next 10 years. I’m embarrassed to tell family and friends that he has a girlfriend he’s never met but plans to marry this summer after online dating for 1/2 a year. I’m worried that she’ll be bored/lonely in an RV all day while he’s out working. I’m worried that her parents seem to support her plans when she’s 17 and a senior in HS still?! (This 100% for sure is not about a green card. She lives in a great country and could come over on a student visa with no problems.)

I’ve been trying for the last 4 months to get him into counseling but no one is taking a 17 yro thats about to turn 18. I have an appointment lined up for him once he turns 18 next month.

I’m torn. I know he’s going to do whatever he wants so I don’t want to alienate him but I also don’t want to under-intervene and miss my chance to get him to go to college. We’ve talked extensively about this but his ADHD brain is only seeing the fruit of his labors, not the amount of labor he’s got to put in for his vision to come into fruition. 

*He cannot see any problems coming up that would change their feelings for each other.*

I think she’s a lovely girl and they make each other happy. I’m glad they met and I hope they do live a happily ever after. It would be nice if she came over on a student Visa and they got to know each other in person before committing to marriage. But there wouldn’t be any premarital sex (by her choice, and he supports this) so there’s a sense of urgency to tie the knot. 

Is there anything else I can say or do that might convince him to go to college and slow down their plans? He’s already asked if they can live with me while they go to college and I said no. Which is why they’re going the RV route with him opting for the apprenticeship/trade route. 

I’m honestly thinking about buying a patch of land behind my house and letting them setup shop in their RV there if they go to college. On one hand I feel like any significant help I give will be bc they’ve essentially exploited my desire to ensure he grows into a functioning adult but on the other hand, I know he’s not doing this *to me* but rather wanting to do this for himself.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

How to make distance learning less stressful for a middle schooler?,"My younger 4 kids are doing full time distance learning. They are in 8th grade, 7th grade, 4th grade, and 1st grade. Before the school year we went back to school shopping so they could set up their work from home areas however they wanted. All 4 of them are set up in our finished basement and I stay down there most of the day just in case anyone needs me. They all have their own chrome books and noise canceling headphones. They also all have their zoom schedules at their desk and calendars to write due dates. 

All of them are doing okay but my 13 year old is getting really stressed out. Last week he asked if he could take a break and I had no problem allowing it but on Monday I could see that he was getting himself worked up. He didn't complain or ask for a break. He just sat there but I could tell by the look on his face that he was about to lose it. I went over to him and told him to take a break. He almost never cries but his eyes were teary and he didn't say anything to me as he got up. When he came back he was better but later that night he had a hard time sleeping. He came into my room a little before midnight and asked if I could sit up with him for a little bit. We ended up sitting at our dining room table talking and he told me that school this year is so stressful and how he wants to go back. He has always struggled with school because of his dyslexia and ADHD but last year was his best year ever and he's afraid all that he's going to fall behind again. He also isn't doing his normal extracurriculars. In the fall he plays football and he does orchestra all year long. Football season was canceled and orchestra is hard to do on his own so he hasn't been practicing his cello. Football helps his confidence and gets his energy out and playing the cello is somewhat therapeutic for his dyslexia so not doing either isn't helping. He has an IEP and all of his long reading assignments give him the option of having it read to him but he is still getting work assigned from each teacher everyday and I think it's just getting to him at this point. Any tips or tricks that are working for your middle schoolers?",0,"How to make distance learning less stressful for a middle schooler? My younger kids are doing full time distance learning.

Teen runs away when I punish her. Is asking to go to a 3-day sleepover this weekend?,"I know I have lost control. She is almost 16 and we are in a hot zone here. She wants to go to a 3-day co-ed sleepover because ""dad lets her!"". Dad and I have separate rules mostly because dad is depressed and is going through a divorce. I loved his wife who enforced ALL rules. She is now gone due to his depression and lack of parenting.

Our teen senses this tension and uses it. He lets her go on these co-ed sleepovers and I do not. The friend hosting the sleepover is dating a 30 year old man and my child told me before she does not approve. Lately, she thinks this is ok. This child's parents also include alcohol at all sleepovers (more like parties) and my child also told me in the past this was against her morals. Now, it seems ok with her. We have a very open relationship, UNTIL I say the word ""NO"".

She has lashed out and called rides to pick her up on school nights when I have told her she simply can not go out due to her grades. She had 3 F's in the middle of last school year. She calls these people's parent's and tells them she is allowed to go and flies out the door (the doorway and our street are about 15 steps away) before I can say a word.

I called the police the first 2 times and they said ""Just let her go"". and ""There is nothing we can do"".

Last night at 10pm, I received an email from her teacher. 12 assignments are missing already after only 1 month of school. She has an F in Algebra.

I refuse to let her go to this sleepover this weekend. She needs to work on all of these assignments. It is my custodial weekend. However, I am worried she will repeat her past behavior of calling a friend and leaving. She has no concern for her future. My ex does not care and says she is a ""perfect angel"" at his house because he allows her to do whatever she wants!

Thoughts? I was wondering if I should make a list for her to see the reasons she can't go this weekend but I know that will blow up on me. I need help. Thanks.",0,"Teen runs away when I punish her.

Have we failed as parents,"Sorry for the very very long read I have a lot to say and a lot of questions so I do apologize in advance.

I feel like such a failure as a parent and I honestly don't know what to do for my 17 year old son.

School has always been hard for him all the way back to kindergarten.  He was a slow learner/developer.  He was put on an IEP to help him in school, which did help through 5th grade.  Then middle school hit and he was bullied.  His mood and attitude changed when that started and we could tell something was wrong, but he would not tell us what.  Finally, towards the end of sixth grade he said that he was being bullied. I contacted the school principal to let her know and she did some investigating and found out that yes indeed he was being bullied and separated the offender from my son putting him into a completely different class so that my son wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. However the bullying continued all the way up through his now senior year in high school he has told us a few times of it happening and each time I have reached out to either the school counselor or the principal to voice my concerns and adjustments were made to his schedule or the offenders schedule. My son continues to struggle with school, he has at numerous times through high school fallen way behind and gotten D's and f's. He usually has C's B's or I should say had, during middle school and up until last year, junior year.  Knowing that he has always struggled our stance with him as always been as long as he tried and did his best, we didn't care about the grades.  

Then COVID hit right as they went on Spring break and would not return to school (still hasn't).  He had a girlfriend at the time, but that relationship turned bad after about a month of not being able to see each other. They started getting into arguments and fights over the stupidest things.  I don't know the full story but I have my suspicions that she was just using him. she would tell him oh yeah let's get together on such and such day or at such and such time and then an hour or two before would cancel saying oh my dad won't let me leave the house or I'm not feeling good. And it happened every single time they made plans to get together and they never actually could end up seeing each other. This left my son very heartbroken and lonely. It got to the point where he was saying things about dying but not saying that he would kill himself or hurt himself. He would say like I wish I wasn't here anymore or I wish I could just fly out into outer space and become a Star wars hero, he loves Star Wars by the way. I got him in to speak to a counselor because he was depressed really. The counselor was of no help.  We saw him 3 times.  Twice in person, then one via video once COVID shut down.  The only thing he wanted him to do was to practice some breathing exercises to help him relax so he can sleep better because if he could sleep better that would help with his depression. I don't know if that's true or not I'm not a therapist so I can't say for sure but that just to me didn't seem the right thing but who knows. After talking to his primary doctor she reluctantly put him on an antidepressant which he's been on for 6 weeks now and is showing signs of improvement but still has some setbacks here and there.

We are at a point in school his senior year he is so far behind on all of his work because he's just not doing the work because of being depressed and not wanting to do have anything to do with school or anything that reminds him of school or his ex-girlfriend.he has f's in every single class because of the amount of work that is missing plus he has what they call credit recovery from classes that he has failed in previous years that he has yet to work on as it stands right now he will not be graduating. And this is where I feel I have failed as a parent,  I don't know what to do,  he has repeatedly asked me, sometimes in tears sometimes not,  but very seriously has asked me if he can just drop out of school because it is just too much and too hard.  I was trying to help him with some work last night to start getting caught up and in frustration he said I give up either I'm going to die or I'm going to quit school but I'm not doing this anymore.  I, as his father, have cried over this to the point where I think I am creating a lot of stress for myself which is affecting my health.

He has no desire to get a driver's license mainly because studying for the driving test is too hard for him he doesn't know how to take notes properly he can't really remember stuff that he has read in the manual. So he hasn't even really gone past chapter one in our states driver handbook. He also has no desire to get a job and I have told him repeatedly he needs to get a job and make money and by doing that getting out of the house which will help him with his depression. But he just refuses wants to just sit at home veg and play video games.  I've tried threatening to ground him take away his Xbox his phone his tablet all of his electronic devices and he doesn't respond he literally the last time I did that unplugged everything and put everything on her bed and said sell it I don't care anymore, then he sinks deeper into depression and I get very worried that he will do something drastic, so I don't push him.  Am I failing as his father by not being stern with him?  Or am I taking the right approach by backing off, since he is depressed and make comments about wanting to die or no longer be here.  He even asked me a couple of weeks ago if we can basically fake his death and tell the world that he no longer is alive and he would then wear Star wars clone army get up went out in public so that nobody would know it was actually him.

He refuses to go see a therapist because of what happened with the first one then I have told him repeatedly that I am not going to let that happen again when we go see his somebody new I will make sure that they are going to take care of his needs and not just try to brush him off with sleeping exercises or meditation yeah I'm sure some of that does work but he needs something different. However he still refuses to go see a therapist.  

Do I just let him quit school and drop out and take a lot of that stress away from him for now and then work on getting him his driver's license so that he can get a job so he can be productive in society and get out of the house or do I push the issue and tell him you're not dropping out you will finish school?  I know there are skill jobs that do not require high school diplomas. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I ask her a few questions but her speech was all slurred and she walking all over the place. I figured she was drinking and went to smell her breath but I didn’t smell anything. I tried to communicate with her for an hour which left me in tears because she was practically unresponsive and moved around like a zombie and looked extremely tired. I put her to bed and stayed up all night to keep an eye on her. 

Monday morning she wakes up and does not remember a single thing from the night before. At that point, it was clear what she was taking and made her admit it. I don’t know how she got possession of them or who even gave them to her. For right now, I banned all electronics and other privileges until I find a plan. I’m not sure what to do from here? Do I bring her to therapy? Keep her grounded?",0,"Daughter is on Xanax This happened on Sunday night when she was  late from her curfew which is 12am.

How do you raise children to not quit?,"My 15 year old daughter has been dancing competitively since she was 3. Her original dance studio closed down due to covid and now she is enrolled in a new studio with different teaching styles.

But what can I do to convince her to give the new studio a chance. We’ve talked to the studio director and she was placed in the lower level classes to be with her friend, but my daughter is still considering quitting at the end of October.

Can you help me brainstorm ideas for celebrating a teenager's birthday under quarantine?,"My daughter is about to turn 15, and is very sad that she might not be able to have an in-person party.  Also, her birthday is the day after Halloween, and those two things have always been combined into one giant sugar-filled celebration of insanity, and this year we're not sure trick or treating will be an option.  (She's also considering the idea that she might be too old for trick or treating, but she still wants candy.  Meanwhile, her 18yo brother, who was supposed to be away at college, but deferred it till next year, is perfectly happy to put on a costume and go door to door...)  

She's been doing distance learning and is so sick of Zoom, but I think a Zoom get-together is probably our best bet.  I've had a couple of ideas about how to make it fun:  
1. Make it a costume party.  
2. Before the party, drop off a cupcake and a goody bag on the porch of all the invited guests.  
3. Maybe create a fun Kahoot quiz that everyone can do from home?  

And that's all I've got.  I'd love to hear any ideas you guys have!

"To parent or not to parent, that is the question","I am 24 and my husband is 25, and we recently took on his 17 year old sister to live in our house and attend the school where I teach while her mother lives out of state.

Explaining College to my Daughter,"My daughter is a junior in high school, and my husband and I have been ramping up the college conversation with her for the past year. She really has her sights set on one school: MIT. For background, my husband and I both went there, but legacy status is not considered in admissions. Also, from working in college admissions for several years, I don't think she would get in, because although she is female and has great grades and test scores, her extracurriculars are only okay, and she is an upper-middle class Asian-American. There are three things that I need to make crystal clear to her, and I am not sure how. 1. College admissions have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY more competitive since your father and I were kids, so you should not compare yourself to us based on college admissions. Nowadays, it is kind of a crapshoot wherever you apply, and you need to know that you shouldn't consider what college you go to the only result of your childhood. 2. Even though you have great test scores, they might not even be considered, and even if they are, you will be held to a higher standard as an upper-middle class Asian-American who is interested in STEM. 3.

We started talking every day and he came to my town(2hrs drive) to buy my a bycycle. Everything is going good we dicided that I go to his place on summer break. Everyday was good, I was promised a new computer(I didnt get it in the end) and he was saying im a best child ever. On 3rd night he was drunk like a last 2 nights and decided to call my mom and tell her that im the best son ever. 1hour later he calls my mom to say that im the worst child ever because I screamed at him to not talk about s\*x every 15 minutes. So everyday my dad and I would watch Tv and every time he would say when comercial pops up ''look at those legs'', I am uncomftrable and I tell him that every single time but he just said he was joking and that I cant take a joke. He would also talk about how women are only for cleaning, cooking and having s\*x with. He would always told me that, because I dont have a girlfriend that im emberasing him because he is the biggest fuc\*\*er in my country and that he was getting laid at my age. I dont like when he talks about women like that, because my mom is a women and she cooked, cleaned, give her life in the last ten years and she raised me up and still is raising me up to dont be a alcoholic lying piece of tr\*sh. He called his girlfriend to drive my and him to my city at 1am. In the car ride she was telling me I should apologise to him and he was telling me that I will regret this day. In the proces she told me that she was living with him for five years, I wasnt supposed to hear that because my dad looked pissed at her. Even after I told her he was telling me about all night stands he has, she just told me that thats how he is.

I (26F) and my husband (31F) are raising my sister (16) alone.,"I’m worried this post will be buried but even if one person is able to offer some advice i would be so grateful. 

My husband and I are the legal guardians of my sister. TLDR, our family sucks. Our mom died from substance abuse when my sister was 13. My dad sucks too. He only cares about his wife and his big paychecks. He willingly gave my sister to us because she has mental health issues like self harm and depression and he didn’t want to deal with it. 

I don’t want to ramble but my husband and I have sacrificed so much to provide for my sister. We have bent over backwards endlessly to help her grow, to support her, to get her the mental health help she needs. She was grounded for two weeks for bringing her bf over without permission three times in a week. (Among other behavioral issues.) Two days before she was to be un-grounded we found she’d been using a trap phone to talk to him and see him anyway. We extended the grounding for a week. Then five days after that we found three more trap phones shed hidden in her room. We also got a call from her bf and his mom saying my sister told them she was going to kill her self. Honestly these suicide threats are not unusual for her. She’s threatened this so many times when she’s been grounded for very justifiable reasons like above. But long story short she had to be Baker Acted last night and is in a behavioral health in patient center for a few days. We’ve done so much to help her  (including getting her on antidepressants and getting her a counselor) but she needs even more than we can provide. I just hope so much she’ll actually put in effort to get better but based on her history I don’t think she will. Which sucks tremendously. 

Idk I guess I’m looking for any advice or recommendations for books on parenting troubled teens. It’s hard because I’m not her mom. The relationship isn’t the same and some basic parenting stuff doesn’t apply. I basically got this weird promotion to parent figure, but we are used to being best friends. Idk. I feel like I’ve tried everything for her. But the level of betrayal I feel because of her constant lies and deceit is going to make this all even harder (she lies about literally everything). How can we even move forward let alone figure out how tf to keep parenting her? I can’t give up on her but I’m at the end of my rope.

Loss of the child when the teenager arrives,"My daughter turned 13 this year and she started her periods a few months before that. Her whole life she had been a very affectionate girl, often showering me with loving words and affection completely unprompted even as recently as the end of last year/start of this year. I was a single parent and she is my only child and the bond between us was very strong.

When her periods started it was like a switch had been flicked from child to teenager. It took just weeks for a complete change. She never offers affection anymore and is often reluctant to reciprocate hugs. She spends most free time in her room but to be fair to her during the brief times she comes out she can be good humoured and we can have a laugh. 

I’m sure her behaviour is all normal and nothing to worry about but the thing is I feel like I’m grieving. She’s my only child and I feel like that child has gone now. Of course I love the girl she is now to bits but I sometimes think I’m not just grieving the loss of one child but many - there were so many different versions of her through the years and my heart breaks knowing I’ll never see any of them again. Of course it’s right that she grows up and goes forth into the world - she’s overcome serious health problems in the past and I was worried she might not make it and so her growing up as she should is wonderful. But I still miss all those other girls.

I just wondered if there is something wrong with me for feeling like this. And if there was a way I could stop. I sometimes fantasise that I could have one of her for each year of her life and spend Groundhog Day with all of them forever. What’s wrong with me?",0,"Loss of the child when the teenager arrives My daughter turned this year and she started her periods a few months before that.

What to share with teens therapist about spouse?,"My late teen, who is generally very stable, is in therapy requested by her.  She has learned to stay away from her father to avoid being yelled at or emotionally hurt in some other way.  Despite (or because of) this, The therapist is trying to help her develop a better relationship with her father, which normally would be wonderful.  I like the therapist and trust her motives but suspect she does not trust daughters assessment of her father.  My spouse and I are married but staying together for financial reasons until the kids are grown.  My spouse is a narcissist and can be vindictive.  He is in therapy, but I feel that the therapy has been functioning to teach how to mask his trueself/ behaviors (it is amazing what one learns when they see their spouse work from home and see how they interact with other people) rather than actually gain understanding.  I am afraid that he now knows that a relationship with him is important to daughter that he will find some way to use this against her.  As parents, spouse and I have met with therapist twice, but always with both of us so I feel I can’t speak freely about this in front of him.  I am not sure how much information I should share as I don’t want to overstep the bounds or prejudice the therapy but I also don’t want her to be hurt by him again.  I am looking to hear any stories from people who have been in this situation, how they moved forward and what the outcomes were.  Do I share his nature with the therapist or do I let daughter work that out even if it concludes in a negative manor?  

Just to head things off:  no discussion about why we are still together or what happened prior to this point, spouse is a good provider, not physically abusive, we will be together until daughter finished first few college years.",0,"What to share with teens therapist about spouse?

Empty nesting thinking of adding to the family,Hi my Boys are 16 and 18 I am blessed they are great kids or Rather young adults. I was a young mother. Both my Boys were planned pregnancy.

My youngest was born 2 years latter with in months of His birth I developed inoperable cysts on my ovaries and my health declined So I was unable to have the third Child I dreamed of. I have always tried to be positive about my health and Infertility issues I realize I am blessed to have 2 perfect kids but the older they get the more the ache of Baby hunger or fever comes back. I feel like I am missing some one very important in my life like there's a blank spot. Where some unknown Child belongs to are family. I've thought about adoption or surrogacy. The dilemma comes in when I take into account my Partners age he will be 50 this year to my 38. Alzheimer's runs in his family Nearly every One of his mother's siblings have been effected by the age of 75. We had genetic testing done and was told yes he carries the gean but there is only a 50 percent chance he will get it. The other Issue is I swore I wouldn't raise my kids as only Children I am an only child and I hated it I feel like I missed alot not having that sibling bond. I know that if we adopted or used a surrogate I would not only be starting over but my Future Child would basically be an only child. Basically my Brain and heart are in conflict. So my question is are there other almost empty nesters going thru the same thing. Am  I needlessly letting a maybe diagnosis stop me from completing are family? We have had extended family go thru loosing a spouse to Alzheimer's. When children were young it was Horrible. Also I've been told that this late life baby fever is Hormonal and will subside in a year or two when I get closer to menopause.

"Found sons THC cartridge, don’t know how to discipline","So I’m not sure if I messed up or not by finding this, and honestly don’t know what to do. So a few days ago my 17 year old son wasn’t at home and I was putting some clothes up in his room. I noticed a small orange thing on the ground, after inspecting it, it seemed to be an ecstasy tablet. I wasn’t completely sure but was confused, as I’ve only known of him smoking marijuana and that was over a year ago. 

After searching through his room for a few minutes, I found a small box in the top of his closet with an almost full THC cartridge(which I couldn’t identify at the time). So when my son got back, I asked him what both the tablet and vape are. He didn’t know what the tablet is, but told me that the vape is a THC cartridge that he’s had for months but barely used. We later confirmed the identity of the tablet as a shaped sprinkle that came from a brand of cookies we usually buy. 

He told me that the vape was to relax occasionally, and that he only uses it on some weekends to not affect school. He also explained how when used in moderation, it won’t affect his “hippocampus” and memory. I believe him when it comes to not using it much, because he’s usually really close on weekdays but on some recent weekends, he’s distant and I don’t see him too much. I’m still not sure about it causing brain damage, he seemed confident about his information. Yet I’m still holding onto the vape and don’t know what to do with it. 

On one hand I don’t want him to resent me or be secretive for not giving him privacy and searching his room, yet I want to be assertive and unbiased. The time I found him smoking marijuana and grounded him a year ago, he went through a rebellious phase. And at this age it could be counterproductive to possibly put him in that phase because it could cause worse actions than without it. 

I appreciate any responses, thanks. 

TLDR: I found a weirdly shaped sprinkle on the ground of my 17 year old sons room, thought it was ecstasy, searched his room and found an almost full THC cartridge that he had had for quite some time. He proved that it was only used in moderation, and to relax occasionally. I don’t want him to get very secretive or go through a rebellious phase so I’m still holding onto it, I also want to be assertive but I’m still not entirely sure what to do. Thanks",0,"Found sons THC cartridge, don’t know how to discipline So I’m not sure if I messed up or not by finding this, and honestly don’t know what to do. So a few days ago my year old son wasn’t at home and I was putting some clothes up in his room. I noticed a small orange thing on the ground, after inspecting it, it seemed to be an ecstasy tablet. I wasn’t completely sure but was confused, as I’ve only known of him smoking marijuana and that was over a year ago.   After searching through his room for a few minutes, I found a small box in the top of his closet with an almost full THC cartridge(which I couldn’t identify at the time). So when my son got back, I asked him what both the tablet and vape are. He didn’t know what the tablet is, but told me that the vape is a THC cartridge that he’s had for months but barely used. We later confirmed the identity of the tablet as a shaped sprinkle that came from a brand of cookies we usually buy.   He told me that the vape was to relax occasionally, and that he only uses it on some weekends to not affect school. He also explained how when used in moderation, it won’t affect his “hippocampus” and memory. I believe him when it comes to not using it much, because he’s usually really close on weekdays but on some recent weekends, he’s distant and I don’t see him too much. I’m still not sure about it causing brain damage, he seemed confident about his information. Yet I’m still holding onto the vape and don’t know what to do with it.   On one hand I don’t want him to resent me or be secretive for not giving him privacy and searching his room, yet I want to be assertive and unbiased.

Defiant adolescent and confused parent,"My daughter (16) got very upset with me. I apologized and explained why I did something, but she is still mad.
For four days, I asked her to clean the rat cage. They had no water, food and the cage was full of poop and urine. I was concerned about their health because I could smell it though the house. She would say, ""I got it"" but she'll forget and do other things. On the fourth day, I was a lot more persistent because I know their condition was get tong unhealthy. She said that if I buy her another rat, she will clean the cage.
I got angry and said that she should not have pets if she sees them as a collection item and fail to take care of them. This made her cry and attack me.
It was my fault. I shouldn't have told her what I thought because she now thinks I'm mistreating her. She believes that I am treating her like a servant. I don't think that's true because I don't give her chores. Her only responsibility is to take care of the rats because I understand she is very sensitive.
She wants to live with her father and in her perspective, if she can't discipline me by taking my phone away if I dont do something, I have no right to discipline her by taking the rats.
My post sounds very passive, but I am trying to get into her mindset and not come across as insensitive.

Best parental monitoring apps for kid’s cell phone?,"First, about us: I have two kids, Boy (10) and Girl (13). Their mom has primary custody. They live here with me at least one stretch per week.

Girl got a cell phone for her 13th birthday, despite my protestations. You don’t give a new driver a Ferrari, maybe a 20 year old truck. “I just want her to be normal and popular” was her mom’s argument.

Won’t bore you with details but it came out today that Girl has multiple TikTok and Insta accounts. I looked through the TikTok vids and while most are funny, cute, playful, some cross the line for me (E.g., clumsy quasi-erotic dancing to “WAP,” etc). 

Her mom has claimed in the past that she “has it all under control” using some app for parents for her to monitor what Girl does on her phone. I guess the Chris Brown song about “I’m tryna fuck you and not have a baby” slipped past.

I am an Aurelian stoic, and a very hands-off parent when it comes to my kids’ education in the world. Yes, I will protect you, I will teach you, I will guide you, but “Go outside, poke a snake, get some scratches, and don’t come in until supper time.” I do believe that is a fine way to allow children to learn their strengths and weaknesses. 

However, here I am at an impasse. I worry about this new cyber landscape where my 13 year old has 500 followers on a TikTok account and in my (parentally paranoid) mind , half are grown men. 

Are there parenting apps you’d recommend so I can be more in the know about this stuff?

Pulling back for the larger picture, any thoughts on how to teach a new adult all about the strengths and weaknesses of this powerful pocket computer she has?

Advice on teenage girl aged out of foster care in California?,"Firing up the throwaway account to keep this anonymous.

We live in one of the fire affected areas in CA and we currently have a couple of evacuees staying with us. This is a very, very long story made short but one of them is an 18 year old girl who has recently aged out of the foster care system and it’s become very clear to my wife and I that she does not yet have the life skills or support system to make it on her own. Her recent years have simply been a complete sh\*t show of one terrible event after another (dad suicide,  mom drug addict. enough said).  


It looks like she’ll be living with us for a while as she has nowhere else to go. if any of you have any insight or experience with kids aging out of the system (especially in CA) and what resources are available we would be eternally grateful. We have a son and I don’t know much about raising/supporting girls,  any advice (big or small) on how we make this as safe and comfortable for her as possible would be beyond welcome.

Note: this may seem like a bit of an arrogant assumption but every friend and family member we’ve discussed this with has said something along the lines of “it’s wonderful that you would help her” and told us ""what a great thing"" we are doing etc...  Please don’t, we are not doing anything great or wonderful, we simply have been presented with a young person who is in a horrible situation and I fully believe any functioning adult would do what we are doing if they were in our position.

Can anyone give any tips to 1) Motivate her to learn and 2) advise which techniques to use to start riding on her own?

How to calculate the proper monthly allowance for a 16yo,"I am the noncustodial parent of a wonderful 16yo. Child support is all very well, but I do think it's important to teach her how to handle her own money. That includes letting her make her own mistakes with her own money. That means she needs her own money. (Forgive me if I'm stating the obvious.)

Should the amount be calculated via my own income, the joint income of my household, the age of the child, or something else? I think $100/month is okay, but she has some expensive hobbies — beekeeping, for instance — that I want to support.

So far, she is the opposite of a spoiled brat. As a former spoiled brat, I can tell. However, I don't want her to think that money falls out of the sky. Also, I've no desire to undermine the custodial parent. If I send too much money, I'll look like a Disneyland Dad; that would be bad for everyone.

Need help raising my sister,"Hello. This is going to be long. To give you guys some background first- I am 21, me and my fiancé have taken in my two siblings (15 &amp; 16) this past year. Their father was physically and mentally abusive growing up, and when we were with my mother, which was barely, she was also mentally abusive. Things seems almost too good to be true when we first bought our home and all moved in together, and they were. Over the past 6 months things have gotten bad for me and my sister. She’s rude, disrespectful, lies about just about anything, and was constantly threatening suicide. We had family discussions and things would be okay for a week maybe two, and then we were back to square one. So I got her in to see a therapist. That also seemed to help a lot. She started driving soon after so I gave her freedom and trust and basically let her live her life. Well that backfired on me because she had a bad acid trip with her friends and ended up in the hospital strapped to the bed. We had another family discussion. About the consequences of her actions, her mental health, and how she treats others. She was grounded for 3 weeks and complained constantly. She’s been ungrounded for a little over 3 weeks now, and today we had another argument. It’s honestly a bi-weekly thing at this point. She was throwing up this morning at school (which has been going on for weeks) and said it was her anxiety. But she was out with her friends in public all weekend, so I said what’s the difference between school and being out with your friends? What triggers the anxiety? And she took it as me being mean and basically just shut down. But this was over text. Fast forward to JUST NOW, I ask her about her day at school and she’s snappy and rude with me. It escalated into a full fledged argument where she said all I do is be mean to her and make her cry.

What do I do? Please believe me when I say I have been kind, patient, and sympathetic to everything that has happened. There has been numerous incidents where I could have reacted poorly and I’ve held it together. I don’t want to be our mother and I just want to give them a better childhood than I had.

I got the best compliment about my teenage son,"Like the rest of you, I always wonder if I’m doing a good job raising my kids. Over the last few months, my son has had a lot of milestones to adulthood. He turned 16, got his driver’s license, got a car, checking and savings accounts and a JOB. Our agreement was that we would pay for the car, but he pays for the gas, insurance and start saving to cover maintenance and his insurance deductible. 

His job is a kitchen apprentice at a local and very popular breakfast and lunch restaurant. We are friends with the owners so that is how he got the job. Because it’s food service, restaurant has trouble getting and keeping good people, but there is a lot of staff that has been there for years. People don’t show up for interviews or decide at the test shift, they can’t handle the pressure when people are lined up out the door. The restaurant owners joked that they wanted to hire my son because he would show up. Well, 3rd week into his job and we were eating breakfast and one of the owners pops out of the kitchen to grab something and we exchange a “Hi”. That is when he tells us that we did a good job with raising my son. He is working hard and diligently in the kitchen. This made me so happy I almost cried.

So I'm at work and I just got a text from her friend (We'll call home Bob) ""Help your daughter hacked my SC account and is spreading rumors"" why they don't just change their password I'll never know but then! He sends me a screenshot of what she did and said that ""She's trying to ruin his life"" I had already apologized to him and spoken to her about it and said that spreading rumors is not ok and to get off and we'd discuss it when I got off work. She blamed her 2 other friends M &amp; K for talking her into it and saying it'd be funny. Then I saw the screenshot shot. She posted ""I'm Gay"" on his account. Now he's really upset and I'm really upset because my daughter is usually much more level headed and kind and goes out of her way to help people so I can't understand why she'd do this!

So what do I do now? Besides talking to her about how wrong it is (any pointers on that talk would be good!) I feel like the needs punished. I think grounded from her phone but for how long? I also think M &amp; Ks parents need to know even though that will make them mad at my daughter for telling. Please help me!",0,"Help! Teen-Online-Friends issue! My daughter (13) had snapchat.

13 year old taking extra long showers. Do you put limits on shower time?,We are getting our downstairs bathroom redone which means we only have one bathroom in use.

How to help my miserable college freshman.,"My youngest went off to college two days ago, and we are now ""empty nesters"".

He texted/called today saying he hates it and asking to come home.

I can't get my teenager to stop lying,"(TL;DR at bottom - long post ahead!) I (33F) have a 14 y/o son. I know that it's normal for teenagers to lie, not give a shit about helping out, struggle with being responsible, etc. I know he's got a lot of changes that he's going through and there are a lot of hormones/emotions for him to process through. However, I also know that still doesn't excuse his behavior and he still has to have consequences for his actions.

Background: My son is in virtual school for the semester due to COVID-19. I have a job where I work weekends but have three days off during the week. My son, my boyfriend and I all live together and my boyfriend is home with my son when I'm at work. When school started, I gave my son a printed-out schedule outlining how he was supposed to spend his time during his school day and his responsibilities around the house (take trash out, empty dishwasher, sweep, etc.). He has to message me when he starts school and when he's done with school. He also has to spend an hour of his time engaging in some hobby that doesn't involve electronics (he loves video games and would spend all day doing it otherwise). 

Here's my issue. He will lie to me about being done with school and about his hour of free time so that he can sneak onto his laptop to play games. He does this when he doesn't realize my boyfriend is awake (my boyfriend has a weird sleep schedule) and thinks he can get away with it. He recently got grounded for a week for lack of responsibility. I just grounded him again yesterday for a week for lying to me about doing his hour of free time when he really didn't. I gave him four hours of electronic time on his birthday as a ""present"" and he lied about how much time he actually spent on his laptop. He informed me that grounding him just makes him want to sneak around more to play games. I told him if he continued to lie to me then I would set a rule that he would not be allowed to use his laptop for anything except school while I was at work. However, I feel at my wits' end and don't know if what I'm doing is working or I should be doing more. These games are also how he communicates with his friends and cousin (who is like his best friend) so I don't want to just permanently take that away from him. We also are a family of gamers so I understand that this is his main interest, but it becomes an issue when it takes away from him completing his responsibilities and not being honest. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Worried about teenage son?,"After some advice from outsiders please guys.  I worry about my son and I guess I am very over protective.  He is 16, I see myself in him every day and he is following the same path I went down which is hard and led me to years of anxiety and depression, he also has the disadvantage of being dyslexic.

He's an odd kid in that he has no friends as such, he like i was is painfully shy, he has no real interests as such apart from playing his Xbox.  He left school in June with the hope of doing an apprenticeship at college but with Covid he couldn't get an employer placement so my boss took pity and took him in and he's in with me for a year.  He like I was is over weight, I see my colleagues looking at him and little whispers, they wouldn't dare say anything smart to him but I know them judging looks all too well and they are judging me as well as their kids are all university graduates in fancy jobs and they do love to boast about them.

The road he is on is not easy, life generally gives you crap, I was over weight, shy, never had a girl friend until I was 20, spent most of my life putting up with crap in dead end jobs and as I say it lead me to years of depression and anxiety, I was a doormat.  It wasn't until I lost 60lbs of fat and spent 5 years in the weight room that I can now say confidently people generally don't try and walk over me.

Needing advice for dealing with my 13/m son with self confidence issues. Help?,"Hi! I’m a single mom of a 13 year old young man. He is struggling with many self love and confidence issues. I’m lost. Any advice on how to help him find his happiness and support him through this tough time? He struggles with weight and possibly depression. Men of Reddit how can I help him!?

I have an amazing teen. He was a preemie, and was a mere 3 pounder when born. He has played soccer in younger years, was involved in Boy Scouts. And last year started Jr High football. 

Since March, when school went virtual I’ve noticed him becoming withdrawn, likely borderline depressed. I’ve talked to him without being direct- and tried to find out what is bothering him.

Also since March, he has gone full blown puberty! His voice has changed and he has facial and body hair that would put some grown men to shame. I’ve invested in nice grooming care gear for him and try to encourage him to treat himself and his body as well. He is self conscious about his unibrow and we do our eyebrows as well as nail care bi-weekly to monthly.

He seems to be coming (SLOWLY) our of the funk. However, the last two days have been hard on him. Over spring/summer he outgrew his 32s, then 33s, 34s and 35 in waist pants. He is extremely upset all of the new clothes I’ve bought him aren’t fitting. 

I have been concerned he may have diabetes. His dr
Wants him to have a 5 hr GTT next month, but I’m taking I and Os, daily caloric intake, charting activities, and documentation of his polyphagia, polyuria, as well as his never ending thirst. I’m thinking he may have some insulin resistance or perhaps even childhood onset DM 1. The nurse in me worries.

Should it not be a medical issue, I know he is simply defeated by his appearance. It’s killing me to see him struggle and begin to hate his body. This kid has been through so much in his life because of me. And the guilt is awful.

We are very close and I’m thankful he opens up to me, but I’m feeling helpless. Most clothes he has are new with tags, and he doesn’t want me to return them
For larger sizes, but I honestly need to! I can’t afford to replace his wardrobe otherwise. 

In the last month, he has had stretch marks that
Are increasing daily. They’re at the red and angry stage. I tried to call his insecurities by showing him my pics from when I was cheering at his age and my
Visible stretch marks. But nothing seems to calm his fears. It is breaking my heart to watch the light fade from his eyes. The stretch marks are everywhere and started only a month ago or so.
The cover his hips, upper thight, tricep area, arm pits, inner thight, and lower belly. He is starting to have enlarged, puffy nipples as well as a classic “cortisol belly”. 

I have full physical custody of my boys. Their dad gets them when he can, but not for regular court ordered visitation. And asking for child support of $200/mo proved to be like pissing in the wind. More than the financial support, the oldest son especially is greatly affected by his dad not being around all the time, and not responding to calls and messages. I understand I need to try to step up and cover as much as I can that he’s missing from Dad- but I think you guys will agree it’s no substitute for the advice a father
Gives to his son. 


Last weekend, the older boy started hunting with some of my family. Granted, we are not as close of a family as we were most of my life, being around the men in my extended family and goin on hunts has peaked his interest and is something he has fallen in love with! This past week, I’ve been trying to get him into 4H shooting club. But I would really appreciate some advice from you guys on how I can better support my baby and help him with his issues- self esteem, as well as the void I can see he has when it comes to a male role model. 

Parenting seems the perfect community to be able to seek some good advice. Due to the pandemic, even I have had trouble getting an appointment for my therapist. The younger boy is on the spectrum and even he is having issues getting an appt for his therapist. Today, I called most of the providers that accept our Molina insurance and so far no luck. Most aren’t accepting new patients, or don’t work with adolescents, or are booked out for months. 

I really want to help foster a healthy way for him to cope with insecurities, as well as realize all the amazing gifts he has. He is 5’6 at 13 and weight is now at 180. He checks the scale daily, even when I have tried to be adamant that he doesn’t obsess over the numbers on the scale.

He is so understanding that Mom is in a bad place financially, and that the pandemic made our situation more dire that before. He expressed today that he doesn’t want me to return the clothes I can for him to get some that fit. And I can respect that. As a woman I have a few totes of “skinny clothes” in my attic- as my weight fluctuates sizes from size 6- size 12 bc of the steroids I’m treated with for some major traumatic MVA injuries. So I “get it”. But not sure how I can make him realize the logic that I need to return the literal wardrobe he has that are NWT to replace them for stuff that fits him well and compliment his body type. 

I know it’s a long spill, but I’m truly desperate for help with handling this. I miss the sparkle in his eyes. Seeing his confident and self love diminish is heartbreaking for me. Any advice guys on how I could go about healing my boy’s negative self image? Any way to help him feel comfortable in his own skin.

I understand that taking him to pick out nice flattering and well fit wardrobe would likely do wonders, and I plan on it next month with hopes his dad pays his child support. Things are desolate financially for me. But I will take him next month when I get a little extra money I hope. Being disabled and in the process of appealing for disability has been a multiple year
Pain in the ass ordeal. But I always find a way.
He is understanding that I have been doing all I can. So besides buying him clothes for his body type, what else can I do to help my baby.

You guys seem to be a supportive sub and I’m hoping you can give me some advice on how YOU guys would want this handled if you were this kind souled 13 year
Old who is going through a rough patch.
He is seriously an amazing kid. He is selfless. He is smart. But his down spirit is ducking his confidence out daily. I really want to help him find his confidence again. Any suggestions and even criticism is welcomed and needed.

I understand that taking him to pick out nice flattering and well fit wardrobe would likely do wonders, and I plan on it next month with hopes his dad pays his child support. Things are desolate financially for me. But I will take him next month when I get a little extra money I hope. Being disabled and in the process of appealing for disability has been a multiple year Pain in the ass ordeal. But I always find a way. He is understanding that I have been doing all I can. So besides buying him clothes for his body type, what else can I do to help my baby.  You guys seem to be a supportive sub and I’m hoping you can give me some advice on how YOU guys would want this handled if you were this kind souled year Old who is going through a rough patch. He is seriously an amazing kid. He is selfless. He is smart. But his down spirit is ducking his confidence out daily. I really want to help him find his confidence again. Any suggestions and even criticism is welcomed and needed.  Thanks for reading my pathetic story. I hope this is the place to find some way to help him find his self love again",78,13,6601,1263,Teenager 13-19 Years
Am I a bad dad for making my daughter walk to school?,"My 8th grade daughter and I are having a contest TBD by the comments/ thumbses from this post.  If she wins, she doesn’t have to walk to school anymore and if I win she will have to walk most of the time. She only goes to school 2 days and the other 3 are video conferences.

Her school is ~1/2 mile from her grandmother’s house.  The vast majority of kids at her school get dropped off and picked up every day; I’m talking like 99% of the kids.  I think a little exercise is good for her.   The clincher is that her backpack is legitimately  25-30 lbs since no lockers due to Covid rules.   She told me that her back and shoulders get sore from carrying all the weight, but I think she’s just a little soft.  She’s athletic but out of shape due to organized sport season cancellations.

Feeling stuck with parenting/disciplining my HFA son,"My son is 14 years old. He is on the autism spectrum. If I were to describe where he’s at, I would consider him higher functioning in the sense that he can bathe himself, make himself basic meals, get dressed, etc. 

My parenting style with him has always been open and loving. I’ve always expressed love and praise toward him. However, the way he acts someone might assume it’s very different. 

He is not affectionate with anyone. He is very abrupt and rude, especially with older family members, such as his aunts, uncles, grandparents and his parents. He acts as though most people inconvenience him. 

I always tell him I love him. He is reluctant to say it back, and if he does, it’s always in a sarcastic, laborious tone. 

He is home schooled, but even getting him to do things for his schooling is also difficult. For instance, a few years ago he decided that he doesn’t want to read books. To him, he wants to get his information solely from the internet. I have told him that if he is to finish high school, he is going to be required to read actual books and to make book reports. When trying to discuss this with him, the waterworks begin and he shuts down. Because of covid, these things seem much worse, as he isn’t able to really socialize much with anyone outside of home. 

He doesn’t want to even see friends in person. 

When trying to get him to help out, it’s like pulling teeth. He does or forces a person to accept the bare minimum or below minimum of effort from him for anything and everything. Many sites I read say that praise works well with autistic children, but he is unresponsive or dismissive. He will say he “hates” everything. There’s nothing outside of video games that makes him happy. 

When I try to discuss these things with him, he shuts down/gets mad. When I try to discipline him, he gets mad. When I try to be open and loving, he shuts me out and doesn’t take me seriously. I am at the end of my rope. 

I am at the point where I am not even sure how to parent him anymore. I feel defeated as a parent. I love him but I am sick of being treated like I don’t matter. I am angry, resentful and upset that I have sacrificed and done so much for him, and he genuinely doesn’t care.   

I know it’s not right to compare, but I even notice children who have had less of a happy or ideal upbringing have more love, compassion and respect toward their mother and families than my son does. They will do things for their families or help out, and my son doesn’t. He doesn’t want to do anything. No matter what I’ve done, he doesn’t give a shit. 

Has anyone else had this issue, or currently experiencing it? What are some things you’ve done to rectify or help? Any advice at this point would be helpful. I’m literally losing sleep over this.",0,"Feeling stuck with parenting/disciplining my HFA son My son is years old. He is on the autism spectrum.

Lessons from helping my not-so-math smart middle schooler,"Bit background: we have two girls. Elder one was exceptionally good in math and very rarely needed help. Younger one struggled from elementary school. We tried enrolling her in many private tutoring and online classes but she was doing rather poorly. She was convinced that she is ‘not smart’ like her sister.
Recently, me dad (background Stem field, with university teaching experience) decided to jump in and was able to help her dramatically. Writing this down, hoping it will help someone.

1. Many teachers teaches kids to apply formulas or methodologies with out ensuring basics are clear. Kids look for certain key words and try apply formulas rather than understanding problem and solving it. In this approach, if a math problem needs a concept from past, kids wont be able to apply it. 

How I tried to fix it:
Try to get all info from problem and and ‘set it up’. Eg if problem states the shape is a cube, possibly sides are equal etc.
Now comeup with a plan to solve it. Write the plan in English. They should be able explain why they are doing it. Do not skimp. Let it take time. Try to be descriptive.
Now try to solve it.

This approach was painfully slow, and will frustrate kids initially. But soon they will see results. 

2. Let them attempt the problems without help. If they give up, give hints. Also explain how you figured out that was the direction. Ask them why they couldnt figure it out. This will expose gaps in knowledge and understanding. Go back to Khan academy or youtube and brush up.

Sometimes they will get a mental block and wont see the obvious. That is ok. If it is something they should know, give them a very subtle hint. Also ask them to think why they didnt see it. After every problem, do a retrospective.


3. Convince them that math is all about practice. There is Nothing called smarts. Take breaks, but keep the focus. It is really a slow grind than a sprint. Share their pain and be patient. 


4. Set a realistic stretch goal( something she think she cannot do.) It will be a huge confidence boost once the child actually reaches it.
In her case, there was a Math Kangaroo test which she failed miserably. My promise was by end of 2months, she will be able to do it all by herself. To my surprise, she was able to do most of it in a month. 

I cant claim that she loves math now. But her paralyzing fear to the subject is definitely gone.

I think my daughter (17) is sneaking out to see people instead of actually going to work.,"My daughter doesn’t have her license yet so I have to drive her around everywhere. Especially to work and back which is like 40min round trip. For the past month I have become suspicious of some of the things that’s been happening. 

She works at a grocery store as a cashier and sometimes I grab a few things things when I drop her off and pick her up. I never see her in there for some reason, I figured maybe she had to talk to her manager or something or on break. Lately, she has been getting out early, like almost an hour before her shift ends. The first few times it didn’t really faze me since sometimes they let her go early but now it’s every single shift. Her excuse is that due to COVID they have been cutting a lot of hours. My suspicions kept arising when she smelled like marijuana one night and she had no explanation for it. Also, she never puts on her work clothes before work anymore. She says she just changes when she goes to work but I see the same clothes on when I pick her up. 

I can be strict but that’s only because I love her and I don’t want anything bad happen to her. There’s no problem with her hanging out with friends as long as I meet the parents first. It’s a different story when it comes to boys and I’m afraid she’s meeting men instead of working. She’s scheduled to get her license in the following weeks and I’m really concerned it’s going to enable her to continue to sneak around.",0,"I think my daughter (17) is sneaking out to see people instead of actually going to work.

"Inspiring letter for kids, good for parents to show your children","“Hi Guys

I wanted to give you a message about why knowledge, and your education, is more valuable long term, than the quick and easy pleasure and satisfaction of video games and movies. I want you to take a moment to think about this.

When you are playing a game or watching a movie, it feels great right? You are relaxed, having a good time, and enjoying the experience. You want to do more of this good stuff, since it makes you happy, who wouldn’t want to do this all day every day right? 

But this pleasure, and this good experience, this only lasts as long as you are doing the activity. Once you stop your game, or stop watching a movie, how many times have you turned your device off and went from being happy and feeling good, to feeling bad? Or even angry and annoyed that you have to go back to the real world? I know I’ve had this many times. That positive experience and happiness disappears, and you have nothing left to show for it. You cant get that happiness back, unless you play the game or watch the movie again. But in life, how often are you going to have time for that? 

You know where long lasting happiness and pleasure come from? Developing a skill, or competence. In our case I’m talking about developing skills in maths. Skills and techniques that you can actually use to solve problems. The pleasure from having a skill doesn’t disappear, because once you learned that skill, it will always stay with you.

And you know whats the best part? You can share skills with others! If you learn how to play guitar, not only are you feeling absolutely fantastic about the beautiful songs you can play, that you learned by yourself, but you can also play those songs for others. Do you know how amazing that feels? I play piano myself, and nobody can take that away from me. It always makes me happy, and even when I’m not playing piano, I can feel happy, knowing that I worked hard to be good at piano and it’s a skill I can be proud of. 

Can you share a movie or a game with others? sure, but then you're all experiencing just another empty moment, and afterward the experience, there is nothing left, nothing impactful, nothing that enriched your lives or relationships and friendships with one another. 

The same goes for your schooling. Once you develop knowledge, you also start to develop pride in yourself and what you know and can do. It feels great to smash your SAC’s. It feels great to get those high marks in exams. And if you’re competitive, it feels great to beat other people in tests at school right? Let that competitiveness motivate you, if not in competition with others, then in competition with yourself, to always be setting new benchmarks of your skills and abilities. Humans have no greater strength than that of their willpower.

Let that competitiveness motivate you, if not in competition with others, then in competition with yourself, to always be setting new benchmarks of your skills and abilities. Humans have no greater strength than that of their willpower.  class comment”",65,11,2797,506,Teenager 13-19 Years
Dating teen,My daughter ask to go on a blind date to a football game. I saw the guy on Instagram he goes to another hs close by. This game is at 8 pm. She comes to me tonight and says 10pm. I told her now only if I go due to the time. I also stressed it’s more dangerous to be out that late. She knows I don’t approve so she stormed out. I don’t want her sneaking out. But she is always asking for things that make me scared for her. Any advice?,0,Dating teen My daughter ask to go on a blind date to a football game.

Oh the joys of parenthood,"Cheers to 45 minute discussions about why PreAP classes are important!!!
According to my 13 year old, no one is going to care that he took PreAP classes in middle school. 
Then he went on about extra essays, reading and math. 
Coming from someone who was reading at 7th grade level in 3rd grade and performed on 6th grade math in the same, I know he’s not overwhelmed with the work. 
He wants to rush through and have the day to himself now that we’re doing virtual.

Today will forever be known as the day Mom lost her shit.,"Let me just start by saying I have great kids. They’re kind, respectful, responsible, good students, etc etc... (and they’re teenagers!). I’m a pretty laid back mom because honestly, whether it’s good parenting or just dumb luck, my kids have always been pretty easy going themselves. But everyone makes mistakes... We moved to this town 2 years ago and it hasn’t been an easy adjustment for my son. He’s well liked and got involved in extra-curricular activities but he still misses his old friends. He still spends his free time playing online games with them. This year has been especially tough, stuck in the house, in a town he doesn’t like, with little to do. He had wanted to get a summer job but that didn’t work out. And his grandparents (my in-laws) have been gravely ill from Covid-19 (getting better though). He’s been very good about helping out around the house and mowing, so I’ve been more lenient than usual about his gaming. Until today. School started remote learning a couple weeks ago here, but his friends have not started school yet. I’ve noticed he’s had trouble getting back on track and it’s because he’s staying up late playing. I gave him some stern warnings, and this morning he was up early and ready to get to work. I was impressed. Until around 9:00 when it became obvious he didn’t wake up early, he had stayed up all night! I was having to keep waking him up in between classes. I was so mad. As soon as class was done I dragged him out to the car to run errands with me. His eyes were bloodshot and he looked miserable. First stop to the county dump to haul trash, and he got to unload it. Back in the car. Every time he started to nod off I sprayed him with my water bottle. I lectured him the whole time about how he not only acted irresponsibly but also forced me to take time away from my own work. Next stop the grocery store. I made him push the cart and put every item in it. Then he got to pay all $94 of it with his debit card. He loaded the groceries in the car. Went home. He carried them all in and put them all away. Next we went to the park for a mile long walk around the lake. In the rain. I had a hoodie on. He didn’t. Got home and he helped me fix dinner. By this point he was about to drop and asked me how much longer he has to stay up. I said at least 8:00. He went to get a shower to help him wake up a bit, then came out, gave me a hug and told me he’d do better from now on. I’m not sure if I handled this the right way or not (this was so unlike me), but I’m proud of my son for his response to it. I think it might have scared him to see his mom go crazy like this.

I'm going to explode I can feel it coming,"I posted a bit ago about my son treating me like his taxi well we got his car situation figured out with help of my money and etc but fine it's figured out. The minute one problem is gone another arises. I have an 18 year old son and a 16 year old daughter, school started Tuesday. The Daughter point blank won't go, she won't get up. There's nothing you can do either as she is an ODD/ADHD kid so she'll push back harder when you try to make her do anything. So that is frustrating but that leads into this.

Myself and my wife are working from home, I've got big time work over the past 2 weeks like a full months income in 2 days type of work. I'm barely sleeping doing all I can to bang out big dollars to put in savings because who knows what will happen. I'm usually the house person cause I've worked from home for years..

I told them how this was and, no one steps up to help. My house turns into a trashpit unless I clean it up after I work for 16 hours. No one wants to cook, my wife is a part time baker as a side job and I usually help her, I can't right now and neither kid will step up to be helpful. They each have 2 chores a day and most of the time they don't get done...I feel like no one can do shit without me wiping their ass for them.

I'm running on little sleep and lots of caffeine and can't get a finger lifted to help me. I can feel the explosion building because all I really want to say is if you guys can't lift a finger for the 2 weeks I have extra work to be helpful around here.

"Advice on raising teenagers, from a teenager","I was having deep thoughts about the relationship between parents and teenagers, and the plethora of friends I have with horribly toxic parents. I want to make sure that nobody has to suffer like they have. So, here are my observations.


1. Mental illness is very real and often times can rapidly get worse. If your child needs help, get them help ASAP.


2. Parents don’t always know best, because they’re not teens and can’t know everything. Teens don’t know best, because we’re fucking idiots. What’s best for us is somewhere in the middle of those two. 



3. We need privacy. If you have a teen, it’s not your job to police their friendships or romance life. But PLEASE teach them that sex is okay as long as it’s safe. In the US where I live, the sex education is truly awful, so it’s on the parents to teach it right.

I am at my wit's end with my 17 year old.," 

# 

Good evening everyone, I am a single father of two boys, 14 and 17 years old. I have concerns regarding both of them but right now I am primarily concerned with the older. I feel bad for saying this about my own son but in the interest of being honest I will say it. He is probably the most deceitful and lazy person I have ever encountered in my life. I did what I thought was best during his upbringing but having an ex-wife that was extremely belligerent towards me and my second wife (during which we/I got sole custody) didn't help. I am now divorced again (which I will leave alone) but now I am at my wit's end. The children's mother can't get her life together (despite thousands of dollars I have spent trying to help her get her shit together) and isn't any real help. I am not trying to frame myself as a perfect parent. I know I have plenty of problems. At this point though I don't know what to do. All he does it sit around and fuck off and eat everything I have in my kitchen. He has zero regard for anyone else and will readily steal food that was meant for other people. I have literally caught him on video doing things and have shown him and he will still deny shit and throw out more lies. Help me out please because I dont want to  just kick him the fuck out when , hopefully, he graduates.",0,"I am at my wit's end with my year old.    #   Good evening everyone, I am a single father of two boys, and years old.

16 Year Old Stepson is Extremely Attached to his Mother,"I have been married to by best friend I have known for 30 years for two months. I took in her 16 year old son as my own and I love him like he is blood. He and his mother have been through a very abusive past and have a strong and beautiful bond. However, he is too close. He does have developmental and emotional issues. Makes sense considering the past.
He and I get along great and I truly love him. I just think something isn't right.
He waits for his mom outside the bathroom. He wakes her up every morning and demands she gets out of bed. I work second shift and don't get home until 2 am most nights and my wife usually waits up for me. It wakes me up a wel and can be frustrating. 
When she is awake he can't be without her. He will come into our room and stand over us and constantly poke her and try to talk.
He does have ambitions in life, but has not much of a drive. When asked to do chores he acts as if he can't do them on his own. 
He is not autistic, but does have manic depression and is on medication. It is well managed. 
It's just something isn't right. He is very normal as far as a 16 year old... He has the attitude, he has smarts, he actually stays away from drugs and alcohol and people that do that mess. He has this extreme attachment that is very much like a toddler. 
We both love him so much but worry about his emotional development. Therapy doesn't go but so far and medications don't either.

My Kid Made An Agreement to Earn a smartphone and...hasn’t. For 4 years.,"My partner (42F) and I (37F) have majority custody of my two stepkids (12F and newly turned 15M).  They are here except every other weekend and a Wednesday dinner, so we are the primary parental figures involved and handle 100% of the school stuff. Note, I don’t go hands on with any of this, so it is her call, but we discuss and she isn’t on Reddit. 

My SS15 has always had issues turning assignments in.  Even if he completes them, they aren’t turned in. He seems to have either a concern about them being ""perfect"" (if they tax his genuinely significant brainpower), or a concern about wasting time (if they don’t).  So he has tons of uncompleted assignments. Then he fails classes and ends up in summer school.  On the years it doesn’t end up with summer school, there is a lot of catchup work, tears, and meltdowns trying to turn a bunch of work in at the last minute with our help, and still lots of ""0"" in the gradebook.  Nobody enjoys any of this...not us, not him. 

He has had behavioral and learning disability evaluations, he has dysgraphia that we work around by allowing him to type or dictate his work, and he has support to get things done (down to one of us sitting with him to mindmap for an essay he is overwhelmed by, being his typist, or generally ANY assistance he requests).  As long as he's trying, and turning in SOMETHING, we are happy. 

At the start of 6th grade, we made him a deal...give us ONE quarter/trimester of every assignment being turned in, and we will get you a smartphone.  They don't have to be on time, they don't have to get passing grades...just turned in. He agreed happily and readily to this plan.

Well - now he's starting 10th grade.  And we have NEVER had a quarter or trimester that met that goal.  Neither of us imagined that when we made this agreement, we would get anywhere NEAR this age without meeting it. Even when he failed English last year, and so had to take summer school which had far fewer assignments...and even when we told him, looking at the grade book, ""hey, if you just turned in in this one missing assignment, you get your smart phone""...he doesn't do it.  Even with COVID last Spring, with standards being WAY reduced and only very few assignments due, with us reminding him of the stakes and offering supports, it didn't get done.

We have been on the receiving end of a few “well everyone ELSE has a PHONE"" comments lately, and I commiserate. It’s a bit odd for a 15 year old not to have one. But we made an agreement that is well within his ability to meet, and no matter what help we offer, he doesn’t. 

What do we do?!? 

NOTES:
-he has a lot of other social interaction opportunities (gaming, discord, etc) via laptop
-he has a flip phone for emergencies 
-he has also had opportunities and earned money enough to buy his own phone, and hasn’t. 
-other than a few minor “everyone else has one” comments, he has acknowledged that he hasn’t done what he needed to do, and hasn’t pushed too hard for another outcome.",0,"My Kid Made An Agreement to Earn a smartphone and...hasn’t.

The boys are now young men and we just had a family game night- heart is so full,"It's not as big of a deal as I'm making it to be. I'm the first to admit that I'm a sentimental sap.

I'm a grateful stepmom to two boys. They were 8 and 12 when they let me into their lives. Honestly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, it was bumpy with the older guy for the first little while. I never tried to be his mom, but it was a little easier to build a relationship with the younger guy. 

Anyways, years have gone by. It's true what they say- kids grow up. The older dude doesn't live at home anymore; his wings have spread and they work. So proud. The younger guy is in his last year of secondary school, and is coming out of a tail-spin that lasted two years. So proud. Things change, and still, I'm so proud.

Tonight was an impromptu throwback to when we did family dinner at the dining room table, except better. My husband and I reached out to the older guy to see if he wanted to come over for dinner. He said yes, so we mentioned to the younger guy that we were having dinner and that it'd be great if he could join us. 

There were no phones at the table, lots of ""thank you for dinners"", the boys cleared the table, we played Catan, and there were no verbal jabs between brothers as there had been when they were younger. Neither kid was squirming, just waiting to get away. 

My peeps, it was a peaceful, easy feeling.",0,"The boys are now young men and we just had a family game night- heart is so full It's not as big of a deal as I'm making it to be.

Teen smacking younger brother?,"When I was younger I was sorta in charge of raising my baby brother. My dad was out at work ( and when not working, not exactly home with us ) and my mom lived with her boyfriend, so when I wasn't at school I was in charge of my baby brother. I look back on it now and feel fucking horrible for it, but i ended up smacking my baby brother on the back of the head a few times. I've even pulled his hair. Never very hard, he would sniffle and maybe even start to cry but when he did I would hug him because I didn't mean to hit him that hard. I never wanted to, but I knew no other way of what to do! The only times I pulled his hair was when he would pull our cats tail, I would do it and say ""You don't like it, right?"" The smacks were very few and would be almost like...the only comparable thing is when someone says something kinda stupid and you hit the back of their head and say ""dumb@ss!"" I would normally do that if I've told him to stop getting into something I knew would hurt him or he wasn't listening to me. Though, and I feel bad saying this, I have done it a few times because he was just being annoying. I was 16 at the time, I should have 100% known not to do this. Afterwords he was never upset (other than the few times I was too harsh, which was met with hugs and even apology sweets or something) he would just go and play and he has never been afraid of me. In fact, he actually would run to me before ever my parents and has called me mama a few times. Am I overthinking what I did? I fell horrible for it, normally I would't hurt a fly! I just got so annoyed because I thought my parents should have been having a bigger part of his life, but I shouldn't have taken it out on my brother. I love him! He's turning fours soon and doesn't seem to remember, he is headstrong and silly and all around energetic and really smart for his age!

Teens and cleaning up after themselves,"Honestly, their cleanliness has always been a huge issue. The simply discard whatever they are done with and leave it where they used it. 

I've always tried to get them to clean up after themselves but they just don't.

Outside of their bedrooms I clean up the house every few days. Because I clean every few days it doesn't get terribly bad. 

Their rooms on the other hand...

I've taken to going in there every other month and literally doing a deep clean myself. 

My youngest doesn't mind so much and he will actually work with me on it. 

The older one gets angry about it because it is an invasion of his privacy. I absolutely get that. I think back to when I was his age and I don't think my room was much better but it was clean enough not to attract pests like ants because I had an incident because I had a habit of eating in bed where I woke up covered in ants. From that moment on I was a cleaner kid...

This has happened to my older son at least a couple of times but still he discards food garbage wantonly wherever - under his bed, to the side, EVERYWHERE. It's GROSS. 

They have been at their mom's this weekend and I have been working on their rooms. The primary intent was to set them up with good learning spaces in their rooms so they can do their school work in a comfortable workspace. The younger one and I were at odds with how I planned to configure his room but I was able to keep it the way he wanted AND do what I wanted so when we were facetiming yesterday and I showed him he was happy and wanted to work with me on finishing it up. 

I started the older one's yesterday. OMFG

I can't even. He just doesn't take a moment to care for his space - NOT ONE MOMENT. So much, so disgusting. 

How can I get through to him? I don't want to punish him, I don't want to fight with him about it I just want him to care more for himself and his space. He's going through stuff, I know there is a component of depression going on. COVID has been hard on him and he and I are at odds often. He is diagnosed oppositional and ADHD and he is in Therapy and honestly we're getting ready to start a more intensive outpatient program to help him and I interact better.

My son (14M) Gets Very Angry with me and His Mother for Moving,"Hey all, so for a bit backstory me, my wife, and my 4 children moved from Ottawa (quite a large city), to a town of just under 5,000 in 2010, my son was 4 when we moved. Since then he has become very interested in computers and electronics. He spends his time configuring servers, finding flaws in programs, coding, and probably a ton more stuff I can’t even imagine. He loves learning more and more about this stuff but I’ve noticed the more he gets into it the less he wants to go out and do anything he isn’t forced to do. I confronted him a while ago and asked why he hasn’t been doing a lot or hanging out with friends. He responded by explaining that he would love to have friends and he would if everyone in our town wasn’t a “greasy redneck”. He explained that whenever he try’s to do anything with kids his age all they do is talk about 4 wheelers, playing hockey, and hunting, all stuff which my son has no interest in. More recently i’ve been finding him a lot more irritable and angry with myself and his mother, I asked what was troubling him and he started yelling about how we’ve totally screwed him over for moving out of the city. He feels that if we still lived in a city there would actually be people he could relate to and be friends with, instead of just talking to people online. What bothers me is that I feel like he’s right. I don’t want to blame myself for moving, I still feel like it was the right move for our family, but I really do feel like i’m limiting his opportunities. What should I do here? I want him to be happy and have opportunities but I don’t know how I can provide that to him.",0,"My son (14M) Gets Very Angry with me and His Mother for Moving Hey all, so for a bit backstory me, my wife, and my children moved from Ottawa (quite a large city), to a town of just under 5,in 2010, my son was when we moved.

Daughter (17) stopped eating a lot because we told her we wanted her to be more in shape,"She is no where fat (5’1 110lbs) and shouldn’t be starting herself over this. Due to the pandemic, we have seen her get more lazy and just stay in her room all day. She used to do the same thing pre pandemic but for the most part she was in school making straight A’s. 

As of now though, it’s usually get up around eight or nine and just sit and bed all day with junk food. I have to remind her every single day to take a walk or eating something healthier. She gets annoyed whenever we try to explain that we want her to make some healthy lifestyle choices. My wife doesn’t want her to end up like her in HS whom was overweight for the most part. One time she ran off for almost two hours crying in the woods after we told her just to exercise and stop sitting in her room all day.   

All she eats now is maybe a meal a day or a small sandwich at lunch time. We’re not trying to be a bad influence or call her fat anything. I think it’s just an overreaction and she needs therapy for it.

Feel like I’ve partially failed,"So, my oldest daughter is 17. A couple years ago she ‘dated’ this boy, her age, for about a year and then they broke up. He proceeded to talk ugly about her, wrote mean things about her in a song, and then hopped from one girl to the next. Basically whoever would give him attention. We live in a small village and his dad is the mayor/correctional officer, so of course his son is spoiled. And by spoiled I mean his parents buy him whatever he wants, even allowed him to put on a ‘rap concert’ for his friends in his backyard with his dad snapping all these pictures and video (which I find completely strange but whatever).

Fast forward to last week, and she’s decided to become his girlfriend again. I told my daughter I don’t agree with this because of how he treated her and seems to treat other girls, but I won’t stop her. Two days ago I was talking to my sister-in-law and venting about how my kid is back with him again, and she said that he will never speak to her daughter again because he sent her dick pics in March. I was floored. So of course I told my daughter that she needed to check into this and sure enough, after talking with her cousin (who received the pictures), and then talking to the boy who admitted he did it, she blocked him on her phone. For a day. Now she’s back to texting him and has decided she wants to be his girlfriend.

I feel like I’ve failed to instill any kind of self-respect. I just cannot fathom why she wants to put herself in the same situation as before with this kid, especially now that we know he sends unsolicited dick pics to his female peers. And I have a funny feeling that wasn’t the first and only time he did it. But he’s preached to her that he’s ‘changed’. Part of me says she has to learn the hard way, but I’m really scratching my head wondering where I went wrong.",0,"Feel like I’ve partially failed So, my oldest daughter is 17.

Her biological mother lives in another state and barely sees her, so me and her dad take care of her but since I am a stay at home mom I look after her more often. So a couple months prior to the virus hit my husband caught her sneaking a boy in, when he told me I asked her “did you have a night visitor?” And she answered honestly “yes” since this was the first time it had happened I was a little tickled about the situation but felt extremely upset at the same time (idk my feelings are weird) so me and my husband took her phone away for a month, he nailed her windows shut and she couldn’t go anywhere for a while. Her punishment was cut short because she was doing such a good job, she was keeping up with her studies and her chores. She promised us it wouldn’t happen again. I believed her. About a week ago I felt this weird feeling that she brought in the same boy again, idk what it was and I asked her and she chuckled and said “oh no, I don’t want my privileges taken away again” again, I believed her. She wouldn’t do this to us. So yesterday we went swimming and she asked me to put sunscreen on her, I caught a glimpse at a bruise she had on her chest area and I asked her about it, she said she hit herself and it left a mark. I didn’t believe her. So when me and her got in the water I confronted her again without her father around, because with me she seems to be more honest. She told me, the middle child told me that she saw him but wasn’t too sure because she was half asleep. And my gut feeling was right, she had brought a boy in again, the same boy.. my heart sank.

I told her I wasn’t going to tell her dad but she needed to give me her phone by 9pm, she agreed but something in me still didn’t feel right, I wasn’t sure what it was so I told my husband about the situation but I asked him not to confront her please. I thought that my awful feeling was about me not telling my husband but after I told him I still felt really sad.

The weirdness of other parents,"My 13y/o daughter and her friend Jill (she turns 13 in November) have been riding their bikes around town since April. I’m grateful we live in an area with parks and sidewalks. They stay on the main roads and there are always people at the parks. Yes, they social distance. 

Jill’s father said they can’t do that anymore because he’s afraid Jill will get abducted and I wouldn’t understand his concern because he has only one child. Guess I have a few spare children  so I don’t care what happens to my kids???

The new rules: If they want to hang out at the park, myself or Jill’s mom need to stay at the park while they’re there. I did this twice and I think it’s crazy. Jill is the  nicest of my daughter’s  friends so I feel like I need to do this otherwise they’re stuck at my house or her house looking at their phones.  Jill is also the only friend my daughter has spent time with due to covid. 

Jill’s mom is a teacher and works long hours. The dad is a SAHD that sometimes plays gigs at bars. Jill told me her dad makes rules and expects others to follow them but not him. He won’t be taking the girl’s to the park to supervise them.

I did this twice and I think it’s crazy. Jill is the  nicest of my daughter’s  friends so I feel like I need to do this otherwise they’re stuck at my house or her house looking at their phones.  Jill is also the only friend my daughter has spent time with due to covid.   Jill’s mom is a teacher and works long hours. The dad is a SAHD that sometimes plays gigs at bars. Jill told me her dad makes rules and expects others to follow them but not him. He won’t be taking the girl’s to the park to supervise them.    This is just a vent.

"My 14 year old niece is out of control. Constantly talks about sex, boys, etc.","I don't even know where to begin. I am putting this on my main account rather than an alt because at this point, I just don't even care about my identity or judgment. I don't care if my friends/family read this. Hell maybe they need to.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband's niece is 14. I've been with him since she was 4, so have known her for 10 years. We haven't been around her a whole lot honestly. She's bounced from house to house (her paternal grandmother, her maternal grandmother, her moms &amp; stepdads, her dads and stepmoms. It's just a huge mess. Her maternal grandmother had more respect from me than my own mother. I loved her so much. She was very dear. Before she passed away 2 years ago, I'd talk about my niece with her. You see her parents are huge, *huge* screw ups. They have been on meth, in and out of jail, etc. She's had little to no stability. She did live with her maternal grandmother for a period of time and was doing very well. Good grades, was engaging, etc. Once her mother met a guy, ugh...I'm sorry to say who was released from jail after a number of years, they moved away. It's been a catastrophe ever since. Anyway, sorry for the scatterbrainedness. I promised my MIL that I would do everything I could to protect my niece. She wanted to make sure she wasn't pregnant by 14, end up in jail, on drugs, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week she stayed with us. The way she talks is just sickening. She's not mean, well...she doesn't *try* to be mean. She did say to me, ""You're uncultured swine."", after I told her I didn't know who someone she was talking about was. I told her that was unacceptable and to never speak to me like that again or I would take her phone away from her. She has had her nose in that phone since she's been here. She literally only puts it down when she's sleeping. A few minutes ago someone sent her a picture and she said to me, ""Look!"" So, I looked and there was a penis on her phone. I told her to give me her phone. She was on snapchat. I messaged the guy/kid/whatever that he better never send that shit to her again. And that I would do him and tell his parents. He said, ""She's in sex chat group.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course she doesn't live with us. So, do I even have a say so? Idk what to do guys. This isn't the first insanely sexual thing that she's done. Apparently she sent nudes to a 30 year old. She said she never did that. Her stepmother lies about things and is very manipulative. My niece lies about dumb things. Her dad is a compulsive liar. Her step mom said, ""Idk what to do anymore."" I encouraged her repeatedly to go to family therapy and all I got for a response is excuses as to why they *couldn't*do it. What do I do??

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: 14 year old niece is engaging in questionable behavior online. I'm only her aunt. No one seems to care what she does. I don't know what to do, or *if* I can do anything.

Question about sexual expression of children over the age of consent.,"
So I have twins, a boy and a girl, and they’re 16. This morning, my daughter asked me bluntly “So I was wondering if I can get a vibrator.” I said I’ll think about it and here I am, on Reddit. As you can tell, she’s shameless about her sexuality. I’m generally pretty progressive about this stuff and I don’t really care how she expresses herself or if she has safe sex (age of consent is 16 here). In other words, as long as she buys it with her own money, she can get a vibrator. I’m just not sure I want to set this precedent, as if my son finds out then he may want something. And generally, my daughter may begin buying more of this kind of stuff and I don’t want my house to start looking like a sex shop. I feel like it’s almost unfair to my son because he deserves to express his sexuality with a toy if he so pleases, and I don’t want to come across as giving my daughter privileges. How can I go about having a sex-positive conversation about sex toys so both my kids can get them and they won’t become serial buyers?",0,"Question about sexual expression of children over the age of consent.

"(Guardian, not parent) Parents of teens who are mentally ill, how do you cope?","Hi, heres a little backstory so this makes sense (tw: vague mention of child abuse):

Im 18, almost 19, and I take care of my younger sister (13) since we both experienced childhood abuse by our parents. We finally left after I barely turned 18. Yesterday, my sister started explaining to me how she felt, her worsening anxiety issues, ect. She’s clearly super traumatized by the situations we’ve experienced, and I feel like I’m a failure of a parental figure for it. Even though I wasn’t her guardian back then, I was still her only “protector”. I failed to protect her from the mental abuse and now she’s mentally ill because of it. 

So, now to my question: parents/other guardians, how do you deal with feeling at fault for your child’s mental illness? And how do you help them beyond getting them treatment?

(Also, we are already having professional help with our mental issues. She has already getting help for a year or so (for her anxiety disorder, not her trauma related issues), but I’m now in contact with her psychiatrist to make sure she can get a better, more effective treatment for both anxiety and trauma related issues.)

Lastly, I apologize if this question doesn’t exactly fit in this sub since I’m not her mother and am just her older sister who is her guardian (along with a grandmother who provides financial support). I am trying my best to be as mature as I can in my situation and would really appreciate the advice anyone can give.",0,"(Guardian, not parent) Parents of teens who are mentally ill, how do you cope?

Stuck with it and now my son will have the gift he wants for his 18th birthday!,"My son is 17, has Autism, ADHD, significant anxiety, and occasional depression. He has come a LONG way this year and even rocked the end of school last year despite the massive issues that came with unexpected remote learning. He’s still in school for a few more years and is holding steady, but maturing so much socially and individually. 
His birthday is soon and he mentioned earlier this year wanting a laptop and drawing tablet to continue some of his comics and animations. After discussing it with my husband and my ex (my kids’ dad), I immediately started saving a little each week. 
Well, this week rolled around and my ex had found an awesome deal on a 2-in-1 laptop that doubles as a tablet and includes a digital pen! It was slightly more than I had saved and my husband told me to take the remainder from our shared household savings account to cover it. My ex also offered to reimburse a portion in the coming weeks, which is wonderful!  So, my son is getting exactly what he wanted for his birthday this year! My dad has already bought some flash drives so that my son can organize his content (and not clutter the laptop), I have plans to finish the final decorations in my son’s revamped room, and my husband is encouraging his creativity with some small collectibles from one of my son’s favorite series.

Anyone else have a teen struggling to find a job bc of nervousness and social anxieties?,"My teen (senior in high school) is looking for PT work while doing online school. She is a nervous, anxious, probably on the spectrum type of amazing girl, but having a really tough time landing a job. I feel like no one can get past her awkward fumbling of words, sentences that don’t make sense, nervousness enough to see she’s a 4.0 student who wants to be a Vet. Dedicates her life to arts and animals. The most kind and empathetic young lady you could meet, but when the camera is on - yup, zoom interviews - she freezes up and can’t speak. She’s pretty nervous in person too until she warms up to people or the situation. I just don’t know how to help her here. I feel like there are organizations that help kids who struggle, but I hate to say, I would never want to offend, no one considers her to be on the spectrum struggling, so what kind of help am I asking for? In her high school for example, there is a work program that is for students with disabilities only. Honestly, sounds like the best program that they should offer to students who feel they could use the help but my daughter doesn’t qualify, yet in my mind I do feel like she could use all the assistance they offer with the amazing tools and guidance and internships. We don’t live in a place where you can easily get an internship or get handed a “family friend, mom and pop” kinda job. To work at Chipotle you’re one of a dozen kids who has to apply and interview to beat out for the job.  I’m just looking for some thoughts, guidance or advice here. I’ve tried teachers but now with inline schooling, they are very disconnected. Do we go door knocking to places and see who’s hiring instead of doing online interview?

Niece hates us. All we tried to do was help her.,"Today is my nieces 13th birthday. 
Facebook memories just showed me the pictures of us celebrating last year.

This year I doubt she will even to see us. 

She was in our custody for 2 years while her mom was in jail. We did so much for her. She’s never had a stable home, so we tried to give her that. We were very open and upfront with her. At first she had a lot of freedom, but then she started betraying our trust. We would tell her “if you do X for Y amount of time you will get Z privilege back, we just need to see you try” 

Instead she just found new ways to get around X. So we had to add more restrictions. Try new punishments/reward systems. She was in group counseling through the school and we tried to get her into more therapy, but we are low income with 0 assistance for her. So we couldn’t afford most places, and anywhere that offered free help had a ridiculous waiting list or wouldn’t take her before age 13. We were again upfront with her about it and told her we were doing what we could and tried to find alternative help for her and get her around adults she felt comfortable talking to (example: my best friend would take her for ice cream and niece would talk her head off)

We tried so hard to be there for her and help her avoid the path her mother took. But she idolized her mother. Nothing we did would make her see that the way her mom lives isn’t okay, and just because you grew up in that type of environment doesn’t mean it has to define you. But she’s convinced that she has to go down the same path as her mom. 

Well, moms out of jail now. Niece wants nothing to do with us. She has talked openly about how she hates us for being “rich and white” which is laughable because A. She’s white. B. We are nowhere near rich, but both work, own our home, and have enough to sometimes eat out and see a movie. 

She openly defends gang life style, brags about how she isn’t scared of the “ghetto” areas in our city and we don’t know what we are talking about when we say it’s not safe. DHs a corrections officer and wouldn’t let her visit areas where he knows for a fact criminals straight out of jail live. 

SIL and my MIL let her do whatever the hell she wants. They let her go see whoever unsupervised and then complain when she comes home covered in hickeys. Even her cousin, who was her best friend, says she doesn’t want to be around her due to her behavior and the company she keeps. 

We tried so hard for 2 years, but it wasn’t enough to undo years of damage. We have our own three year old son and now a second child who will be here any day now. I hate that we’ve given up on helping her, but I can’t do it anymore. I miss her and want her well, but we never had the resources to give her all the help she needed. Instead we just turned ourselves into the bad guys who will never understand her.

Sorry for the long post, but I’m just pregnant and emotional at the moment.

DHs a corrections officer and wouldn’t let her visit areas where he knows for a fact criminals straight out of jail live.   SIL and my MIL let her do whatever the hell she wants. They let her go see whoever unsupervised and then complain when she comes home covered in hickeys. Even her cousin, who was her best friend, says she doesn’t want to be around her due to her behavior and the company she keeps.   We tried so hard for years, but it wasn’t enough to undo years of damage. We have our own three year old son and now a second child who will be here any day now. I hate that we’ve given up on helping her, but I can’t do it anymore. I miss her and want her well, but we never had the resources to give her all the help she needed. Instead we just turned ourselves into the bad guys who will never understand her.  Sorry for the long post, but I’m just pregnant and emotional at the moment. Feeling a mix of sadness, guilt, some relief that I now only have to focus on my family, and guilt for feeling relieved.",48,11,3036,595,Teenager 13-19 Years
Whatever happened to respect for your elders? I'm so upset I'm crying,"This isn't about my own kids, but actually about my nephew, so I know it isn't necessarily related to MY parenting but I feel there was definitely some failed parenting here somewhere....A little background...My nephew is 15 and constantly on FB. His family are very much avid Trump supporters. His mom's political beliefs have rubbed off on him and he is constantly posting political memes and sometimes really offensive stuff. I usually just ignore it. I don't care if you are a TRUMP supporter or not. It's not about the politics but there was a big argument today when he posted something about racism saying something to the affect of there would be no racism if we all just quit talking about it. His aunt, who is half black, posted a comment saying ""Or people could just not be racist"". After that she started getting very negative comments from people. I made a comment taking up for her. I then was off FB for awhile but when I logged back on my nephew had made some new post about someone starting shit on his FB page and then reporting him because apparently the post or some of the comments were no longer there. People then started commenting asking what BITCH had reported him and he says my name. I was floored because I in NO WAY reported him for his post. I had no clue what he was talking about. I also couldn't believe he would let some random person call his aunt a bitch. I posted that he had the wrong person and i would never report someone for something on fb and that him calling me out like that on fb was rude as hell because you don't do that if you don't have evidence anyway. It turned into a shit show and my own nephew called me ""stupid AF"" and in the end I was just so shocked at the way he was talking to me and everything that I blocked my own nephew on fb. My four kids would never talk to me that way and have never talked to any of their aunts or uncles with anything but the utmost respect. I know I shouldn't have even engaged and argued with a 15 year old but it hasn't been the best of days either (my dad just had to have 3 stents put in today and i couldn't be at hospital with him due to COVID, plus my mom broke both her legs and i had to go give her a bath). 

Are kids really like this these days? Am I the only one that still believes that there should still be a level of respect there? I've never been nothing but good to my nephew so I just don't get it. Anyway, I'm so upset I just needed somewhere to vent. Thanks to anyone that reads this all the way.

17 year old son girlfriend 16 hours away,"My son is 17 and a junior in high school. I will start by saying he's a little behind emotionally. Really he is more like a freshman maturity-wise. Anyway, he has been video chatting with a girl who he says is his girlfriend. Problem is she lives 15 hours away.

I tried to tell him that a relationship of that distance is going to cause them a lot of pain and probably won't work out in the end but of course they don't listen.

I am really worried about his plan due to his maturity level and I just feel like it would be throwing away the opportunity to stay home and save up money to get a good start on his future like we had planned.

Taking in my niece. Need advice,"As the title says I am taking in my niece on Friday. She is the victim of sexual assault. How do I go about getting her signed up for school and for guardianship?


Also how do I go about talking with her on what happened? Do I just leave it alone or do I dive in head-on and let her do most of the talking?


Backstory:
She is 15 and her current guardian found video of her and a 25yo grown ass man on her phone having sex. The police were contacted and the guy and his mother were both arrested (mom was arrested because she knew and warned him not to get caught, but still allowed it to happen.) he got bailed out and contacted her little sister and made threats towards her life. That is why she's moving here because my spouse and I live 3hrs away and no one from her hometown know where we live. So we are taking her in to protect her. Both of her parents are not in the picture so we are her last resort for some kinda safety from this person.

At my wit's end with my troubled teenager.,"My daughter (14) is pushing all of my buttons, and then some. I had to give her a pregnancy test yesterday (Negative).

She is mean, to everyone in the house. 
She is manipulative.
She lies constantly.
She is selfish.
She is lazy.

She forces her little brother (10) to hang out with her almost 24/7 so she's not alone. She will be mean to him and pick on him. He won't want to be around her but then she guilt trips him into it anyways. He has confided in me that sometimes he wishes she wasn't here. 
She lost the privilege of having a cell phone after I caught her having Snapchat (against my rules) and having over 1000 men she didn't know on there. She got caught recently having a secret cell phone, with Snapchat on it. She's been sending shower videos ECT out to people. She's been sneaking out at night. She's been vaping and smoking weed. Having unprotected sex. Cutting herself. 
This is not healthy for anyone in the house. She is affecting all of us. I've taken her to the hospital multiple times. She's in therapy. She's on meds. I reach out for all the help I can get. I ask for any resources and help and she either isn't qualified or we don't have the money.

Are we doing it wrong? (Questioning consequences - looking for feedback),"I'll try to keep this short...

Sound familiar? What can I do?,"Alrighty folks I’m a father of 2 boys who live with their mom. Although I’ve been involved in their lives since day 1. Alexander is 17. Isaiah is 15. Mom has 1 younger daughter from another relationship. And 2 more daughters from her current marriage. 
She has had a rough time with Isaiah for the last 2 years but she fights with me refusing to allow him to live with me. So we’ve managed to maintain a decent co parenting relationship where we usually support each other’s disciplinary measures.  
And Alexander hasn’t given us any problems. Hardly any issues with the exception of the occasional attitude from Alexander. 

That’s the quick backstory for my current dilemma. 

Ok.. so Alexander going into his senior year, has a girlfriend named Marie. She’s 19 but they’ve been dating for almost 3 years now. She’s a very good influence and helps to keep Alexander focused on his academics as well as provides most of the transportation he requires for school or work related activities. She also has been helping their mom with their little sisters quite a bit lately.
However, Isaiah is very rude to her and often speaks to her with a distasteful attitude. It wasn’t always that way with him. But recently he has told me that he resents her because she’s always there. I’ve tried to keep the peace between the brothers. But I’m afraid i let it get too far. You see, Alexander really tries to defend his girlfriend but always being careful not to pick a fight with his little brother. That particular boundary seems to give Isaiah a sense of power where he openly disrespects and blatantly tells her that she’s not welcomed at their house. He’s really causing a problem in their household. In their relationships. And I’ve never condoned his rude comments or poor treatment of marie. In fact, I’ve always taught my sons to treat women with respect no matter what. I think what’s going on (in a nutshell) is that he has lost nearly all respect for his mom. And he cannot respect any other woman if he can’t respect his own mom. Am I right about that?

My Ex-Fiancé and Son are Competing in the Same Tournament.,"About 7 years ago I was left at the altar so to speak. A week before the wedding. It was really traumatic. I left with little (refusing against my lawyers advice to fight). I was a legal assistant for years. The emotional pain of fighting a legal battle, and I did the math. It wasn’t his dad. It was a newly bought house with zero equity. The value of our assets versus the debt. He original offer sucked. But I looked at lawyers fees to make it equitable. And it was going to be like paying my old boss 5-10k for another 5-10k. Plus the emotional anguish.

I don’t regret settling. 

But over time he developed the same same hobby as my ex (billiards) It makes sense. It was the hobby that got us together in the first place. Something I loved. He became good. Like really good. Over the years he’s grown. He’s own 14. But he’s the under 18 champ in the province. He plays adult tournaments. Competes in other countries. 

A couple years ago he signed up up for an adult tournament. A week later I found out my ex did as well. My son is was 12. Itching to play and “destroy” him. I said it was a bad idea. That he’s playing to avenge my honour or some shit. In my head I was thinking that if he lost it would be emotionally painful. He was too young to fight his mothers emotional battles. And yes. Part of me didn’t want to see him. 

Back then I messaged him. I asked him to politely rescind his sign up. He did. But I also asked the league commissioner to ask him to leave. She didn’t need to because he withdrew. He actually did withdraw when I asked. 

And he wished my kid the best. And that was it. He stayed away from tournaments in my city for a couple years. Also my son won the tournament. And many more after. 

Now now it’s happened again. Except my son is exceptionally good  maybe a little rusty with covid. They are both on the list to play the tournament. They are both at the same playing field. Maybe my son is actually better now. 

But...I think my son is still hateful and upset. He holds so much anger that he doesn’t even understand. He sees this as almost David vs. Goliath. He might not even play him. But if he does. If he wins. It will be great. If he loses it will be terrible for his soul. His memory. I know part of it is avenging all the horrible things he remembers that happens. To him it’s killing the demon that destroyed his mother. 

He is not responsible for the choices I made or he made. This isn’t is fight. He’s determined to make it. He’s been itching to play him since he got good at it. I know this. 

I don’t know if I should let this go. I am passed the point of not letting him play. He funds his own tournaments. I know I still have pull with the league commissioner. I just don’t know if it’s right. 

I guess. I’m sorry for the wall of text. I don’t know how to deal with the defeat if he loses. Especially against my ex. I also don’t know how to deal with the win. None of this is his fight. But I think even though he was young. He sees this as though he it’s against him too. Which will kill him too if he loses.",0,"My Ex-Fiancé and Son are Competing in the Same Tournament. About years ago I was left at the altar so to speak. A week before the wedding. It was really traumatic. I left with little (refusing against my lawyers advice to fight). I was a legal assistant for years. The emotional pain of fighting a legal battle, and I did the math. It wasn’t his dad. It was a newly bought house with zero equity. The value of our assets versus the debt. He original offer sucked. But I looked at lawyers fees to make it equitable. And it was going to be like paying my old boss 5-10k for another 5-10k. Plus the emotional anguish.  I don’t regret settling.   But over time he developed the same same hobby as my ex (billiards) It makes sense. It was the hobby that got us together in the first place. Something I loved. He became good. Like really good. Over the years he’s grown. He’s own 14. But he’s the under champ in the province. He plays adult tournaments. Competes in other countries.   A couple years ago he signed up up for an adult tournament. A week later I found out my ex did as well. My son is was 12. Itching to play and “destroy” him. I said it was a bad idea. That he’s playing to avenge my honour or some shit. In my head I was thinking that if he lost it would be emotionally painful. He was too young to fight his mothers emotional battles. And yes. Part of me didn’t want to see him.   Back then I messaged him. I asked him to politely rescind his sign up. He did. But I also asked the league commissioner to ask him to leave.

I wanted to thank you all for your contributions. But I had forgotten to add some more details I thought could help contribute to better advice. These are mostly things my son (m17) has noticed with her, and the following comes directly from him:
~~~~~~
She’s setting standards for herself that she can’t achieve with her current work ethic. 

Again, its like she wants greatness, but without the work that needs to be put in along the way. 

Also, her ego and stubbornness has prevented her from understanding the repercussions of what she is doing. She refuses any help that comes her way, and would rather struggle and eventually give up on her work herself than accept help.
From my time in high school, helping my sister and having taken some of the classes she is in (all of which are wonderful teachers who would stop the class to help her out), my sister is someone who, once she has the help she needs, does not pay attention to anything that her teacher is saying. Even after stopping to repeat or explain topics differently, she feels patronized, and that me or my mom are making her feel “stupid”, and she eventually walks out of the room and continues to do everything herself. 

Sometimes, when she doesn’t understand something, or when she gets frustrated, she won’t ask us questions, just feign understanding so we leave her room. 

I believe that her phone is the problem.  As someone who was (and still is) addicted to their phone, it definitely has an impact on schoolwork. She IS addicted, as she inflicted violence on my mother after her phone was taken away recently, and made a numerous amount of threats. I have noticed my sister skipping classes to go on her phone. This was something my mother failed to mention in the original post. 

Honestly, my Mom is falling into a depressed state, with everything so far having failed to impact my sisters grades. She is a lot more stressed out, and is putting all of her focus into my sister, leaving me to help my youngest brother (9m).

How to give feedback a teenage boy will listen to?,"Not strictly parenting, but my brother is 11 years younger than me (he’s 14, I’m 25), and I voluntarily moved in with my family a year ago to help raise my brother so that I can help him avoid some of the pitfalls I experienced growing up: inattention, inability to handle delayed gratification, etc. I wanted to guide him towards a life of learning and empathy.

So far, it’s been a lot harder than I expected. Specifically, any time I give him feedback, he says he feels like I’m invalidating his whole being.

My parents and I all spend a significant amount of time doing things for him daily, and we rarely say no to his requests for help. Meanwhile, he almost never does anything for us. (Is it unfair to expect him to?) Lately, he likes to lock himself in his room all day and yell at us if we try to check on him.

Today, my mom asked him to help her on a major career-related project she has coming up. It’s a significant time commitment, so he responds with a slew of arguments about how busy he is and how she should do it on her own. I tell him he is selfish because he never wants to help others, and he says that just giving his point of view isn’t selfishness. I tell him he’s always defensive whenever I point out his faults.

Later, he accuses me of always making claims about him that are untrue, such as selfishness and defensiveness. But to me, he has shown a long history of both of these behaviors, always beginning sentences with “I” and always responding to criticism with “no, I’m not.” 

Additionally, he only does things that he set out to do, and nothing else. I gave him a book two months ago, and he still hasn’t finished it. I asked him to just try spending a single day without screen time, a month ago. In both cases, he made repeated promises to do it, and said that we didn’t need to keep reminding him, yet two months later, he still hasn’t done them.

I’m pretty sure a lot of this is because I don’t actually know how to communicate effectively with him. Is there anything I can do to either get better in general, or deliver the above kinds of criticism to him more effectively?",0,"How to give feedback a teenage boy will listen to?

How do I help my daughter (15f) with her grades?,"Im a 40 year old mom using my son’s Reddit account

My daughter (15f) has been flunking the school year already, starting it off with a few Fs. She’s had problems with school and her grades before, but whenever I confronted her, she would explode at me and get violent. Last year, I attributed her low grades to burnout and tough classes. However, this year she has all regular classes, and already failing them a few weeks into sophomore year. The thing is, she is failing the classes because she is not turning in any work for them. 

I already have a few ideas as to why she isn’t even trying to do work anymore. She spends loads of time on her phone, texting people. But whenever I ask her about who she’s texting, she yells at me. Her phone seems like it’s getting in the way of schoolwork. 

In the past, she’s had an excellent work ethic, but now, she has no motivation whatsoever. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it so many times, but she blames it on stuff like her school laptop not working (my son(17m) has volunteered my help to her many times to fix these problems, but she yells at him to get out of her room), or her not understanding stuff (Whenever she says this, I always volunteer to help her, but she gets even more angry with me and says just to leave her alone). Personally, her behavior has gotten me to believe she is hiding something from me.

She does have depression, for which she is being medicated, and she has gotten better with aspects of her life.

Help with online control,"So my daughter (f/14) received some blackmail chat stuff on Instagram basically saying that she has to send titty pics or he will photoshop her face onto porn and post it on the net.

I immediately told her that she was to delete her accounts on Instagram, Snapchat and facebook as they all had her names visible.

Of course, she is pissed, but I am afraid. These threats could be some idiot trying to find easy prey or it could be someone very dangerous.

I understand the insatiable desire to be connected for teens but as a parent, I think I have an obligation and moral duty to make sure that she doesn't get into a situation she can't handle and could be very dangerous.

Can anyone help me with a tempered reaction to this?  I don't know where to draw the line to give her the autonomy she needs and still be a parent and keep her safe.

A lot of times I just sit there in the middle saying nothing because  I have no desire to participate. This has been ongoing for awhile..Now to add where my issues truly come.

He has no broken 3 cars in less than a year, it's always magically ""not his fault"" yea you didn't blow that transmission or burn that clutch, it just happened uh huh. But anyway because of this he just expects me or his mom mainly me, to take him to his job, to football, go get him. It gets worse because he signed up for this CTC program through school that isn't at the school. It's a good 25 minutes from my house..school starts on September 8th he has no car...

He has money and anytime me or his mom tell him to get a reliable car, he argues and throws a damn fit about how they look or what he wants or its his money etc. I've told him repeatedly I'm tired of being his chouffer to every place he needs to go. I'm not going to wake up at 6AM to take him to his program, then pick him up and take him to school then go back and get him 5 days a week. What's happening now is already seriously affecting my ability to make money...I work for myself and all my time is devoted to him and it's frustrating.

This is met with ""you won't have to I'll just quit the program"" he says that because he doesn't think we'd actually let him do that or he'll be passive aggressive for 6 months telling us we ruined his future. And to top all of this off, as the amount he is asking from me has quadrupled the amount he does for me or his mom has declined, he asks more and does less and acts like asking him to do something simple is the end of the world.

He's our 3rd of 4, he asks more of me than any of the other 3 have combined while giving me nothing back. I feel like I dunno what to do but I can't continue to do this, I feel like my life revolves around his while all I get back is attitude.

Am I wrong for feeling this way?",0,"I need some teenager advice. So my son is he'll be soon and he's preparing to start his senior year of high school.

How can I stop my 17yo daughter from smoking weed?,"I found out a few months ago that she was smoking it by her the smell of her clothes. Turns out she’s been doing it occasionally since Christmas. She admitted to driving home high several times which I was completely shocked that she hasn’t gotten into an accident yet.  I had a very long discussions about the dangers and how it wasn’t  really safe for somebody her age to be smoking it. She doesn’t have any mental health issues or anything like that she just does it for fun. I told her if I ever found out she was doing it again, I would come down hard on her. Many of my family members and I myself have experimented at some point with it so I wasn’t going to punish her for the first offense since I tried it at her age too. 

However, I found out she did it again by a vaporizer she left in the car that she must’ve forgot. She went all out with all sorts of sprays that covered up the smells, eye drops, sploofs, and even detoxing drinks if she was ever drug tested. Apparently she would just smoke it at her friend’s (19) house and leave her stuff there.  I banned electronics and took away her privileges until further notice. I do not want her ending up the wrong path and trying  more harder drugs and have something happen. 

School is just a few weeks away and I’m afraid she will just ask one of her friends for some bud.",0,"How can I stop my 17yo daughter from smoking weed?

Need help regarding my brother,"Hi guys
I just found this sub and am in need for help. My brother is 17, refused going to college a year ago and just moved out of my mothers place while working like 3 small shifts a week at mcdonalds. He‘s lazy, doesnt want to study or really work much. My mother pays for everything for him. His rent, his phone bills, clothes, public transport etc. (more than 1000$ a month) while he doesnt do a thing. He tells her that he will just get a few random jobs and will pay everything for himself one day but he never follows through and is just lazy and manipulates my poor mother. I told my mother to stop giving him money so he‘s forced to do something but my mother keeps on giving him and I can see that he totally just manipulates and uses her! He only wants to see her when he needs new stuff for his apartment.. i mean??? 
I personally also find it unfair as I have worked hard and never really relied on my mother.

She’s insisting she needs it now and if I don’t take her to get it done professionally she will do it herself! What is the fascination with piercings and why does she think she needs it now?

My teenage daughter can't swim,"I have three kids, all of which who have been in swimming lessons since they could walk. Where we live there's tons of water around and obviously, it's a necessary skill.

All my kids progressed wonderfully but when my daughter was seven years old, already a competent swimmer at the time, she was swimming into the deepest part of the lake when another swimmer, a twelve-year-old boy who was just learning how to swim for the first time, started drowning in the middle of the lake. In panic he grabbed onto her and she was shoved in. Both kids started drowning, way out in the lake. The boy had had a life belt on but I think in his panic he took it off so he could hold onto it and float but it popped out of his hands and floated away. 

I wasn't there at the time and the shorter part of the lake was only about a hundred feet across so she swam across a lot. They were alone in the lake and they were both falling underwater. The boy's dad noticed first that he couldn't see his kid, at this point they had already been struggling for a few minutes. He dove in and he went looking for them, he managed to grab them both and he took them to shore. Both had to be resuscitated. '

Ever since then, my daughter refused to touch water. There was a time where she'd have panic attacks in the shower and bath and even washing her hair. We took her to therapy and she improved to the point where she was able to bathe comfortably again but she was still absolutely terrified of the water. She's been to a collection of different therapists but she still has a severe fear of water and refuses to go anywhere near it. 

She recently just turned sixteen and finally was coaxed into her grandfather's backyard pool a few months ago. She stayed in the shallow end and tried to swim but she's lost the ability and wasn't able to even float. The therapist had been making a little headway in getting her back into the water but now she says if she can't swim, there's no point in ever going back to the water. Somehow, even though the fear was subsiding, it's come back a lot harder and now she's back to never touching the water.

I'm really out of options here. We've tried therapy, counselling, gradually easing her into water but none of it works. Last year we had to cancel our Disney cruise because she vehemently refused to go on a ship in the middle of the ocean. She said we were free to go ourselves but of course I'm not going to leave her on her own while the rest of the family has fun.

I just don't think it's safe, especially considering we live around so much water.

6 Days Until the Drop Off,"This is probably the only place I can write this where my hubby won’t find it and make fun of me.

Thank goodness it’s also allergy season so my family thinks my random watery eyes and sniffling are from pollen! Since he turned 18 I have been secretly panicking that I haven’t taught him enough, prepared him enough, worrying he hasn’t learned all the life skills he needs to survive. 
Boy did those 18 years fly by. Is it crazy that I already miss my first born and he hasn’t even left yet? It seems like only yesterday he was uttering his first words, I was teaching how to hold pencil, when I could still carry him around, his first day of school, witness the joy of his first hockey shut out where all his little tykes team mates were jumping on top of him. Then there are the “lasts”...his very last hockey game, his premature last day of high school. And some the lasts that I didn’t realize were “lasts” like the last time I took him out for Halloween, or read him a bedtime story, or drive him to his hockey practice or even help him with his homework.

Possible ADHD,"I never really gave a lot of thought if my child had it since we already screened her for ADHD as a really young child. She always has been seen as chatty or a little emotional but I thought it was her being a typical girl. 

Now in freshmen year, some of the teachers have commented that she might have it. At first I was in denial and said she was just beginning Highschool and it would take time to adjust. Her grades would always be stellar with straight A’s and always good compliments about her so it didn’t really occur to me.

There were instances as she was growing up when I have to constantly remind her to do something and then she would forget or I needed to remind her to use her ears and listen. Her relationships with friends were always been poor and can never keep a steady one. Most the time, she would ether be really chatty or super shy around people and was sensitive about things and would cry over the smallest things that she took into offense. 

The dealbreaker was when I was teaching her how to drive and she could never focus on the road but be dazed off and forget all the rules or I would show her a maneuver and then like a minute later she would forget. 

I’m not trying to jump into diagnosing my kid with anything until I see her doctor.

How do you deal with teenagers dating when the parents have very different rules?,"I talked about this in another thread but wanted to get more advice without taking over someone else's post. 

My 16 year old son has a girlfriend. They started dating and then Covid shut everything down so they haven't been spending much time together in person but with restrictions starting to loosen and then going back to school a few days a week we have decided to allow them to hang out more. When it comes to the whole dating thing her parents are a lot more strict than we are. At her house they don't allow them in her bedroom with the door closed so the kids follow that rule here because the girlfriend is afraid of what will happen if they disobey her parents. 

I like to think I have a good relationship with my kids and my son has been open about the fact that sex has been discussed between the two of them. Now, I am not going to rent them a hotel room or anything like that but I had another discussion with my son about the importance of using condoms. His girlfriend is not allowed to be on birth control so it's even more important for him to use condoms. 

Would it be crossing the line to talk to the girlfriend about her different options for birth control? What about dropping her off at planned parenthood so she can talk about her options with a doctor? Is it okay to buy the morning after pill as an emergency back up or is that going to far? I don't even know if the girlfriend would be open to any of that. She does not like to disobey her parents but I thought that knowing she has one adult on her side may make things easier.

I’m not sure how much more I can handle,"I am so beyond pissed at SD13 and her disrespect

I’m going to try to make this short and to the point. 

Backstory: My BF and I have been together 6 years and lived together pretty much entire 6 years. He has full custody of SD13 and SS12. His mom also lives with us. She speaks no English and I speak very little Spanish. His mom and him are from another country and have been in the US for around 20 years. We also have custody of BFs nephew who is 13. His mom is fighting cancer and just started chemo this week. Bio mom is out of the picture for the most part. She comes around once in a while but usually stays away because her priority is drugs. 

His mom calls him today crying because SD and nephew got into a fight and SD threw a bottle of lotion at nephew and missed and it hit his mom. This poor woman is fighting for her life and SD can’t respect her and leave her the hell alone to rest. 
So BF gets home from work tells me what happened and yells at SD and tells her no electronics. SD was running m her mouth saying she was gonna call the cops if he touched her and was talking shit to BF. BF NEVER hits his kids and never really punishes them. 

Fast forward to right now (10pm) and BF is sleeping because he has to get up at 4am. I go into the kitchen and she’s sitting there playing on BFs laptop. I tell her to give it to me and she runs into his moms room talking crap to his mom and jumps into bed with her. Since I don’t want to bother his mom and she doesn’t want to listen to me fight with SD I just leave her room. SD knows his mom is sick and needs to rest but is such a brat she doesn’t care. I am so disappointed and disgusted with her. 

SD is selfish and disrespectful. I am disgusted with the way she acts and BF is too. I’m soooo mad and now have soooo much anxiety I can’t sleep. I want to wake BF up and tell him but am going to wait until morning. 

Is it bad that I wish bio mom would get her life together and take this damn kid. My life and everyone else’s would be so much calmer if she weren’t here. I feel like such a bad person for even saying that. I could go on and on and on about the crap SD has done just the past 6 months never mind the last 6 years.

She speaks no English and I speak very little Spanish. His mom and him are from another country and have been in the US for around years. We also have custody of BFs nephew who is 13. His mom is fighting cancer and just started chemo this week. Bio mom is out of the picture for the most part. She comes around once in a while but usually stays away because her priority is drugs.   His mom calls him today crying because SD and nephew got into a fight and SD threw a bottle of lotion at nephew and missed and it hit his mom. This poor woman is fighting for her life and SD can’t respect her and leave her the hell alone to rest.  So BF gets home from work tells me what happened and yells at SD and tells her no electronics. SD was running m her mouth saying she was gonna call the cops if he touched her and was talking shit to BF. BF NEVER hits his kids and never really punishes them.   Fast forward to right now (10pm) and BF is sleeping because he has to get up at 4am. I go into the kitchen and she’s sitting there playing on BFs laptop. I tell her to give it to me and she runs into his moms room talking crap to his mom and jumps into bed with her. Since I don’t want to bother his mom and she doesn’t want to listen to me fight with SD I just leave her room. SD knows his mom is sick and needs to rest but is such a brat she doesn’t care. I am so disappointed and disgusted with her.   SD is selfish and disrespectful. I am disgusted with the way she acts and BF is too. I’m soooo mad and now have soooo much anxiety I can’t sleep. I want to wake BF up and tell him but am going to wait until morning.   Is it bad that I wish bio mom would get her life together and take this damn kid. My life and everyone else’s would be so much calmer if she weren’t here. I feel like such a bad person for even saying that. I could go on and on and on about the crap SD has done just the past months never mind the last years. I don’t even know what to do about her anymore,39,9,2246,463,Teenager 13-19 Years

Teenage girl’s “frenemies”,"I check my daughter’s social media accounts and will come across conversations where she is very rude to her “friends.” Girls that she’s spent time with at sleepovers and such, but now are clearly not friends with.

I am always a proponent of learning from your own mistakes. If she pushes people away and ruins friendships, that’s her own fault. Surely she’ll learn to be a better friend. But I can’t stand that she would treat other people that way.

Was I being too harsh with my daughters last night?,"

Hi, so I have two daughters. A 17 and a 19 year old. I am a nurse and I work long 12 hour shifts. Since the pandemic started I’ve been having to work sometimes up to 6 days a week. My daughters both have been constantly at home since March. Neither of them have jobs (lots of unemployment here so places can pick and choose) but they are both going to school online currently. They both have their licenses and there is a car that they share that’s always available. I’m not sure if this matters but - The 19 year old is bipolar and has anxiety and the 17 year old has High functioning autism. Both do go to therapy online. And the 19 year old is on medication. 

Here’s the problem : I give them money to go buy food, they refuse to go to the grocery store to get themselves food. They both HATE driving. They both have a massive fear of driving. We live in a rural area so to get anywhere you need to drive. There is no public transportation. Also, I bought the 17 year old new glasses and they have been ready for over a month, she still hasn’t went and picked them up. The dogs and cats are out of hard food and they can’t be bothered to go to pet smart so they are just feeding them food they find in the refrigerator. I mean this is just getting ridiculous. There is no reason they can’t go get food for themselves, pick up cat/dog food and pick up your prescription glasses. They have more free time than I do. 

The last thing I want to hear when I come home from a long day at work is them whining that there is nothing to eat (there is food here just nothing they like), I only go to the store on my day off and if they refuse to tell me what they want or go with me then I just buy random food and either they eat it or don’t. 

I’ve had enough of it and I told them last night “you guys are 17 and 19 years old, if you don’t like what’s here to eat, then get in your car and go to the grocery store or make a list and I’ll go when I have the time. I don’t want to hear anymore whining about how there’s no food here when that could be solved if you went to the store and got food. You can’t use your anxiety as an excuse for everything. I work long hours and don’t have time to deal with this. I barely get a day off as is. There are people who have it way worse than you two, that have no choice but to fend for themselves. Also, *17 year olds name* why haven’t you picked up your glasses yet? The place is literally 10 minutes away. The place is not open when I go into work or come home from work so I can’t get them for you. I paid good money for those glasses, I suggest you go pick them up this week. This is just ridiculous. You guys are here all the time and rely on me to do everything for you. I don’t have time to do that. I am at work constantly. It’s time to put your big girl pants on and act a little more mature than how you’re acting now”",0,"Was I being too harsh with my daughters last night?   Hi, so I have two daughters.

self awareness and wisdom,"idk if this is correct place to ask

im 20 and my younger brother is 15

even though our parents have raised us similarly, we have been born in different timelines

i was born playing sports and going outside at a very early stages of life, i remember buying all the groceries for home when i was like 7 years old and even counting the money twice to make sure the shopkeeper didn't dupe me.

meanwhile my brother was born playing video games and rarely went/goes out(this is partly because it is no longer considered safe to send kids alone outside)
he has no sense of self awareness, like not sharing every personal info to a stranger. or like thinking on the fly, if a shop is closed he would return home instead of trying to find a different shop.

these are just common examples, but the problem goes even deeper

i know that these things come with age and some learn faster than others but how long will this last, when will he learn to not act like a robot and think for himself. most importantly - is there something that can be done",0,"self awareness and wisdom idk if this is correct place to ask  im and my younger brother is 15  even though our parents have raised us similarly, we have been born in different timelines  i was born playing sports and going outside at a very early stages of life, i remember buying all the groceries for home when i was like years old and even counting the money twice to make sure the shopkeeper didn't dupe me.  meanwhile my brother was born playing video games and rarely went/goes out(this is partly because it is no longer considered safe to send kids alone outside) he has no sense of self awareness, like not sharing every personal info to a stranger. or like thinking on the fly, if a shop is closed he would return home instead of trying to find a different shop.  these are just common examples, but the problem goes even deeper  i know that these things come with age and some learn faster than others but how long will this last, when will he learn to not act like a robot and think for himself. most importantly - is there something that can be done",25,4,1041,195,Teenager 13-19 Years

Teenage tantrums over room-sharing,"This might be a bit long and complicated, please bear with me. My husband and I have 4 kids, 2 girls are his from previous marriage who are 19 and 13, and 2 boys from this marriage who are 4 and 1 ½. The girls stay with us some weekends, or whenever they feel like it, which sometimes has meant we have not seen them for weeks before they decide to come. 

Our house has 3 bedrooms, a studio, and a converted garage where we have a play room, the laundry and also some storage. The girls each have their room and the boys have been sleeping with us in our room. Even though each girl has their own room with their respective dresser and bed, side table, etc., they sleep together in one bed every night they stay here. They really enjoy each other’s company which is great for them. 

Since they sleep together anyway, and they don’t stay here full time or even half-time, husband and I decided early last year that it was time for the boys to have their own room and the girls could move together into the bigger room. They both got emotional and husband said let’s leave it alone, the boys are still so little.

So again this year, before the pandemic hit, we asked the 19 year old if we could move the boys into her room since she’s moving to college (from Florida to Boston) and she’s going to be there for about 7-8 years at least, and she again cried for days, said we were trying to get rid of her, that she was here first and it was her room, and her dad said ok fine your room stays the same. She ended up moving back home this year because her dorm closed, but she’s moving back to Boston this week as they have now opened.

We revisited the subject again last week, and she now agreed that she and her sister could share the big room so that the boys could have their own room. This bigger room fits both girls’ dressers and it works perfectly because younger sister will have her ‘own’ room while the other is a college, and when oldest comes home, she will have all her things there as if she never left. When she comes home for holidays and breaks she said she could sleep with her sister. Everything so far sounds great right? Ok, here’s the big issue now. After moving the 13 year old’s dresser into her sister’s room, she is now crying and crying because she wants to have her room stay the same and not have to move in with her sister. She is very upset and is saying things like, ‘It’s not my problem that you decided to have more kids’, ‘turn the studio into a room and put them there’, ‘why do I have to suffer for your actions’, etc. She is also not talking to her dad because ‘she can’t forgive him for what he has done to her’.

My husband is now telling me that he doesn’t know what to do and is thinking about putting her dresser back. The boys could move into the bigger room but there is a big dresser, side table in there full of 19 year old’s things that doesn’t fit into the smaller room, so we would either have to keep all her things in the boys room or end up converting the studio into a bedroom, just to hold her things. 

I am telling my husband that we already made a decision, that he cannot keep holding this off just because they object and get upset. She will be upset for a week maybe and then she will be fine. That we should offer her emotional support but not give in because we would then be reinforcing this sort of selfish behavior. I told him the same thing when the oldest also refused to give up the room for her brothers the first time. He doesn’t agree, he thinks that she is a very sensitive child and he has to cater to her emotional needs. However, I don’t think this is a ‘need’, I think it’s a tantrum. I mean she is basically going to have a big room to herself and she barely comes here anyway! During the last semester her sister was away at college, she stayed here one weekend and we didn’t see her again till her sister moved back home. Why should our 2 boys who are here full-time have to share a room with us? My husband says I’m insensitive and I’m like this because I’m not her mom, but I feel like giving in to an illogical, purely emotional demand would actually be a disservice to her. Am I wrong?

Single dad seeking advice on Daughter's first period,"Hi everyone, hope you are doing well during this crazy time. 

My daughter got her first-period last month, and if my predictions are correct her next cycle is coming up soon. I'm seeking some tips and insight on how I can help my daughter through her first few periods. 

A little history: After losing my wife, I sought out advice from my mother and also some online resources on being a single dad. I had stocked up the so-called essentials, as well as tampons, pads, and two sizes of menstrual cups - This would prove to be my first mistake. Having all those choices in front of her would ultimately cause a lot of confusion which I could not help at all. Eventually, she settled on sanitary pads but noted it was very weird. I encouraged her to talk to her classmates about their preference, and promised I would research into what was better. 

I had the talk with her after this, answering all her questions about what and why. I was satisfied with myself. 

I bought her a Nintendo console she always wanted and had a pizza party to celebrate my little girl becoming a little lady! Hopefully, this didn't come across as being too freaky over the situation.

So, Reddit, could you kindly tell me what I could do to help her situation? Do I need to make any changes around the house, do I need to behave in a certain way during her period?

I am very grateful for any advice you may have for me since I don't have any sisters(or even cousins) to talk to about this. 

Thanks a lot!

Wanted: Creative Ideas to Help Quarantining Teenage Student,"First I want to be clear and acknowledge how very fortunate we are. My heart goes out to the families who don’t have the luxury of asking questions like this and I truly don’t want to be insensitive.

Here goes: 
I’m a single mom to a 15 year old boy, W. We live in a two bedroom, smallish apartment in Florida. W has a history of relatively serious asthma and bronchitis that he’s mostly outgrown. But here in Florida, the Covid numbers are so high that I’m terrified to send him to school with 3000 other kids who don’t wash their hands and physically distance themselves

I’ve been working from home since March and today is the third day of school. All the fun newness of school has worn off and the realization that we’re going to be doing this for the foreseeable future is sinking in. 

I have ADHD and W has a little depression and anxiety already. I know this isn’t an ideal situation for anybody, but I feel like it’s taking a little harder toll on us. 

I’ve heard of these neighborhood “pod” schools that are like mini-schools for neighborhood kids, but I don’t know how that would work for high school. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to create a better physical and social environment for W? 

TLDR: Two hormonal mouthy people living, working, schooling in the same tiny apartment day after day need some advice please. :)

my 15yr old daughter won’t go to school,I have a 15 year old daughter who has struggled with depression and anxiety. she is also diagnosed with bpd and odd. Her online school started last week. She logged in the first two days but hasn’t logged in after that. She stays in her room and isn’t very active out side of going to walmart with me. Every time me and my husband ask her about school she shuts down and doesnt speak and looks at the ground. the first time we asked her about it her hand even started to shake a bit. I am worried she has a history of suicidal thoughts and has had 3 suicide attempts. She is currently in therapy but i don’t know how to get her to do anything.

My 16yo was with her boyfriend unsupervised without me knowing,My other daughter (14) called me and told me that her sister (16)  had a guy over.  She invited her boyfriend to come over and somehow forgot to tell me which I don’t buy at all. I have been pretty lenient with her dating and seeing her boyfriend at his house supervised. I met the boy’s parents and it felt like I could trust her. I took her phone and all other electronics until school starts again. I also want her to apologize to his parent and inform them as well that there was no parent supervision. Supposedly the boy’s grandmother dropped him off knowing there was no parents around for some reason. I feel disrespected after I went over our rules early on and the risk that could happen. As far as know nothing sexual happened since I made him go home after I found out a few minutes later.,0,My 16yo was with her boyfriend unsupervised without me knowing My other daughter (14) called me and told me that her sister (16)  had a guy over.

Constantly bored teen,"SAHM with a constantly bored 17yo. My husband works from home since the pandemic and I mostly tidy up the house for the day.  She doesn’t have any close friends and just hangs out with people occasionally when they’re free. I find her most of the time just lying in bed doing nothing and then complains that there’s nothing to do. We live in a busy city and I don’t want her just wandering around aimlessly. Usually she’ll get up at around like 9 or 10 and go for a walk and that’s it for the rest of the day. 

At one point she was working at a grocery store, but they have been cutting down her hours tremendously. The last time I brought her to an actual shift was almost three weeks ago. My husband and I have responsibilities and can’t entertain her 24/7. She also has no license but is working on it. She used to play a lot of video games or watch YT videos that would keep her occupied for hours but now has no interest.,",0,"Constantly bored teen SAHM with a constantly bored 17yo.

A happy story about positive male role models.,"I have a set of teenage triplets (male). The 4 of us escaped a horrifically abusive marriage and started our new life. 2 of my boys would act out, get into fights, skip school, and we're almost always in trouble before we escaped. I was so afraid something would happen to one of my children. I placed all 4 of us in therapy but the biggest change in them was due to a positive male role model. My fiance moved in with us a couple of months ago and it has completely transformed my children. He takes the time to play basketball and football with them, he listens to them, most importantly he spends quality guy time with them. This is something they never got with their father. He understands that they are still traumatized by what happened and they are still grieving their father, he doesn't try to take that place he just spends time with them as a guy. I am so happy to have my children back and happy. Even their principal called and told me how proud he was of them. They haven't gotten in any trouble, they are making an effort to get their education, they are helping their teachers. A positive male role model is a powerful thing.

Back to school (sort of) schedule: PM internet access,"Hi All!
What time do you guys enforce bedtime for your early teenagers?
I’m the step-parent of a great 13-yo girl. For her last term in 7th grade she was in distance learning classes due to Covid, and still kept her grades up and achieved the Honor Roll. Proud of her. Heading into 8th grade distance learning in a couple of weeks. She was allowed to stay up pretty late this summer and wakes up between 11am-1pm, which I have to admit irritates me, but I figure, it’s summer and she really doesn’t have much reason to get up early. She does admit she can’t wake up early because she stays up watching TV or playing games. We didn’t regulate her internet access before this summer started. She has a TV in her room and has a smartphone device, both of which she uses often throughout the day. Currently I have her internet access  scheduled to be turned off at midnight on weekdays. 

Her online classes begin in two weeks and she’ll be logging in at 8:30 am. Seems a good idea to have her start going to bed at a decent time so she can get up in time to feed herself and do whatever she needs to prepare to log in to her video classes. I am thinking of shutting her internet off at 9pm with bedtime at 10.
Would love to hear what other parents are doing for their kids.",0,"Back to school (sort of) schedule: PM internet access Hi All! What time do you guys enforce bedtime for your early teenagers?

What would one do when your younger brother thinks he has everyone fooled,"My brother (17) has been sneaking weed pens, vapes, and apparently going to friends houses getting drunk (or coming home drunk and hiding it), as well as helping his friends selling overpriced vapes, cigarettes, etc to younger kids.

Balancing taking sports seriously while keeping expectations in check?,"We aren't a big sports family. My oldest does field hockey but it isn't something she takes super seriously.

He doesn't love school from an academic standpoint. He is dyslexic and has ADHD so he struggles a lot. Sports are were he excels and feels most at home. He plays the cello for his school orchestra but other than that his whole focus is on sports. 

I want to keep encouraging him but also want to keep expectations low. Very few kids earn D1 sports scholarships and I don't want him to focus so much on sports that everything else gets ignored. Right now he only keeps his grades up in order to be eligible for sports. I tell him all the time that he needs a back up plan but I don't think he takes it seriously.

My 15 year old has been drinking,"My 15 year old son has a very long history of ADHD and can be very impulsive and self critical. We have always parented him differently because of this. In the last few months he has been caught drinking 3 different times. The first time he got very sick from it and promised it would never happen again. We took his phone and computer away and had a very long conversation with him about the dangers of drinking. It stopped for a few months. Approx 2 weeks ago, he was drunk again. He did chores all the next day with a wicked hangover and we took his electronics away again  for a month. We also installed heavy duty locks on our liquor cabinet. 

Last night , my husband and I went to my brothers house to play cards with him and his wife. We were gone for approx 4 hours and were home by midnight. He seemed fine when we got home but a little cagey so we started looking around. We found a small, empty bottle of wine in the recycling outside that he had drunk while we were gone. We had accidentally left it out of the cabinet when we put the locks on it (it was in the garage. We were going to toss it in the trash and just forgot about it.) We also discovered that he had found his phone and texted his friends. 

I am not sure what to do next. Every time he has done this, he has texted his friends and posted on social media that he is drinking. It seems as though he is trying to be cool or something. 

We have also started homeschooling all 4 of our kids permanently because they were not going to be successful in a distance learning environment. He failed every class his freshman year of high school as well. His high school counselor said that his was the worst case of ADHD the high school had ever encountered.

What do we do now? I am at a loss. My husband and I both work full time. My husband works from home and I am an ER nurse so I go in 3 days a week for 12 hour shifts.

Driving anxiety with 17yo,"
Daughter (17) has been driving for almost a year now with her learners permit. She does just fine when driving with me and she also drives with her older brother. However, when she’s with her driving instructor on road lessons I always get a phone call home that she needs to better at driving.  I literally take her out almost everyday and haven’t had an issue at all. She gets nervous with the instructor and tenses up and it ruins almost every lesson.

DESPERATE! Out of Control Daughter!,"Divorced mom of three. 17 yr old boy, 15 yr old boy/girl twins. Divorced from their dad for 5 years. We are both remarried. They all get along fine with both step parents (meaning that there are no arguments or problems). Ex and I have a cordial/friendly relationship. No issues with each other's spouses. We have 50/50 custody.

My daughter has always been difficult. When she was a toddler she was the one who screamed all the way thru the grocery store. Growing up she was the one who always acted up at the dinner table and was sent to her room kicking and screaming. For the past 3 years now she's been absolutely miserable. Talking back and giving me attitude, being mean to her brothers, etc. Last year I took her to a psychologist and she refused to talk. At all. It was awful. 

Then a few months before COVID I thought it was getting a little bit better.  She would ask me to watch movies and would kind of ""hang around"" me and talk to me a lot more. But then COVID struck and since then she's been back to her old self, but even WORSE.

She's always angry. She swears all the time. She tells her brothers to ""fuck off"" and has recently started saying things like this to me. She refuses to do anything that I ask of her. I've tried taking away privileges like her phone, her laptop, etc, but it doesn't help. I've tried and tried to talk to her. I've asked her why she's so angry. I've asked her what I could do to help her. I get no where. 

Her brothers tell me that she acts the same way at her dad's house, but when I ask him about it he says ""she doesn't act that way with me"". 🙄 He's very passive. He tells me that he'll talk to her about it and tell her to stop, however, he won't back me up on any punishments I try to enforce. So whatever consequence I try to put in place, it gets undone when she goes to his house. The other day she once again told me to ""get the fuck out of her room"". I texted him and told him about it and asked if we could come up with some punishment that would apply in both households, because even if she doesn't act that way with him (like he claims), does he really want his daughter to be the type of person who's so disrespectful to ANY adult? He just now responded and said no to a joint-punishment. He said that he ""discussed it with her and she knows it's wrong to talk that way"" and that she ""was just tired"". He suggested that next time I ""calmly correct her"". 🙄 He also told me that I shouldn't continue to take stuff away from her because ""that's just going to piss her off even more"".

OMG! She is not 3 years old. She shouldn't need to be ""calmly corrected"". She ADMITTED that she knew it was wrong, so what's the point in correcting her anyway? And tired or not, that's no excuse for talking to your mother (or anyone) that way. I told him that I don't care if I piss her off because we're her parents and not her friends. 

If we all lived in the same house I wouldn't hesitate to be a hard ass and punish her however I saw fit. But since we're divorced, I try to hold off because I have such a big fear that she's just going to then ask to live at her dad's house full time and he'd allow it. And as mean and nasty as she is, that would break my heart. And it would break her twin brother's heart because he's always been so loving with her (even though she treats him like crap too)! And as irrational as I know this is, now that he's remarried I have the worry that his wife would just replace me in her eyes. 

I am not a perfect parent, but all in all I'm pretty easy. I don't ask a lot of them and I get them whatever they want and/or allow them to do anything they want, within reason. I am available when they need me. I encourage them to talk to me about anything and I don't judge. I've always been very loving and affectionate. All three of them are on honor roll. I have to add that I have absolutely NO issues with my boys. They are both sweet as can be. So I've obviously done something right?

Is this appropriate co-parenting?,"I have been my 16 year old son's primary parent since birth.  His father has every other weekend visitation which he has not always utilized.  He married his wife a few years ago and started spending more time with our son recently.  

Last week, my son wanted us to go shopping before school started for new things. I didn't think it was necessary as we have an abundance of brand new notebooks, pens, paper, note cards, highlighters, binders etc at home.  The only supplies ever needed on the first day are a pen and paper.  Class specific lists are given in class on the first day.  I buy whatever else is needed off of the lists the next few days after we receive them. No need to go buy things that we don't know if he will need or not is always my thinking.  

I had been out for the weekend and after a long drive, I laid down to take a nap. I opened my iPad after my nap to discover that my son had used it to chat with his step-mom. This is where I'm asking for advice.  I don't want to make a big deal or start a conversation with her about it for nothing. 

Step mom - ""Did your mom take you shopping for school supplies?""

Son - ""Nope, she didn't.""

Step mom - ""So, do you have a backpack? Paper? Anything?""

Son - ""I have a backpack. My mom said we have everything I need and I will be fine.""

Step mom - ""We just paid support on Friday. She must be using it for other things.  Is she home now?""

Son - ""Yeah but she's asleep.""

Step mom - ""I'm concerned she's sleeping when she could be taking you school shopping. Did you at least get new shoes""

Son - ""Yes.""

Perhaps my son has voiced some sort of worry to her about lack of supplies, and I appreciate her concern.  I don't feel it necessary or appropriate for her to tell him that she is concerned with my actions or to discuss finances with him.  It has always been a back and forth when he gets in trouble because his father doesn't carry punishments or consequences over to his home.  For example, my son had gotten grounded from his cell phone.  It made him upset so he called his dad to come get him, and his dad got him a new phone.  I only have a few years left of having to really communicate with his dad and I don't want to rock the boat if I'm overreacting. Nobody took the time to ask me personally if he had everything he needed or discuss any concerns, and it's really bothering me.",0,"Is this appropriate co-parenting?

Cellphones and deceptive behaviour,"My sister is 15 years old; she has been hiding and stealing from our rooms. She was caught several times already doing things she isn't supposed to, such as talking to foul-mouthed strangers (bad influences imo) on discord/PlayStation, taking my phone without permission and lying about where it is. She usually acts angrily towards me when she does this; that's when I know she's up to something.   
When confronted, she lies to my face and makes me run around in circles. 

I usually know what she's is doing. I only do this so she has a chance to come clean about what she has done; she never does.

Because of her past history, she had been banned from the internet, going on the PlayStation to communicate with others (she used to be allowed). She doesn't have a phone because of these behaviours and all of her friends do. It's been 3 years and her behaviour hasn't changed. Our family believes this is problematic. 

(She is still allowed to everything under supervision. She dislikes this so she reads books, wastes too time in the bathroom or watches TV.) I've told her if she acts more mature about these things I would buy her brand new phone and unrestricted some things.)

When we were kids, me and the older siblings, we asked if we wanted to listen to music, talk to friends on devices or whatever else we wanted to do, and of course, we would be allowed to do it under supervision.

What to do when your child subscribes to a radical ideology,"My son (16M) has always been progressive and voiced his opinions to me a lot.    
My lately I’ve noticed it’s take a turn farther left and I’m worried about the direction he’s going. 
Throughout this year I’ve noticed he’s been ordering books such as “state and revolution, the conquest of bread, and quotations from Mao Tse-Tung” 
I didn’t think much of this because he’s always purchased things like the unabomber manifesto, so I assumed it was just curiosity but after looking further into what he’s been doing online I found out he runs a political page with the following bio (this was linked to his Instagram account) - 

- ☭ Marxism-Leninism-Maoism ☭
   🚩Cultural Revolution 
   🚩Mass Line 
   🚩Internationalism 
   🚩Peoples War 

I was really concerned about this and after thinking about it for a while I tried to have a discussion with him but it didn’t lead anywhere.
He obviously knows more about this than me and I wasn’t able to convince him on anything. 
He has a lot of essays on that page and I would need someone more educated on these issues to get through to him.    

It’s a pretty large page and I think these people are reinforcing his beliefs.

Girlfriends 13 year old daughter is out of control,"Last night my gf’s 13 year old daughter stole her car and hit another car in a parking lot. Her behavior has been spiraling for about a year now but particular since the whole covid thing started. Lying, stealing, drugs, hanging out with questionable influences far older than her, being physically violent towards her parents, and now threatening to harm herself. And my guess is that she probably posted the car accident on social media. Maybe not.

Everyone (except her father who seems to be abdicating any adult authority) thinks she’s badly addicted to social media. Not that there’s not other things going on but she has an intense need to be popular. And that constant dopamine hit from her phone and the lack of daily structure during “quarantine” is pointing her life in a dangerous direction.

We took her phone away from her at which point she rummaged around for it and took it. After a couple of hours of back and forth she gave it back... and the proceeded to try to get it back again.

Frankly everything I heard from her sounds exactly like addict talk. “I don’t need it. I want it.” “I can put it down whenever I want.” She bargains, she blames, she threatens. 

Obviously she needs more structure and control asserted over her life. Her father is not making this easier since he would rather be buddies with her.

Im helping them find a counselor. But outside of that can anyone offer some advice?

Frankly everything I heard from her sounds exactly like addict talk. “I don’t need it. I want it.” “I can put it down whenever I want.” She bargains, she blames, she threatens.   Obviously she needs more structure and control asserted over her life. Her father is not making this easier since he would rather be buddies with her.  Im helping them find a counselor. But outside of that can anyone offer some advice? Her family is getting desperate.",50,9,1449,256,Teenager 13-19 Years
AGH TEEN,"Teen is having a hard time getting herself on schedule with online schooling. And I know online schooling sucks- it’s supposed to be the third day today but no teachers are online. She’s not going to sleep on time, which makes her so grumpy at me when I wake her up- I don’t want to start my day like that? (Don’t pick on me bc YOU went to sleep late *eyeroll*) She gets SO frustrated when she’s doing her work- literally just opening up the work she starts having a shitty attitude. 

So where do I draw the line between being controlling of the situation and letting her make her own decisions? Do I just let her figure this out on her own and possibly fall behind? Do I go cold turkey and turn WiFi off at night and FORCE her onto a schedule? I ask her to make her own schedule and she hasn’t done it yet. This is her first year of high school &amp; she wants to go to college after highschool so I don’t want to baby her for the rest of highschool. I want her to be independent enough to be getting the things she needs to done without me having to double check her work.",0,"AGH TEEN Teen is having a hard time getting herself on schedule with online schooling.

How to motivate my kid to prepare for college more enthusiastically,"I'm asking on behalf of my parents since they don't have a reddit account.

My 16 yr old kid isn't very enthusiastic about preparing for college. Instead, he likes to play video games all day. So far, punishments involving taking away his video games have had little effect.

All Our Work Will Be Undone,"My daughters have lived about 3 hours from me nearly all of their lives. I’d get them every other weekend (give or take) for many years. My oldest (now 15) had gotten into drugs, a bad crowd that she’d become very close with, and her relationship with her mom disintegrated rapidly. She moved into our home about 10 weeks ago. Our household is very different from her moms house; we support creativity; communication; honest transparency; and a wealth of positive and supportive values. 
Since she’s been with us, we’ve had several setbacks arise for a variety of reasons. We continue to work hard with her and we do feel like every day is better than the last. With school quickly approaching, she still seems to have a thought in her mind that she MAY go back to her Moms in order to go back to school there as opposed to here. In some of our arguments, I regularly finding myself saying things like “after everything we’ve done for you, you just want to go back to Moms and undo everything we’ve worked on?!”
My question to the community, how can I learn to rethink our situation and not feel like all the work I’m trying to instill in her will just be wasted  if she leaves? I worry that if she goes, she’ll get back into drugs, her relationship with her mom will never recover, and things will just go south fast. I feel like I may be selfish or come across as guilt tripping her, and I hate it that I may be doing that and not fully realizing it. Hopefully someone has a relatable experience and can tell me how to change my way of thinking.",0,"All Our Work Will Be Undone My daughters have lived about hours from me nearly all of their lives.

At a loss of what to do for my 16 year old son,"I'm posting this on behalf of my mother who has a problem with my 16 year old brother. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My brother has dropped out of High School (grade 11), very abruptly. He stopped going and my mother is a single one works in healthcare and was unable to control if he went or not. We are getting him into a community college type of thing that we have in our country (a 1st world western, not America) so he can obtain certifications for University. My mother is worried something is wrong. My brother is a recluse and rarely comes outside of his room, we have to knock 5+ times to speak to him or let him know food is ready etc. We can go a whole week without seeing or speaking to him. If we try to get serious and talk to him he just shuts his door, yells at us or ignores us completely. My mother has never really punished him but there's nothing to punish him with since he doesn't have friends and stays inside all the time. We can take his computer away but that's basically it. Why haven't I done anything? Well I'm 22 and can't do anything since I'm not his father and every bit of help elicits that response. Not sure what we should be doing. We can get him to therapy but how do we get him there if he just says no and locks himself in his room. We had to struggle to get him to take a professional photo for his passport. For reference he's the third child, I'm the first and our sister is the middle. My sister and myself are in University. We think something bad might have happened at High School since he stopped going to suddenly and refused to go back to submit his enrolment form. I had to do it. Advice would be great! My personal worry and maybe my mum shares this as well. I had people in High School commit suicide when I went there and also a few friends that became ""drop kicks"" and didn't move forward in life. We've never forced anything onto him, my mum is very open and lets us make our decisions as long as we're working or studying. There's probably more to add but I can't think of anything so i'll answer any questions that need more context.

My teenage son annoys me.,"My 15 year old son annoys the heck out of me.  Since the pandemic began, he is now of course around 24/7 since school was virtual from home and his part time job has closed down due to Covid.  It had just been decided that for at least the first marking period of the new school year will be virtual as well and I doubt he will have football practice either.  Keeping up with his schooling is a nightmare because I literally have to stand over his shoulder and check everything since he lies about everything and will tell you he has done his homework - knowing full well he has not - and high schoolers have a lot of homework! 

He’s is messy and dirty, I have to remind him multiple times every single day to shower, brush his teeth, wash his face and wear deodorant - and to actually use soap and a loofah when he showers! 

All he cares about is Xbox and the only time he ever says more than two words it’s to drone on and on about stuff from whatever game he is into at the time.  I have to limit his game time to 2 hours and then take away his remotes - otherwise if allowed he would literally lay in bed and play nonstop from the time he wakes up to the wee hour of the night.  He often tries to sneak them back when he thinks we aren’t paying attention or going out for an errand.  

His other obsession is his phone - which I have found loads of very sick and disturbing anime porn downloaded on multiple times.  Call me a prude, and I know people will tell me “it’s a boy thing” but the stuff is seriously gross and well, disturbing.  We have had to activate parental controls on the phone because he just won’t listen when told to stay away from inappropriate sites/apps and I worry about him having a very unhealthy habit/addiction.  

If he gets grounded from his electronics he just lingers around me moping and moody hoping I’ll feel sorry for him and unground him. He is also only very really nice when he wants something, otherwise he is very rude and disrespectful. He steals from my room and my purse all the time.  

I can’t watch movies or tv with him because he literally sits and narrates/talks through the ENTIRE movie, and the pulls up YouTube clips of it and tells you what’s going to happen before it happens.

His room is gross and he leaves wrappers garbage everywhere.  He has been told not to eat in his room- a rule he constantly defies.  He has had mice in his room as a result and I found a dead mouse once- that he apparently knew was there - but didn’t bother dealing with.  🤢 I had to get a cat and move the cat into his room to get rid of the problem.  

Then, getting him to eat a normal balanced healthy diet is like pulling teeth.  He will sit there at the dinner table with the same spoonful of vegetables in his mouth for like 30 minutes - like a child.  And has been caught multiple times trying to low-key spit them out in a napkin while pretending to sneeze or spit them in the garbage or toilet.  I mean seriously.  It’s frustrating because I literally can’t leave the table until I’m sure he is done eating and swallowing otherwise he would eat nothing but bread and meat. (And candy of course)

I feel like I have to spend more time monitoring, correcting and micromanaging him than I do for my other two, much younger, children.

I love him of course as he is my son, and overall not a terrible person - other people always tell me what a good kid he is (when not at home) so that a good thing.  But, I am really dreading being stuck with him 24/7 for another school year and can’t wait until this is all over and he goes back to being gone at school/ practice and work most of the time.  ***Sigh.

I’m 15 and I got caught sneaking out in May. My mom still won’t let me on social media.,"Ok so regardless what the title may say, I’m not spoiled nor entitled. I’m going into high school in a district I’ve never been to. I don’t know anyone there. In May I snuck out for an hour and a half. I was in my friends car and we were just hanging out and getting to know each other because I’ve been completely isolated by my mom and I was tired of what felt like abuse. I got caught and mind you I’ve never touched a drug in my life nor have I ever snuck out prior to this. I wasn’t sexually active until my mom became a drug addict and didn’t take care of me for 2 years (she’s clean now and hasn’t used her drug of choice in almost 3 years).

Alcohol resources for son leaving for college?,My son is leaving for college next week. I’ve done a great job with him in terms of educating him on the dangers of drinking and driving. Unfortunately he seems to think that occasional heavy drinking itself is fine and the only negative thing that can come from it is maybe a bad hangover. Does anyone have suggestions on documentaries or shows that demonstrate alcohol poisoning in partying young adults or teens that might have a good impact on him that we can watch before he leaves? He seems to think that as long as they drink and stay in one place they can drink as much as they want. He is 18 now and has tried sips of beer at his dads house. It is not like he’s going to get to campus and start drinking huge amounts of alcohol or anything but he needs to understand that excessive drinking is dangerous even if you’re not driving.

AITA?,"My daughter, 13, is doing some “manifesting” whereby she writes “secrets” on plates and then destroys them (she bought plates and a sharpie from the dollar store with her own money.)

Today, when I got home from work, she had left a plate with writing on it on the table, so I read it. It was out in the open with no attempt at it being in a private place - ie her desk or her room. 

In it she talked about sending nudes to boys, wanting to be able to “vibe” with someone and how much she misses her dad (they’re estranged). 

It came up later in the evening and I told her I’d read what she wrote and now she’s accusing me of violating her privacy, failing a “test” and reaffirming her earlier accusations that she hates me, doesn’t respect me and that I am a person of “low moral values.” 

Things are difficult in general with her as she figures out who she is, but truly, I am most concerned about her health, safety and well being. I am responsible for her, after all. 

I give her wide latitude in her online life - she has Instagram and snap chat despite my better judgement and full access to her phone at pretty much all hours. 

I am a single working parent with zero help from her dad and doing my best to navigate these waters. I was molested by my father and my mom was complicit in it so I have no idea what I’m doing here bc I know my childhood wasn’t “normal” and unfortunately, neither is my daughter’s bc I didn’t get any therapy before I hooked up with her dad and of course, he’s basically the narcissist without pedophilia that my own dad was. 

I’m not above apologizing if I’ve mis-stepped here but I have zero perspective and am triggered deeply by so much of what she says about how I’m worthless and a horrible mom when I work so hard to be a good, kind and loving parent. 

I’m sure I’ll be ripped to shreds over this but also curious if other parents have experience being hated by their children and you grew to have healthy loving relationships?",0,"AITA?

"My sweet, possibly autistic son","When he was only a few days old, I noticed he wouldn’t look at my eyes, but would focus on my forehead or eyebrows instead. Doctor said that was normal. Around a year old, he had still not hit the developmental milestone of pointing to something he wanted. A lot of times he would ignore me when I called his name. Doctor still said normal. 

He didn’t really babble like other babies do, and spoke late. He started really talking around 2 and a half, and suddenly had an impressive vocabulary at 3. Doctor said that is common in boys. 

This kid had no sense of fear or danger. He would often wander off and not notice or care that I wasn’t there. I’d be frantically searching for him, only to find him looking at something or happily chatting with an adult somewhere. 

He was very focused on certain things. When he was 2, he loved toy cars. He would push them slowly around on different surfaces and intently watch the wheels spin.

When he was 3, he became obsessed with Blue’s Clues. He’d watch the same episodes over and over, and later would walk around the house reciting them word for word. I made him a little “handy dandy notebook” and he would go around writing the “clues” in his notebook. He didn’t really make up stories with his toys but would use them to reenact scenes from his favorite shows. 

When he was 4, we put him in a co-op preschool. On the days I was in the classroom, I’d notice that he never interacted with the other children. Sometimes a child would ask him to join them, and he’d say “no, thanks,” and continue to do what he was doing. The teacher said some kids are just like that. 

He was a young 4, so we decided to have him repeat preschool when he was 5. He finally bonded with another child, one who was equally obsessed with Buzz Lightyear (his current interest at the time). I was so excited that he finally had a friend for once! I became friends with the child’s mom and we had regular play dates for the kids. 

In elementary school, my son did have a few friends (unfortunately his preschool friend didn’t go to his school) but he always was the leader and organizer of the play. Up until 4th grade, he’d bring his Pokémon stat book to school, and he and his friends would talk about which Pokémon they wanted to “be” and then have an imaginary “battle” with my son as the judge as to who won. He had that entire book of 600+ Pokémon memorized, along with their height, weight, and abilities, and even at home, he loved to talk about who would beat who. 

Unfortunately in 5th grade, his friends grew out of their interest in Pokémon while my son remained obsessed. When I’d ask what he did at recess, he’d say he sat and “meditated.” At home, it was hard to talk with him about things like how his day went, or how he felt about things. He spent a lot of time in his room reading or “thinking.” I’d often overhear him talking to himself about Pokémon and making battle sound effects. When he did make his appearance, he would talk and talk about Pokémon or whatever else he was into. It was difficult to have a meaningful two-way conversation with him about anything. 

He’s 15 now and has a good little group of friends in school who are also into fantasy and D&amp;D (his current interest). However, now that school is virtual, he makes little to no effort in contacting them. He’s not interested at all in social media or texting a friend just to chat. We did have a couple of his friends come to our house on his birthday over the summer, and he seemed to have a genuinely good time with them, but he never asks to have anyone over. I think he’s mostly just happy in his own little world with his books and his imagination. 

He’s an incredibly sweet boy who is very cooperative and easy. He loves his routine and does all his chores and schoolwork without us having to remind him. The only time he really gets upset is if we change his routine without prior notice, or if his little brother is in his space without his consent. His room is impeccable, with every single item having a place. He’s always been like this; my sister laughs about a time she babysat him when he was around 2 or 3, and when she was helping him clean up his toys, he corrected her and showed her the “right” way to do it. He has a very calm demeanor, and will teach his younger brother how to do things in a very patient and informative way. I call him The Professor sometimes because he uses a very formal speech pattern and big words. 

Throughout his life, I have often wondered if he is on the autism spectrum. He just ticks off so many boxes. I have asked his pediatricians and all his teachers, and they assure me that he is “quirky” but “normal”. However, I have had many people in my family and social circle who also have mentioned that they think he could be autistic. I guess in a way it doesn’t even matter? 

I love him the way he is, and I think that he has a lot of amazing characteristics. He doesn’t seem to really notice or care when someone is teasing him; it seems like everything just kind of rolls off his back. He has a great sense of what he likes and wants, and he doesn’t care what anyone else thinks about it. He is always very motivated to learn more about things that he is interested in. He was tested for GATE in 3rd grade, and ranked very highly. So he has been in accelerated classes since then. He especially excels in math and I could see him easily getting a job in engineering or computers after college. 

Sometimes though, I just want to know. I’ve thought about ignoring what the doctors say and just taking him somewhere to get tested, but I don’t really want to make it a big deal. I’ve never mentioned my suspicions to him either, I only discuss it with people when he is not around.

My daughter won't pursue a career,"My daughter is 16 and I tried very hard to accommodate her needs since I'm still responsible until she is 18. She hated middle school and I know it was because of bullying. Every other week, I talked to her teacher, had meetings and spoke with the principal. They worked hard with her to fix it, but she lost motivation. We got into counseling, but it didn't help me when she didn't want to go to school. It was a constant struggle every day to get her into school, but I still had to deal with truancy. Once she got into the 9th grade, it was 10x worse, so I signed her out.

 I got her into home school and counseling, but she didn't want either one. I'm trying to help her get a general education certificate. If she just takes the classes and learns the basics, she can test and get the certification. She doesn't want to do that either. The next two years are going to be rough if she has no motivation. She thinks I'm forcing her to get an education, but she tells me all the time that she wants to be a veterinarian. The goal is terrific. I applaud her for having it, but she needs to put in the work. I can give her a break, but it can last forever if I don't give her a timeline. 

I'm pulling my hair out right now. I have two other children and I don't want to be slapped with fines and court if she doesn't do something. Once she turns 18, I have to let it go.

I don’t want the punishment to be so severe that he rebels even further but I don’t want to continue to let these things happen because he shouldn’t have to try everything out before he learns his lesson. How do we get through to him before his behavior causes much more severe, serious consequences?",43,7,1285,237,Teenager 13-19 Years

Advice on ways to support my(21F) baby sister (18),"Hi everyone! 

A few months ago my baby sister was diagnosed with alopecia! 

I know this is incurable and is really taking a toll a her self esteem! 

She had been fighting major depression and suicide for as long as I can remember, has a history of self harming, and she is currently living with an abusive boyfriend (in all the ways) 

we cannot reach out to our parents, as our father is a raging alcoholic and our mom is just ... well the lights are on but no ones home... 

 the other day she hitched-hiked home (45min-1hr) in the back of two adult mens truck. She was telling me how good it made her feel when these men were telling her how hot she is, especially when they told her that she’s gonna be “banging” when she’s older .. this makes make sick! and shows how bad she’s truly feeling about herself 

I remember when i was diagnosed with crohn’s and RA at her age, it added to my feelings of worthlessness and self hatred... and having an abusive alcohol father definitely didn’t help!

she also in college completing her program in a Pandemic! 

I love my sister so so sooooooo much and i’m almost scared for her life:( i really want to support her and help her and be there for her in every single way that i can! but im not sure how... 

any advice helps!

My parents took away my sister's privacy and I want to get it back for her,"My (age 24) sister (age 18 in 2 months) is still living with our parents and they've downloaded a secret spy app on her phone. (She only knows about it because she saw mom's screen over her shoulder)
The app tracks her location and gives them access to her apps, text messages, calls, search history, and sets time limits. This is a serious violation of human rights and I need to help her get that privacy back.

Some of you may have a number of arguments for the app, so I'll address them:
1. My sister bought this phone with her own money and pays her own phone bill. Our parents didn't help her in the slightest, other than to set it up in the first place. It's hers, not theirs. 
2. She doesn't go anywhere alone. She's doing online school, doesn't hang out with friends outside of our parents' home, and only goes places with trusted family. She even works with our brother (22) during his shifts. A location tracker is useless to her.
3. She doesn't have any interest in porn or a significant other, so the app is useless if they're trying to monitor her for that.
4. Her most common uses for her phone are a) to text her siblings (including myself) memes and jokes, b) help her friends through PRIVATE mental health issues, and to c) look up things during bible study. (Oh my goodness! What evil things could she look up in order to understand a bible verse more? Gasp.)
5. She will be a legal adult in 2 months. She's a good girl and is more of a responsible adult than I am.

My question is how can I help her? She already has depression and anxiety due to past issues and this is just going to make it so she won't trust anyone. Including the people who are supposed to make her feel safe.

(Also, I know several people who had this kind of app as a teenager and were later in abusive relationships because ""it's normal for people who love you to spy on you!"" and it scares me to think she'll do the same at some point)",0,"My parents took away my sister's privacy and I want to get it back for her My (age 24) sister (age in months) is still living with our parents and they've downloaded a secret spy app on her phone.

Need Advice For Teen Boy,"My wife and I are trying to encourage our thirteen-year-old boy to be more active. He’s not overweight, but has gained a good bit since he turned 11 and is embarrassed of the way he looks. 

His mother and I have him play soccer just about year-round, but he puts very little effort in when playing or practicing.

We bought him a Fitbit and have him get 10,000 steps in a day and have tried different rewards for getting the goal. The rewards don’t work and he’s fine sitting around and not getting his steps. So, we tell him if he doesn’t get his goal, he has to make up steps the next day before he can get electronic time. That didn’t work out because he just didn’t have electronics and was miserable. His complaint was that it took all day.

We gave him more options... If he came to the gym with us for an hour, that can count as his daily steps. The days he practices/plays soccer and puts in effort, that can count for his steps.

So, now he doesn’t try for his step goal, he wants to go to the gym with us, but puts in the minimal amount of effort, but he has started trying more in soccer. On days we go to the gym, he sits around and doesn’t do anything because he knows it’ll be extra effort than he’s required. He got frustrated that today was a gym day because he wanted to do something else, but doesn’t want to do more activity than is required. We tell him “You don’t HAVE to go to the gym. It’s just ONE way to be active.”

We’ve had him visiting with a child psychologist/counselor and she is not concerned about depression, but has yet to offer any guidance on how to motivate him more. However, the psychologist has been able to get him to open up more (something that was a separate concern of ours) so we don’t want to find another one.

We’re not sure how else to help motivate him. I know it’s common for teenagers to be lazy, but we feel as if this is more than just lazy. It’s complete lack of motivation.

Parents gave me condoms in my Easter Eggs at 13,"—You’ll make mistakes, but talk to your children about the hard. Even when it’s hard. 

It took me years to understand. My parents always had large parties hundreds of guests would come now I am able to hold a conversation with anyone, but I think they skipped over much of the “parenting” aspects of “parenting.” 


So, hello parenting subreddit. Let me introduce myself. I am 22 now and as the title suggests I had many experiences that seem questionable to me as an adult. Like putting condoms in my Easter eggs. By the time I was 14 I was drinking and partying with peers 4-6 years older than me. Also my parents made alcohol normal at that age as well. I just want to understand some normality. So parents, is that normal? I guess do parents normally have conversations with there kids about sex? Or do they just get condoms in there are Easter eggs and say don’t get pregnant because for me that was so traumatizing. And before you ask,

Let me introduce myself. I am now and as the title suggests I had many experiences that seem questionable to me as an adult. Like putting condoms in my Easter eggs. By the time I was I was drinking and partying with peers 4-years older than me. Also my parents made alcohol normal at that age as well. I just want to understand some normality. So parents, is that normal? I guess do parents normally have conversations with there kids about sex?

18 year old daughter is struggling being away at college. How can I make this easier?,"Last Sunday I dropped my daughter off at college. She has a mandatory 2 week quarantine period on campus. After the 2 weeks is up she'll be able to move in with her roommate and can walk around campus with a mask and hang out outside without a mask but she can't do any of that right now. She has lunch in a common area with the same 15 people everyday but social distancing rules are enforced. It will NOT be this way forever. It's just the first 2 weeks before classes even start to slow the spread. 

She's having a really hard time with it. Transitioning to college is never easy but at least in normal circumstances kids can distract themselves with campus events, classes, and making friends. She's not able to do that. I have 2 younger boys who are having a hard time with their sister not being here too. My older son is 16 and my younger one will be 15 this week. The younger one was upset yesterday and said he misses how life was before. I asked if he was talking about his sister being here or pre Covid times and he said, ""All of it. I miss all of it."" My daughter called me crying last night saying that this is all so hard. She isn't a crier. I asked her if she wanted to come home and she said she wants to stick it out and see how things are once campus really opens up but I could hear how much she was hurting. She has been talking to her friends from home, most of which are still here, and is missing doing things with them. She's missing hanging out with her brothers. She said she tried to watch a show she watches with her brothers but couldn't because it was too hard. I encouraged her to reach out to someone at school and she said she will but is there anything else I can do from home? I can't go visit her.

Need help with daughter's friend,"My daughter is a young teenager.  My daughter (MD) and her friend (DF). MD told me that DF has admitted that she liked MD previously.

At my wits end...,"I’ve (20F) been taking full time care of my sister (14F) for almost a year. Since I was 15 though, she’s been with me jumping from house to house. I couldn’t work an actual job at 15 and was stealing food and water for her from school and stores around town and doing side gigs every weekend to buy her clothes. Once I could work at 16, I quit school and worked full time- bought her takeout every night since we didn’t have a kitchen, always made sure she had clean and new clothes for school. 

At 18, I got my first apartment- 2 bedrooms so she could stay w me. She stayed with me until my mom demanded her back. Towards March 2019, she fought me twice- once broke every mirror and glass in my house because I caught her with a vape, and the second time almost broke my eye socket and broke all the windows. 

I limited contact with her after that, but in October 2019 she fought with my mom and mom had her leave the house to stay with me. She kept running away from me, but hadn’t hit me so I figured the sass is something I could handle. 

And now 2020- I’m renting a house. First time for 6 years that we’ve had an actual house to live in with our own rooms. I’ve bought her all brand new things to decorate with. We found two kittens that’s she’s been happy with. Our mom and brothers have been with us here as they haven’t had a good home to stay in. Yesterday, I was about to buy her an Apple laptop she’s been asking for forever, but we decided to order online so she could get a different color. 

About an hour ago she came out of her room yelling at my little brother then slammed her door. I opened the door back up and told her not to slam it- like I’ve told her for the past 3 months. She slammed it again, opened it back up, and grabbed me by hair and started hitting me. I was in so much shock that she’d even put her hands on me again. I told her to leave the house. She broke the screen door, then started throwing big rocks at all of the windows. I haven’t even gone outside yet to see the damage. My mom told her to cut it out and come back inside. I took the TV from my sisters room afraid she’d end up damaging it. She came out chased me around the house and started hitting me again. Luckily my mom pulled her off. She started throwing all of her things out of her room and down the stairs- probably all broken now. My mom said not to call the cops and that I’ll be the one getting arrested if I call- she said she can’t risk exposing herself or the littles ones to COVID if my sister is taken down to the police station. 

My little sister has been admitted to the hospital twice for suicide and been arrested previously when my eye socket was almost broken. I’ve spent the past 4 years working non stop- 6 days a week, 13 hours a day to take care of my family w 5 siblings. All I’ve asked is that everyone be respectful in my home so I don’t get kicked out and don’t set a bad name for myself amongst realty companies. I’ve asked my mom numerous times over the past 5+ years to get her a therapist because of her behavior. She refuses to because she’s scared it’ll make a bad name for herself- same reason why she won’t give me full custody of my sister so I could do make these appointments myself. 

I have nothing left to give already. I’ve wiped myself clean mentally. I’ve been giving all I’ve had over the past few years to make sure my family has a roof over their heads and food in their mouths. I’ve been doing all of the labor, the budgeting, the planning and have just asked that everyone just be respectful in return. I’ve sat down with my sister and have talked with her about the problems she’s faced and have been trying to teach her to have a conversation instead of fighting. I’ve been trying my best to do everything right and I still get attacked and ridiculed and disrespected. I’ve wanted to start my own life for so long- go traveling, go to university, meet new people. I’ve been okay with putting it all to the side if that meant I could be giving a better life to 6 of my family members. It all just seems like shit now. I just needed some place to let this out.

[Update] 14 year old son's being 14 - help?!?,"[Original post here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/i499t8/14_year_old_sons_being_14_help/)

First, thanks for all your advice - as you will see below, I've been listening.


We met for an hour and I told him how I was probably trying to overcompensate for the limited time I had with him and it could not have been much fun.


Without bringing up his mom's family, I told him I was probably projecting my biggest fear - that he'd grow into a less-than-competent adult male, someone I'd love, but not respect. I said that I would back off on this, as he had shown no signs of heading that way.


I told him I firmly believe that our value system has helped make us the most successful immigrant community America, which was why I was trying to ingrain said values. I told him I am, of course, still the same person with the same values and expectations, but would learn to trust him to embody and live them.


I told him that I'd like to meet him to do stuff, so I'd have an opportunity to show that I was treating him as a person (vs a project) if he was up for it.


And, to appease the ""feelings"" crowd &lt;bad joke&gt;, yes, I did tell him I loved him and missed him.


We agreed to meet tomorrow for a jog with the dog and he's promised not to laugh at me gasping for breath as I try to keep up with them. He cracked a smile a couple of times during our conversation, so I am hoping that this is fixable in time.

Should I force 16 year old to start waking early in preparation for online classes on end,"Brief background: My cousin had multiple issues (mental, financial, etc) which lead to our family (siblings, parents) taking care of her daughter. For all intents and purposes, I (single 33F) have been acting like my niece's parent for the past 10 years.

---

As the title says, should I keep keep forcing my 16 year old niece to start waking up early in preparation for her online classes that would start on August 24?

&amp;nbsp;

Our country has been in lockdown since March and since it was summer vacation, I've been letting her wake up as late as 12 noon. Because her classes are nearing, I've been trying to get her to build a habit of waking up early so that she wouldn't have a hard time adjusting once school starts. This would be the first time she'd be having online classes. Her school will be having classes via video conferencing (Zoom) 3 days a week and it would start as early as 8 AM. The other 2 days are for self study.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been trying to make her wake up early since July but it's not working at all. 90% of the time she's still waking up very late and I'm at the point of giving up due to frustration. She's a teenager and she knows the consequences of her actions. If she has a hard time once school starts then that would be on her.

Please tell me about any experiences that you have had with teens and antidepressants,"My 13 year old son is very sweet and has what I would consider to be a melancholy personality that has always worried me. I feared that this would make him predisposed to full-on depression at some point in his life. Now that time has come. 

With the coronavirus situation we all find ourselves in and all of the isolation and major life changes, he is in major depressive episode. We have started him in therapy, which we are lucky that our insurance at least partly covers. His pediatrician has recommended that we consider medication based on the severity of his experience. I am open to considering medication, but would like to hear about any experiences you have had, good or bad, with treating children with antidepressants. I just have zero experience with this and any personal experiences or perspective would be helpful. To hear. Have they been effective?  Have they caused major side effects? 

Thanks so much. I just love my boy and want to do whatever I can to help him through this.",0,"Please tell me about any experiences that you have had with teens and antidepressants My year old son is very sweet and has what I would consider to be a melancholy personality that has always worried me.

Have you refused to pay for your child's college if not agreeing with his/her Major?,"Dear Parents of older teens - have you refused to pay for your child's college tuition OR refused to co-sign a loan for college IF you totally disagree with the child's choice of MAJOR?  If you feel that their choice of major will NOT help them obtain a job after graduation and you then feel that their college years will be a big waste of money, have you tried to explain this to your child?  Have you tried to get them to choose a different, more marketable major and career path?  What happened? Did it work?  I am asking because my brother's daughter has not spoken to him in about 3 years because he did not feel her choice of major - fine arts at an expensive school - would guarantee her income after graduation.  He did not want to be the Co-Signer person responsible to pay back expensive loan payments while she worked a job at a supermarket or retail store.   She now wants nothing to do with her own father.

14 year old son's being 14 - help?!?,"**I could really use your advice…**

**Background**: Culturally Asian dad, now divorced for 6 years from culturally western mom. Got custody ~30% of the time as son was 8 at the time.


Ex wife's family raises strong (but incredibly overprotective) women but…how do I say this delicately…absolutely spineless men. Father in law ""retired"" in his early 50's and lives off his wife and the state. Brother in law has never held a job and lives off his wife. Kid's mom won't let him cross a street or do anything alone.


Due to my limited time with him, every minute has become a ""teaching moment"" where I would try to instill the lesson that life in the US is basically an open-book exam: arm yourself with academic prowess, a strong work ethic, the ability to think rationally and without emotion,show competence in day-to-day tasks and you have the foundations of success.

I thought my son and I had a great relationship. We'd go hiking, do yard work, walk the dog, travel abroad, watch football, cook together all the while busily giving him ""life lessons"", which he seemed to take to heart – he has straight As, does chores without grumbling and is generally a nice, pleasant kid. In retrospect, my lessons appear to have no resonated with him, something I was blissfully unaware of at the time.


I asked him several times if he wanted to change the custody arrangement to spend more time with me and he said yes, even going so far as to hug me after saying ""let's do it"". The ex-wife was having none of it, so I turned the (expensive) lawyers loose only to get a 3-page list of complaints from my son. Turns out he feels “criticized”, feels angry, and now won't even see me unsupervised. Conversations are stilted and he's dropped all his responsibilities (walking the dog, mowing the lawn, etc.) with his mother's blessing - feelings are apparently more important than responsibilities in this alternate universe.

I get to see him in 2 hours.

Divorces on preteen/teen,"This is very complicated, so hang in there. I was unofficially “adopted” by my family when I was 18/19. I’m 20 now. Since coming around, my little “sister” has always looked up to me. She views me as her older sister and best friend, but consistently comes to me for motherly advice too. She’s 12, almost 13. Most people think we are the same age because she’s very mature, well spoken, intelligent, and overly sassy😂🙄. Her parents are not getting along. They hardly speak, and divorce is talked about often. Her mom doesn’t want one, but her dad does, and for very good reasons. She’s an only child so she would stay living with her mom because her dad doesn’t want to hurt her mom, but she’s the epitome of a daddy’s girl. She knows divorce is being talked about, and she sees how her parents are. Her dad always spends time with her, talks to her, makes an attempt to learn things she likes even when he hates them, but her mom does none of those things. She’s asked me “is it worse to have divorced parents or to know they fight all the time?” She asked me this because my bio parents are divorced. I guess my point in this post is how can I help? How do I respond? She knows the basic reasons this is happening, but I don’t want to place blame on either parent. Should I take her from the house more? Should I just let her talk and not respond? Any advice would help. I’ve been through this but it wasn’t the same.

Wtf teen,"I walk away from the toddler to use the bathroom. The teen doesn’t listen about keeping the large window closed until I order the window bars so he won’t fall out. This house is old and the screens fall out easily. 

I go to use the bathroom. Come back find and the toddler is climbing up onto the OPEN window ledge (that I repeatedly said to LEAVE CLOSED). 

I get toddler off and tell teen the screen was ABOUT TO FALL OUT. Her reply is “well not like that’d be a bad thing if he fell out” WTFFFFFF SERIOUSLY

Issues with my parents,"I don’t know where else to post this but I am a 17 year old male.

My parents are very traditional Asian parents, they consistently remind me that going to university is the only way to achieve a happy life. My marks are not up to par with what they expect of me and as a result they do not believe I can live a happy life and we always fight over this. They genuinely think I’m going to end up in a fast food joint for the rest of my life if I don’t go to uni. 

I am not opposed to the idea of university but I would rather take things slow and go with the flow once I’m out of high school. I know I can achieve great things in my life but my parents don’t believe in my at all.

What should I do?

I’m always at odds with my step daughters. How do I fix this?,"So for context, I have been with my bf for 5 years. I have 4 kids, he has two. For the most part everyone gets along very well, we’ve been pretty lucky in that regard. Where we seem to have the most trouble is my dynamic with his daughters, 13 and 9. In the beginning I bent over backwards to form a good relationship with them. At times I did things for them that I wouldn’t even do for my own kids. The thing is, they only talk to me when they want something and they are usually pretty ungrateful. Since we’ve been quarantined, I haven’t taken them to the mall or the trampoline park like I used to. And they don’t talk to me at all. When they aren’t with us, they live with mom and grandparents, who like to spoil them as much as possible. They admit to doing so. When they come here, I treat them the same as my kids. Which is to say, they should help out with chores and clean up after themselves. It usually starts fights when I try to get them to help out, and then they bring their mother into it. BF usually just does everything for them to try to avoid the issue, and he doesn’t really think they should do chores anyway. I am not willing to have my kids do all the work while those two just watch YouTube all day though. What am I supposed to do? These girls hate me right now because I asked them to clean their own bathroom. I’ve done it the last 50 times. And they are calling their mom who is calling my BF and shit talking me.

My brother is angry all the time,"We were brought up in a screaming household, our parents verbally and physically punished us for mistakes we made as kids. When I left for university I told my parents that they need to change and they slowly did (my parents genuinely didn't know how damaging the things they said were, but at least they were willing to change). My brother is 14 now, but he's become the one who is verbally and physically aggressive now. The door slamming and harmful words didn't reduce, it just comes from a different person now. He refuses to communicate, games for HOURS, neglects his responsibilities, and yells at the smallest things. We've literally gotten neighbor complaints on how often and disturbing those yellings are. His grades and tanking because he just doesn't do his homework or care about school, my mom's gotten physically hurt multiple times already and I don't know what to do. He blames everything on his upbringing and I totally concede that a part of it is because my parents were verbally abusive and whooped his ass quite often as kids, but he seems quite content to just blame our parents and let that excuse all his behaviors.

Son (17) may live in my basement and grow up to be a deadbeat bum his whole life!,"My 17 will be 18 in a matter of days.  He barely squeezed through and graduated high school this year.  He struggled through school but was never officially diagnosed with ADHD.  He is not motivated by doing well in school but he played football and was in marching band and other activities.  He is very popular and is surrounded by friends.  He is focused on his activities and on his friends but refuses to work or apply for college.  This whole summer has been going to play basketball during the day, coming home showers and going out with his friends (play video games at a friends house is what he tells me..) and comes home at 4am or 3am.  This is every night and every day.  He refused to honor the curfew I put in place (midnight).  I’ve asked him to get a job but he keeps on saying he is looking but no offers.  I don’t believe he is getting rejected, just not interested on working and so he doesn’t follow up.  All his friends work and have colleges lined up, they are good family kids.  My son has not worked any job through out high school, while his friends have tried multiple fast food and retail jobs.  My son has nothing going on except for the occasional money he makes selling stuff 2nd hand.

I have tried different ways to motivate him.  I explained about the future, i talked about work ethics and establishing that early and building resumes etc etc.  My brothers (his uncles) tried talking to him.  I am a single mom so his dad is not in his life.  I even bought him a car and told him he needs to get a job and pay it off.  I told him I borrowed the money from his grandma and she needs the money back.  Nothing.  The car died on him and he has it sitting on the sidewalk and won’t take the time to fix it (his friends are always around to pick him up).   I asked him to sell the car and make it his job to sell it.  Even though he buys and sells other stuff he hasn’t posted anything on the car...it’s been a month and nothing.

I don’t know what to do at this time.  He is never home and does not do anything with family or contribute to chores around the house.  He won’t even clean his room unless I blow up and take away his phone.  But with no college or job in the near future what do I do to light fire under him to get him to wake up and start acting responsibly.  I am so frustrated.

Question: My parents are wondering if my sister needs a phone,"I'm posting on behalf of my parents, who are confused in the matter and I am stuck in the middle. My sister is a junior in hs, and wants a phone. She had one before, but would spend about 10-12  hours on it a day sometimes, so my parents had to take it away so she would come out of her room after a whole day. She says she needs it for texting people for group projects (but I went to her same high school and never had a need for it ngl). Any thoughts? 

I told her that she can use google hangouts or another platform (and also money is tight bc of the pandemic and my parents say that ""not everyone has a phone...you can get one once you are more responsible and in senior year and once""). 

I don't want to be the asshole in any way, but she does yell at everyone if she doesn't get what she wants and I have to talk to her calmly to calm her down.",0,"Question: My parents are wondering if my sister needs a phone I'm posting on behalf of my parents, who are confused in the matter and I am stuck in the middle.

Teaching kids financial responsibility in these days of government checks.,"We have always taught our children to be responsible financially. To us that means working hard, living below your means, saving some money, donating some and having some to spend. Things have gone well up until recently. My youngest (18) had earned about $7500 and was saving up for a car and for college. Right before The lock down hit, he blew virtually every penny of it and really had no idea how he was going to pay for either. We help our kids with college, expenses, car, etc. but insist that they pay a portion as well. We find that them having “skin in the game” makes them much more responsible. He was working one day a week and when the place closed, he applied for an unemployment. The government backdated his claim and sent him $12,000. Evidently, he is due for more when they sign the new deal. He was making less than $100 a week and has no interest in returning to work because he is doing better without a job than he would do with a job. Much of what we have tried to teach him has been undermined by these checks and he is presently shopping for a car and calculating how much more money the government will send him. He is living like the supply of govt. money will never end, despite our cautions. While I’m happy for him that he’s getting a car, I’m also sad for him because he has been deprived of some really important life lessons regarding finances. How do you teach financial responsibility in these days of government checks which are bigger than what the salary would be if the kids were working?",0,"Teaching kids financial responsibility in these days of government checks.

How do i fix things with my niece (I'm one of her guardians),"Hello all, I know this is a lot to read but I am devastated and could really use your advice. I know I am not a full-on parent but my niece (13) has been living full time with my mom and I since January (her parents are going through a messy separation) even though she has spent half her life on and off with us. So I am pretty much her guardian along with my mom.

I cannot seem to build a good relationship with her. She seems to love me dearly and I love her dearly but the moment I do anything 'parent-like' she makes it in to a big deal. I noticed she gives me a particularly hard time to the point where her constant back talking and arguing has given me at least 1 minor panic attack and 1 major major major one where I screamed and blew up at her and I never recovered from this because she didn't recover from it, as it is scary to see an adult lose control like that. This was in February. I have aplogized and admitted how poorly I acted and that I, as an adult, should've had better control of my emotions. She is not over it and I understand. 

Yesterday she confessed that she gave me an intentionally hard time for years because when she was younger, she saw me yelling at my dad and she loves him (her grandpa) and wanted to make me suffer because of it. My dad is a horrible person, and it pains me that no one ever considers or remembers that I blew up at him because this piece of shit human decided he can insult me. My niece now knows how horrible my dad is as she overheard from other sources. I never told her. And I always regretted yelling at him with her within earshot and I tried for years and years to be better and to be the best I can be to her but because she hated me for saying mean things to her grandpa all those years ago, it was so frustrating. A few weeks ago she asked me if some of the horrible things she overheard from others about her grandpa was true and if I even knew about it, and I said yes (he cheated on my mom their entire married life, he used to beat her,  sabotaged her career, etc), I have never told her because a child didn't need to know those things and I encouraged her relationship with her grandpa as I know she loves him. So i guess this is why she confessed she was intentionally mean to me. It broke my heart because all these years I've tried to make it right that she saw me yelling at him and all i ended up with is a panic attack that once again traumatised her (the one in February).

After the panic attack I tried taking care of my mental health and I've done wonderfully. But no matter what i do, my niece still cannot stop thinking of me as a stupid person. She has no respect for me and has said as much. She speaks to me as if I am a kid and I can't even scold her for anything no matter how gently I do it without her being massively offended. One day I said: hun, you gotta be a little more organized with your school work (she mentioned three times in that past week: oh no, I forgot to do this.. it's due in 2 hrs, or similar). Did not go over well. 

No matter how hard I try, I always screw up and no matter what little thing I say or do, it is always a problem. I am considering not trying anymore and just leaving her alone for my mom to care for solely, due to no fault of my niece (I think she is wonderful and I love her with all my heart). She spent an hr yesterday saying all the things I do wrong to her and some of them are baffling to me like: u check in with my schoolwork and I am not used to anyone caring about me and my school work like that so leave me alone. I have always cared for her school work. I taught her to read and to count when she was little. 

I'm exhausted and I hate myself now. What do i do? I know I have done shit things like yelling at her grandpa with her in ear shot, having a panic attack, being overly harsh with her studies when she was younger (I saw no one else taking on the role and because she was already intent on being mean to me then due to her hating me for speaking harshly to her grandpa, it was a trying time for both of us), trying to discipline her when she was younger (I have given her 5 timeouts in her whole life and only when she was younger and then I just gave up, the only punishment she has ever received, and yesterday she told me how resentful she was and she spoke as if I was this mean, unfair monster who harmed her by giving her the cruel and unusual punishment of time outs - they never lasted more than 10 minutes). 

I dedicate my life to being the best aunty and guardian I can be and to know I've failed so spectacularly and miserably despite my best efforts is heartbreaking and soul crushing because this child deserves the best and I'm not it. I question every thing I say and do now. I'm in bed crying and praying I didn't screw her up permanently.",0,"How do i fix things with my niece (I'm one of her guardians) Hello all, I know this is a lot to read but I am devastated and could really use your advice.

Daughter is throwing a fit over her outfit for my wedding.,"Her dad and I never got to have a wedding ceremony.  In fact we have never actually been legally married.  But I lost my insurance and needed to get on his so we are having to legally do it finally after all these years.

We have no friends or family and are on a budget so we are getting married in an acquaintance’s garden and I’ll be wearing a $20 dress, then back home for homemade cupcakes.  We don’t even know enough people to have two witnesses so the owner of the garden is going to come sign and the officiant is bringing his fiancé as the other witness.  We have nobody taking pictures and it will be a ten minute ceremony.

Obviously this is nowhere near the wedding I always dreamed of but I’m making peace with it.  It is what it is.

Today our fourteen year old daughter showed the family a picture of her chosen outfit.  I had told the kids this wasn’t a formal affair and to be comfortable.  Her middle of the summer,  outdoors hot as balls wedding outfit of choice was a black Panic at the Disco tee shirt, skin tight Lycra miniskirt that ties up the side with grommets (borrowed from a friend) that barely covers her butt, fishnet pantyhose and a pair of my heels that are a bit tall for a kid in my opinion.  She also dyed her hair two shades of neon pink.  There are so many pieces of this outfit I am fine with.  Some of the pieces I dislike but have chosen my battles.  But all together it is simply not appropriate.  

Her eighteen year old brother begged her to “just once be thoughtful and a team player” and to choose something nicer.  His issue wasn’t the appropriateness but what he perceived to be a lack of care, thoughtfulness and consideration it seemed.  We are always battling over something and he
thinks she knew this outfit was going to be an issue.  

He’s wearing a button up and jeans.  He tends towards the goth look fairly often but chose to eschew that for the day.  Our other daughter is wearing a sundress and our other son a pair of jean shorts and a polo.

She just went nuclear on the family when I asked her to pick a different skirt.  The rest could stay I said.  That was a huge compromise for me.  She started screaming at us and then the littler siblings got upset and started crying and screaming.  Her older brother just got irritated.

I have been parenting nonstop without a break for eighteen years, including a severely ill child who has spent his life in and out of the hospital.  No honeymoon, no days off, nothing.  The past year has been horrible for me...my mother died, etc.  My daughter even made the whole family miss Christmas (that is a long long story).  It has been one trial after another.  

Ten minutes for me to be the focus is all I asked.  Not even the whole day.  Not even a night away.  

She’s in therapy and her therapist doesn’t know what to do with her.  (This is not the first.) I am actually afraid she is a sociopath.  She has been “diagnosed” as lacking empathy and also with pathological lying.  She holds us hostage every day.  We can’t even have a family meal without it going south.

I just want one day.  One nice day for me.  And I feel selfish even wanting that much.  I just feel that if I can put aside MY hopes and dreams and be content with what I’m getting for a wedding day surely she can be okay with changing her skirt.  Just one accommodation just once?

It’s too late to get in touch with her therapist today or in time for the wedding.

Considering a job that would have me move crosscountry away from my kids. Need advice pls,"Hello everyone.  I (M52) live in Boston, MA.  I have two teenage kids, my daughter is 15 (D15) and my son is 14 (S14).  The kids live with their mother (B44) in CT, they visit me every two weeks for the weekend (I drive to get them), and sometimes extended times (think X\_mas and holidays).  Their mother and I have a cordial relationship and agree on co-parenting styles.  Legally, we have joint custody.  She is an ok mother, but could be a lot better.

I work in scientific field (analytical chemistry) and have over 20 years experience.  The next step in my career should be heading up an analytical lab.  For several reasons, I am very unhappy at my current job, however, it is steady and safe.  I can be unhappy and keep going.  The Boston area is a good area to be for biotech jobs

in the before times (around Feb 2020)  I was approached by a recruiter about a job in San Diego, CA.  I decided to consider it and give it my all while pursuing it, to make the decision later on.  I finally had a Zoom interview July 14.  I gave a 45 minute technical seminar of my accomplishments, followed by 5 hours of 1:1 interviews with the team.  this was honestly the best interview seminar I have ever given.  Felt really good about it, the team and I clicked really well.  Things are moving slowly, but they want to schedule an onsite interview when conditions allow it.  All signs point to them making an offer at some point.  This does look like my dream job.

&amp;#x200B;

**This is the hard part:  the only thing holding me here is the kids.  I am very hesitant to move to the West Coast and far from them.  Right now, I am a two hour drive away from them, in case they need me, I go to parent teacher conferences, whatever.  I am planning to talk to them about the possibility and seeing how they feel about it.**

Overall I would appreciate some advice.  If I move to CA, I would come visit at least every two months.  Some things to point out:

1) I am from Central America and my parents sent me to this country when I was 13.  I always have resented them for this as I felt abandoned.  Since they will still live with their mom, this case is not so bad

2) I once took a job away form them in 2014.  It was hard.  I was away for 8 months, I would visit monthly and stay at an extended hotel.

3) With COVID19 travel will be iffy at best for the foreseeable future

"Question: What are best practices for dealing with sullen, apathetic teenagers?","My kids, ages 14, 14, and 16, are great kids. I love them with all my heart.

Should I buy me son a newer car or a beater?,"My son is 16 and about to get his license. We want to get him a car so once life has some normalcy he can drive himself to and from band practices and he wants to get a job to pay for his gas and insurance. Here is where I am torn. Should we spend about $10k-12 and get him a newer car that has all the safety features, won't break down constantly and last him through college or should we spend only a few thousand to get him a beater since he is a new driver and might bang it up a little? He is responsible with his stuff. He has never broken a phone or a game controller and he does understand the responsibility and costs associated with a car. I know we can spend a little money to the beater car and add a backup camera and Bluetooth that I want him to have but I also want to make sure if he does get in a bad accident the car has good safety features. I was severely rear ended a few years ago and because I was in a newer car it saved my life and I walked away.",0,"Should I buy me son a newer car or a beater? My son is and about to get his license.

Teenager is mad I'm not having an abortion.,"So this is a bit complex, hang in there. My husband ""C"" is 17 years older than his younger brother. He is 35 and his brother ""S"" is 16  I won't go into all the details of how we ended up taking custody of his brother but it's a long and sad story. ""S"" grew up basically an only child even though technically he has seven siblings. We have always had some sort of relationship with ""S"" but he came to live with us officially about two years ago. He has been doing really well and is generally happy, which take my word for it, is a miracle in of itself. When we brought him here we put him in the basement so he could have his own room and living space away from everyone else. It's nice because he can get away whenever he wants due to the fact that I have two toddlers and toddlers can make anyone crazy. 

I have a 4 yo and 2 yo and as many of you know it's a fight everyday to keep them on track. ""S"" pretty much stays to himself during the day and doesn't have much to do with the kids although he will interact with them on occasion. He has even been known to have pillow fights with them but like any teenager, he isn't ecstatic about little kids the majority of the time. Meanwhile, my two toddlers adore him. 

Last week I found out I was pregnant which was unexpected but not unanticipated because I have horrid reactions to birth control and I'm not on any. We weren't exactly wanting another child right now but ""C"" and I have come to terms with it and of course are happy to have another little one although we both agree the house will be full and we will both be fixed when this one is born. 

Needless to say, ""S"" is not happy. He's tried to convince me to get an abortion. he's tried to convince me to give my child away and he's mentioned selling my child. I'm not sure where he thinks I would do such a thing or more importantly why I would want to. He doesn't seem to understand why I want to keep my child as he thinks that it's too much money and he doesn't want to deal with anymore kids in the house (even though he only sees them on occasion when he's not working or playing fortnite). 

I remember being a teenager and not liking kids and I get it to a certain extent but it makes me sad that he is going to act this way. We spend lots of time together and I love him like my own son although the counselor describes us more as a sister / brother relationship. He calls me sis and I call him bro. It's hard for me and I feel sad but I certainly would not get rid of my child over a teenage tantrum. 

Tonight he stopped watching a movie with me because he said he was disappointed.  I'm not sure if there is something I can do to help the situation. I feel guilty when I know I shouldn't and that pisses me off to be quite frank. It's taking away some of my happiness about the whole thing when really it was hard to get happy over such an unexpected surprise to begin with.

Tips for dealing with victimhood from teenager.,"The title sounds rude, and it isn't my intention, but it is the subject I need advice with. 

Our child, 16 years old, has been with us for 2.5 years. She's made growth inany areas, but something I have a problem with is how to stay empathetic towards her past. My wife experienced a horrible childhood in foster care for nearly 10 years, and so we have an idea where she's coming from. The phrase i hear too much from our kid is ""Well I'm sorry I have _____ from [past event in foster care/birth mom]"" when we're in a disagreement about something. It also comes in the form of, for lack of a better term, oversensitivity towards things. Example is that we asked our kid to do some dishes (a chore they have everyday) and it always gets forgotten about. So I said before leaving ""Can you do some dishes? You know it should have been done earlier. The ""I'm sorry I..."" phrase came out. Her time in foster care, according to her, damaged her and she suffers from migraines that come about from heat and dishes, which wouldve been much easier to do in the morning if heat is an issue, and it resulted in a blow up at us. My wife knows what foster care can be like, she has told me of past horrors, but I can't feel empathetic anymore. I've tried listening, but it's like they like having an issue. I sound jaded, I know, but I don't want to not feel bad for her. Her past is something I know she'll be dealing with for awhile, but I don't want her to be a victim towards everything.",0,"Tips for dealing with victimhood from teenager.

Phasing out a toxic friend,"Daughter is 13.5 years of age.  She is a good kid but she has a ""best friend"" we will call her Ava that is becoming a very negative influence on her.  She is crying all the time, she is obsessed with pleasing this friend, and she started treating us with a lot of disrespect when things with Ava aren't going well.  Ava seems to get very angry when she doesn't get her way and takes it out on our daughter emotionally which is affecting her self-esteem and mood.  Our daughter has other acquaintances but no other really close friends.  We have instituted limits on her electronics to keep her from being on FaceTime and text with Ava 24/7.  We have tried discussing with our daughter that she needs to take a break from Ava and her therapist has also told her she needs to take a break.

We need to phase out this friend and try to get our daughter to embrace more healthy friendships.  Do you all have any advice on how we can accomplish this?  We have been trying to encourage her to spend more time with other friends but it isn't working out so well.  Since COVID happened this friendship has take a BIG slide downhill and we are extremely concerned.

Parents: Beware of a new online harassment trend (I experienced firsthand today),"Warning for parents (and everyone really)

Last week my 15yo daughter told me someone she had been talking to online on Discord had threatened to “SWAT” her if she didn’t send him nudes. She told him no and then told me about it. I told her to block him and reassured her that the SWAT team wouldn’t just show up at our house because someone called them and lied about something. I called our local LVMPD substation and explained the story. We were fairly certain the guy lives in the UK, but we wanted to make a report if needed. We were told that since there was no specific threat and she had already blocked the guy that there wasn’t anything else to be done. 

Today, my SO came out of the bedroom and said, “Did you hear that? I think the police are calling someone out of their home. I heard them down the street but couldn’t see anything. I’m going to check it out.” Well, I’m a true crime junkie, so I put on my flip flops and headed out after him. My daughter followed. As soon as my SO got to the bottom of our walkway, we saw at least ten police cars at the end of our cul-de-sac and police officers with assault rifles pointed at us. We had no idea what was going on, but they quickly called my SO by his shirt color and told him to walk toward them with his hands up. Then they called me out by name and told me to do the same. At this point, my daughter wasn’t visible to them, so I told her to go back inside. 

We were cuffed at the end of our street, as we both were so confused, looking at each other and at the police, completely unaware of what was going on. They then called my children out of the house. My poor 13yo son had to walk down the street with no shoes, burning his feet on the pavement, wearing nothing but some underwear that were also too small. We were all handcuffed. My children and I were placed in a car to stay cool. My SO was not. 

They asked us continually who else was in the house, and we continually told them no one. They eventually cleared the home and only after that were we told what was going on. Someone (obviously the guy who had threatened to SWAT my daughter) called the police and said that someone had been shot inside our home. 

Now I know that “SWATTING” really is a thing and I know how it feels to be completely innocent and fear for your lives. Things could have gone much differently. What if we hadn’t gone outside to check out the commotion? What if they had broken down our door? (We are legal gun owners). What if my SO and I weren’t home and only my children were home?

"I don’t want my daughter to get tattooed young, but I did the same thing","My family will be attending a funeral in another country next month. Recently, my 16 y/o daughter asked me if I would be okay with her getting a tattoo while we’re there because the parlors tend to be more relaxed about age.

When I was around her age I lived in a town very close to the border, and I used to drive there to get tattooed. I have four large pieces on my upper arm from this, and her dad and I have both pretty heavily tattooed now.

I don’t have a problem when with her doing what she wants when she turns 18, but it just seems too soon right now. Part of the reason I was able to severely modify my body at such a young age is because my parents were very absent. 

I told her no, it’s better to just wait till you’re 18, and she brought up how I had gotten tattoos before I was that age.

How not to ruin your relationship with your teenage kids,"I may not be a parent, but I can speak from the teenager point of view and the reason I am making this post is because my relationship with my mom is quite strained, anyway, here are some tips: 

- don’t make fun of what they like: let’s say your kid likes something, don’t make fun of them, don’t say things like: you like this? Why? (In a disapproving tone) that won’t make the kid feel good, and it will ensure they won’t open up to you 

- don’t make negative comments on the way they dress: teens express themselves through their clothes and choice of style, don’t say things like: “you look like a bum”, “don’t wear this, you look like shit”. That won’t make your kids feel good. 

- spend time with them one on one: my mom never did this with me and it sucks, because I have heard girls my age y’all about all the fun times they have with their moms and it stings knowing I didn’t/don’t have that. Please have 1:1 quality time together, your teens will remember that. 

Don’t be too critical: obviously teens need guidance, but being too critical will damage them, and let’s be real here, no one wants to be around people that criticize too much. 

Don’t compare your kids to other people: because let’s be honest here, what will you accomplish, what’s the point of comparing kids to others. And think about it this way, you wouldn’t want to be compared to other people, so how do you think your teens feel? Teens can compare you to others, and trust me, it hurts. 

Pick your battles: obviously fighting is inevitable, but parents are notorious for picking weird hills to die on. Before you do, think to yourself: it is worth it? Is this the hill I’m willing to die on? 

Don’t try to be their friend all the time: it’s not stable, if you act like their friend more than a parent sometimes, they will get mixed messages. 

Don’t forget what it was like being a teenager: remember, you guys were teenagers at one point, so you have an idea what teens are like. 

Don’t make teens feel like talking to them is a chore: teens notice that, and it hurts. Also, make them feel like they are important, with my mother, she talks on the phone a lot, so that made me feel like I am not important, don’t make your kids feel like that. 

These are just a few I can think of, feel free to add more, and remember, the teen years won’t last forever, adolescence is hard, but with guidance and stability, they will be ok!",0,"How not to ruin your relationship with your teenage kids I may not be a parent, but I can speak from the teenager point of view and the reason I am making this post is because my relationship with my mom is quite strained, anyway, here are some tips:   - don’t make fun of what they like: let’s say your kid likes something, don’t make fun of them, don’t say things like: you like this?

Don’t compare your kids to other people: because let’s be honest here, what will you accomplish, what’s the point of comparing kids to others. And think about it this way, you wouldn’t want to be compared to other people, so how do you think your teens feel? Teens can compare you to others, and trust me, it hurts.   Pick your battles: obviously fighting is inevitable, but parents are notorious for picking weird hills to die on. Before you do, think to yourself: it is worth it? Is this the hill I’m willing to die on?   Don’t try to be their friend all the time: it’s not stable, if you act like their friend more than a parent sometimes, they will get mixed messages.   Don’t forget what it was like being a teenager: remember, you guys were teenagers at one point, so you have an idea what teens are like.   Don’t make teens feel like talking to them is a chore: teens notice that, and it hurts. Also, make them feel like they are important, with my mother, she talks on the phone a lot, so that made me feel like I am not important, don’t make your kids feel like that.   These are just a few I can think of, feel free to add more, and remember, the teen years won’t last forever, adolescence is hard, but with guidance and stability, they will be ok!",56,10,2414,451,Teenager 13-19 Years
Important things not taught in US public schools but we should teach our teenage kids?,"I found this sex consent video information is very valuable. https://youtu.be/oQbei5JGiT8

My son wants to move out???,"My 15 year old son recently got in trouble. He was drinking with a couple other 16 year old boys. I lost my shit...This was our first ""real"" act of rebellion (or experimenting) or whatever it was.

His father lives an hour or so away and he sees him every other weekend- as has been the arrangement since son was 5 years old. I think his Dad ""under-reacted"" to the whole drinking issue.  

My son came home to me on Sunday night and is already talking about and asking about moving in with his Father.  His Dad isn't the worst person in the world. But he hasn't really ever ""Parented"". He doesn't deal with school, friends, behavior or anything outside of what might come up within 4 days a month he has him (We call him a Disney Dad). So I know it is mainly because Dad doesn't seem as mad as I am, or there aren't the consequences at Dads house that we have in place here.

There is no “I” in Hannah," by [Vitaliy Katsenelson](https://contrarianedge.com/the-jet-lag-series-there-is-no-i-in-hannah-but-there-are-two-in-vitaliy/)

(you can listen to it [here](http://investor.fm/the-jet-lag-series-there-is-no-i-in-hannah-but-there-are-two-in-vitaliy-ep-61))

February 2020

I have to tell you, I am shocked by the maturity of my 14-year-old daughter, Hannah (and the immaturity of her father).

Last summer Hannah started playing volleyball. She really fell in love with the game. She went to volleyball camp and joined a volleyball league in September. At first, Hannah played on a team for 14-year-old’s. She was one of the best players. Her coach told her that he wanted to make her a team captain. Then the program director noticed Hannah’s play and told me that Hannah had “good hands” and suggested that we transfer her to a more advanced team of 15-year-olds (Hannah just turned 14). I instantly started calling her “good hands Hannah.”

My wife and I hesitated a little, because we weren’t sure if it would be better for Hannah to be the best player on a weak team or a weaker player on a better team. (Malcom Gladwell’s books would suggest the former.) But Hannah told us that she really wanted to get better and it would help her to be on a stronger team. So she joined the more advanced team. This was a month ago.

Yesterday, Hannah and I got up at 6 in the morning to drive to a tournament that was an hour away in Colorado Springs. Hannah’s team played four other teams. Each game has two or three sets. Hannah stood on the sidelines for all the games and did not touch the ball even once.

I was really upset, for two reasons. First, I was thinking, what was the point of our using our Sunday to drive 65 miles and spend eight hours in a very noisy arena (you don’t know what loud means until you hear 200 teenage girls scream non-stop), just to see Hannah’s teammates play and Hannah sit on the sidelines. So, if I am honest with myself, this reason was more about me. We could have been skiing instead or doing something else fun.

The second reason was the one that was really breaking my heart. I saw Hannah on the sidelines while the other girls played, and I felt that she must feel like a second-hand citizen. But Hannah smiled throughout and cheered and high-fived her teammates when they scored. I looked at her and thought, she must feel miserable inside. Her pain must be my pain times a hundred.

Hannah’s team won every single game. The team moved on to a higher division. At the end every player got a victory pin. They took a group picture. Hannah was incredibly excited and happy. Her father… not so much.

When we got in the car to drive back, I asked her if she wanted me to talk to the program director about going back to the old team. Hannah said (I am writing this almost verbatim), “Dad, absolutely not. Being part of the team is not just about playing in the tournaments. It is participating in the practices. This was a very important tournament where we had the chance to move up to the next division. If I were my coach, I wouldn’t have played me, either. I am new to the team. She doesn’t know me well yet. Also, I am not as good as other girls on the team. They’ve played for years; I started less than six months ago. I learned so much watching the games from the sidelines. I could see the mistakes of the other girls and learn from them. I learned a lot today. I know where I need to improve. I need to work harder. Dad, I also got a victory pin!”

I said “Well, maybe we should go skiing during tournaments when they don’t play you. What’s the point of us being there?” Hannah retorted, “You don’t understand! If I don’t show up, then who is going to give them emotional support? When I’m on the sidelines, I’m cheering them on. I’m helping them. My team won! This is very important. I am part of the team.”

I was speechless. We drove for two minutes in silence. I had thought the smile I saw on Hannah’s face during the tournament was sitting on top of giant pain. I could not have been more wrong. She was happy for her team. She felt like she was part of something bigger than her.

My brother Alex called me and asked if Hannah got to play. (I had called him a few times during the tournament, complaining about Hannah not playing). I told him what she told me. I said, she is so much smarter and more mature than her father. My 14-year-old daughter showed me what it means to be part of a team. I have no idea if Hannah will be playing volleyball a year from now (I hope she will), but I know she is prepared for the life ahead of her. She’ll be a great asset to any company or organization she decides to start or join.

Ten years ago I would have looked at spending a full day at these tournaments as a chore. Driving an hour each way. Did I mention 200 teenage girls screaming? There are so many other things I could be doing. But awhile back I realized that there is a finality to everything in life and especially to kids being … well, kids. This changed my perspective on life. Instead of looking at driving my daughter to tournaments as an obligation and feeling victimized for being forced to do it, I *choose* to do it. And I really, honestly look forward to doing it. As we drive, Hannah and I listen to music and podcasts, and we talk. We go to lunch. We spend time together.

**Post-Script: BC (Before Coronavirus)**

P.S. I wrote this article in early February. I was jet-lagged from my trip to Europe, but I intentionally stretched this jet lag from a day or two into a week and used it as a creativity boost to write the series of articles I call the Jet Lag Series.

As I reread it today, it feels like I wrote it in a different era – in the BC (before coronavirus) era. Part of me is missing the normalcy of BC – seeing my relatives, my friends, going out to concerts and restaurants. I’d be delighted to drive Hannah to volleyball practice, or even to drive her 65 miles to a volleyball tournament packed with screaming teenage girls.

We tend to appreciate what we have only when it is taken away from us. In what I am about to say, I am going paper over the fact that people are sick and dying and that millions have (temporarily) lost their jobs. But a supermajority of people have been impacted by COVID-19 in a more superficial way – we are locked down with our loved ones at home.

This is now how I *choose* to look at the situation. Let me tell you a story. Ten years ago or so, my family – my wife and I, the kids, and my aunt – were driving through a park. I was driving my wife’s minivan and didn’t notice that we were low on gas and … we ran out of gas. The car stopped dead in the middle of a large state park. My wife was initially upset that we were stuck in the middle of nowhere. The normal me would have been upset, too. But the parent in me thought, “What would my father say and do?” I said to my family, “Think about it: If we drove through the park and nothing happened, it would have been just another time that we drove from point A to point B. Now we have a little adventure that we’ll remember. Our lives are not threatened; we are all safe. Let’s just make the best of it.”

This story lacks drama and suffering (thank god). We simply called my father and asked him to bring us some gasoline. In the meantime, we played soccer and walked in the beautiful park. An hour later my father brought us the gas.

My kids and I filed this little misadventure as a happy memory of when we ran out of gas in the park and did fun things. My wife put it into the mental file of when I forgot to check if we had enough gas in our (her) car before we started driving.

For most (not all) of us, the situation today is not much different from this drive we had in the park. We have an opportunity to turn it into a happy future memory. Embrace it. We cannot change what we are going through today, but we can change how we look at it.

Until last Friday I worked out of my office. My kids begged me to work from home. I stopped going to the office, and I am so glad I did. But not for health reasons (there is only one other person in the office, everyone else is working remotely).

I have never worked harder in my life than I have over the last month. I am doing research nonstop, building models, launching a new product (the [All-Terrain Dividend Portfolio](https://contrarianedge.com/the-all-terrain-dividend-portfolio/)), talking on the phone to my investment (friends) network, writing weekly letters to clients. Now that I’m at home, I try proactively to take time to do something with the family here and there. Mia Sarah sneaks into my office with Connect Four and tells me “I’ll beat you,” and we play a few sets. We all go for 15-minute bike ride, have lunch and dinner together outside, or go for a walk. I get a lot of work done but still spend time with the people that matter the most to me.

Our life is anything but normal, but other than the real pain others are going through, and despite my normal life being put on hold, I wouldn’t change a thing. I am embracing this experience. If not for coronavirus, ten years from now it would have been just another March and April in 2020. For now, and despite the real hardship many are experiencing, we have the opportunity to create happy memories that we will look back on when we transition to life AC (after coronavirus).",0,"There is no “I” in Hannah  by [Vitaliy Katsenelson](https://contrarianedge.com/the-jet-lag-series-there-is-no-i-in-hannah-but-there-are-two-in-vitaliy/)  (you can listen to it [here](http://investor.fm/the-jet-lag-series-there-is-no-i-in-hannah-but-there-are-two-in-vitaliy-ep-61))  February 2020  I have to tell you, I am shocked by the maturity of my 14-year-old daughter, Hannah (and the immaturity of her father).  Last summer Hannah started playing volleyball. She really fell in love with the game. She went to volleyball camp and joined a volleyball league in September. At first, Hannah played on a team for 14-year-old’s. She was one of the best players. Her coach told her that he wanted to make her a team captain. Then the program director noticed Hannah’s play and told me that Hannah had “good hands” and suggested that we transfer her to a more advanced team of 15-year-olds (Hannah just turned 14). I instantly started calling her “good hands Hannah.”  My wife and I hesitated a little, because we weren’t sure if it would be better for Hannah to be the best player on a weak team or a weaker player on a better team. (Malcom Gladwell’s books would suggest the former.) But Hannah told us that she really wanted to get better and it would help her to be on a stronger team. So she joined the more advanced team. This was a month ago.  Yesterday, Hannah and I got up at in the morning to drive to a tournament that was an hour away in Colorado Springs. Hannah’s team played four other teams. Each game has two or three sets. Hannah stood on the sidelines for all the games and did not touch the ball even once.  I was really upset, for two reasons. First, I was thinking, what was the point of our using our Sunday to drive miles and spend eight hours in a very noisy arena (you don’t know what loud means until you hear teenage girls scream non-stop), just to see Hannah’s teammates play and Hannah sit on the sidelines. So, if I am honest with myself, this reason was more about me. We could have been skiing instead or doing something else fun.  The second reason was the one that was really breaking my heart. I saw Hannah on the sidelines while the other girls played, and I felt that she must feel like a second-hand citizen. But Hannah smiled throughout and cheered and high-fived her teammates when they scored. I looked at her and thought, she must feel miserable inside. Her pain must be my pain times a hundred.  Hannah’s team won every single game. The team moved on to a higher division. At the end every player got a victory pin. They took a group picture. Hannah was incredibly excited and happy. Her father… not so much.  When we got in the car to drive back, I asked her if she wanted me to talk to the program director about going back to the old team. Hannah said (I am writing this almost verbatim), “Dad, absolutely not. Being part of the team is not just about playing in the tournaments. It is participating in the practices. This was a very important tournament where we had the chance to move up to the next division. If I were my coach, I wouldn’t have played me, either. I am new to the team. She doesn’t know me well yet. Also, I am not as good as other girls on the team. They’ve played for years; I started less than six months ago. I learned so much watching the games from the sidelines. I could see the mistakes of the other girls and learn from them. I learned a lot today. I know where I need to improve. I need to work harder. Dad, I also got a victory pin!”  I said “Well, maybe we should go skiing during tournaments when they don’t play you. What’s the point of us being there?” Hannah retorted, “You don’t understand! If I don’t show up, then who is going to give them emotional support? When I’m on the sidelines, I’m cheering them on. I’m helping them. My team won! This is very important. I am part of the team.”  I was speechless. We drove for two minutes in silence. I had thought the smile I saw on Hannah’s face during the tournament was sitting on top of giant pain. I could not have been more wrong. She was happy for her team. She felt like she was part of something bigger than her.  My brother Alex called me and asked if Hannah got to play. (I had called him a few times during the tournament, complaining about Hannah not playing). I told him what she told me. I said, she is so much smarter and more mature than her father. My 14-year-old daughter showed me what it means to be part of a team. I have no idea if Hannah will be playing volleyball a year from now (I hope she will), but I know she is prepared for the life ahead of her. She’ll be a great asset to any company or organization she decides to start or join.  Ten years ago I would have looked at spending a full day at these tournaments as a chore. Driving an hour each way. Did I mention teenage girls screaming? There are so many other things I could be doing. But awhile back I realized that there is a finality to everything in life and especially to kids being … well, kids. This changed my perspective on life. Instead of looking at driving my daughter to tournaments as an obligation and feeling victimized for being forced to do it, I *choose* to do it. And I really, honestly look forward to doing it. As we drive, Hannah and I listen to music and podcasts, and we talk. We go to lunch. We spend time together.  **Post-Script: BC (Before Coronavirus)**  P.S. I wrote this article in early February.

"My child is trying to skip custody-ordered visits with me because it is ""too hot"". Help?","I have primary custody of our daughter. Never married. My ex and I have had this custody agreement since she was 2.

There has been a massive heat wave in PA. Dad keeps his AC on 65 at all times (per child). 

I have just been laid from 2 jobs in one month. I am trying to save some money since I don't know when the next job will come around and am actively applying. This includes keeping the AC on a setting of 70.

My ex texted me this weekend and said our child does not want to come over because it is ""too hot"" in her room for her to sleep. He said he can keep her for my 5 day custody visit. I have her every Friday night through Wednesday night and every other weekend.

Her room does not go above 70. I found that she has been opening her window every night. She wakes up at 11am-12pm meaning the room is at 90 degrees by then and my AC is blowing out the window. Hence, the hot room. She is 15 and I have explained to her that hot day at noon + open window = hot room and she looks at me like I am insane. Her father thinks I don't have the AC on and am lying.

Today was my MILs bday and the family was over. Including nieces older/cool friends from down the road. At first my son was all, ""Good, I can get her her stuffed doggy back!""

Then followed a bit of a rant/lecture about how even some grownups have toutous and it's really not that big a deal, but if it embarrasses her, he'll claim it as his own if they see it/tease.

Teenager and manipulative mother,"I'm a stepmom to a wonderful almost 17 year old girl (G) and am struggling with how to help (if I even can) her deal with and recognize her mom's manipulation. Long story short, her mom has always engaged in some of the classic manipulative behaviors - fluid and unclear boundaries (asking her to keep secrets and be her mom's 'protector' at a very young age), unpredictable emotional responses (something is fine one day, terrible the next), use of guilt (how could you do this to me), moving the goalposts (of course you can do that, until the day of and then all of the sudden there's a reason you can't), etc, etc. Throughout her younger years, G has been very defensive of her mom and we have been careful not to challenge that relationship or say negative things about her mom, even though we have been pretty concerned.

My concern at the moment is that now this appears to have moved to financial manipulation as well.  There are other examples of her mom basically taking just G's money - of course with 'reasons' that make sense to a 16 year old but anyone else can see through - but here is the most recent. Her mom had an old Chevy truck that was sitting in a shed not running. Several years ago, she told G that if she 'fixed up' the truck, it would be hers. G spent the next two years working with her stepdad, who fixes cars, getting the truck in running order. Although her stepdad primarily did the work, G bought all the parts with her own money from working as a waitress. They mostly got the parts from the junkyard, so it was certainly less expensive then it otherwise would have been, but I believe G has put about $700 to $1k into that truck. Now, it runs great and is a pretty nice truck, and all of the sudden her mom told her that it was never G's truck and that she (mom) is going to trade the truck in on something new for herself. 

I don't have a problem with kids being asked to pay for vehicles. In fact, when I heard the plan I thought it was great. Nothing like paying for it and working on it yourself to help you learn about vehicle ownership! But I'm disgusted that her mother would just invalidate all the work and money her daughter put into it and take it for herself now that it's worth more and driveable. I think G recognizes to some degree that what her mom is doing isn't ok, but because of the manipulation and gaslighting her mom has done to her all her life, not to mention only being 16, she just doesn't quite get it. 

After learning of her mother's plan, her Dad and I told her that we didn't think she should put any more money into that truck and that we would help her get her own vehicle. When she told her mom that she wanted to get her own, her mom then countered it with a bunch of reasons why she shouldn't (she'll want to get a new vehicle when she moves to college, so why get one now; her stepdad won't work on the truck if she gets her own), and then offered to sell G their F-250 diesel truck for $2k. Which G is tempted by because she's 16 and loves big loud trucks. But of course, so expensive for a broke highschooler to drive (what parent thinks that's a good idea?) and anyway, we know that this offer is just about control. If G 'bought' that truck, what will stop her mom from just moving the goalposts again? 

We gently explained to her that the F-250 is not a good financial move for her and she seemed to agree, so hopefully she won't go that direction. But I really want to tell her to never enter into any kind of financial agreement with her mother again, because her mom won't hold up her end of the bargain. But I feel terrible for G - it can't be easy to recognize that your own mother is using and manipulating you. Any suggestions for how to gently help her figure this out? Or do we keep doing what we're doing and just make sure we are there for her when (if) she finally figures it out for herself?",0,"Teenager and manipulative mother I'm a stepmom to a wonderful almost year old girl (G) and am struggling with how to help (if I even can) her deal with and recognize her mom's manipulation. Long story short, her mom has always engaged in some of the classic manipulative behaviors - fluid and unclear boundaries (asking her to keep secrets and be her mom's 'protector' at a very young age), unpredictable emotional responses (something is fine one day, terrible the next), use of guilt (how could you do this to me), moving the goalposts (of course you can do that, until the day of and then all of the sudden there's a reason you can't), etc, etc. Throughout her younger years, G has been very defensive of her mom and we have been careful not to challenge that relationship or say negative things about her mom, even though we have been pretty concerned.  My concern at the moment is that now this appears to have moved to financial manipulation as well.  There are other examples of her mom basically taking just G's money - of course with 'reasons' that make sense to a year old but anyone else can see through - but here is the most recent. Her mom had an old Chevy truck that was sitting in a shed not running. Several years ago, she told G that if she 'fixed up' the truck, it would be hers.

My 17 year old has a high class mindset,"My son wants everything new or he'd rather wear the same thing until it rots. I have no shame shopping at goodwill and other thrift stores because I am on a budget. He wants his budget higher at a retail store. It's hard to reason with him and it would be a shame if I bought his brother (9) and sister (16) clothes and he's wearing a faded name brand shirt. The part that hurts my feelings is when our car broke down. I rode the city bus for months until I could afford another one. After getting it, he refused to ride in the car because it's old. He would rather stay home than to be caught inside it. If he keeps this mindset, he's going to have hardships unless he plans to work for the rest of his life to get all the lavish things. I missed the mark somewhere because everyone is humble except him.

Edit: thank you everyone for your opinion. I know a lot of people are saying that I should stop enabling and some are giving me the impression that I'm weak. I'll give you a little background so that you can understand my personality. I acted like him as a teenager because I was spoiled a lot. My parent's reaction was to put me out in the streets at 17 and I was homeless for a while until I got an apartment. I learned by force to humble myself. My son is that same age and I refuse to do him the same way. Yes, it's frustrating, but please don't view me as stupid or weak. Yes, the tables have turned on me and I'm in the same position as my parents. The truth hurts, but I'm taking it personally when some responses are a little harsh on me. I can either be aggressive with his behavior or be firm. I view myself as a very strong individual, so his issue just shows me that he is well taken care of but needs to learn how to manage his priorities. He's still young even if some view him like a young adult once he's 18 in a few months.",0,"My year old has a high class mindset My son wants everything new or he'd rather wear the same thing until it rots.

I don’t know how to help my son,"My son, 14, is the smallest kid in his class. By quite a bit in fact. We live in a very small town of about 1800 people. Recently he decided to stop going out for sports because he just rides the bench. Even though he hustles his ass off he’s not very good. Also recently, his best friend “dumped” him and has a new best friend. Due to both of these, he has basically no friends (COVID didn’t help either.) I’ve tried and tried to encourage him to “put himself out there” and reach out to kids and ask if they want to hang out. He says he has and that no one wants to hang out with him because he doesn’t play sports anymore. He feels like he doesn’t fit in anywhere. Growing up I felt this way too and leaned towards depression. I don’t have any answers for him. I don’t know how to help him make friends and it’s killing me. Every suggestion I have, he shoots down. I feel horrible for him. Any advice? Thanks!

My kid won't use sunscreen. Natural consequences or punishment?,"My 13 year old is blonde haired, blue eyed, and fair skinned. We have a pool at home but he likes to go to the community pool with friends. They are limiting the number and the lifeguards are enforcing social distancing so I have been allowing it. The problem is this kid refuses to use sunscreen. He ends up burned but doesn't care. His skin is red and peeling but he still won't use sunscreen. He says he forgets but even when he sets reminders he still doesn't apply. He says his friends don't use it. 

When he's home I can force it on him. I have 3 younger kids and they apply sunscreen before going outside and periodically throughout the day. He doesn't mind using it at home and will even help the youngest apply sunscreen. 

Normally we like to use natural consequences. In this case that means he doesn't use sunscreen so he gets sunburned.

Trouble with 13 year old son,"My wife and I are at a loss with our 13 year old son. Back story, my wife had him when she was 18 or 19. The biological dad wanted nothing to do with him, denied him his whole life, his family denied the kid, whatever. My wife stepped up and raised him as a single parent. I came into the picture 8 years ago so I've helped raise him since he was 5-6 years old. I am a strict parent, my wife is the easy lenient one. I will admit that I have spanked my kid, I was spanked when I was a kid and I feel all kids need that kind of discipline, especially when they are really out of hand.  
Fast forward to years 10 and up in his life. My wife lets him roam the streets in our town, alone with his friends. Now more recently, we've found out that he has been smoking pot with friends, unsure if he has done any other drugs but pot is a fact. I have left the discipline to my wife because we feel that if I get myself involved, I may hurt him more than I want. She has threatened to ground him, take things away, and he would cry and whine for a couple days and promise he wouldn't smoke pot again. Well that usually lasts less than a month and he's back to doing it. Now with covid and things, he has been out of school so he is free to roam during the day as we both work. His 11 year old sister recently sent us videos of his friends' social media accounts of he and his friends smoking pot on video! Little punk is smiling and laughing while taking hits. So a couple days ago me and my wife had a sit down with him, he wants nothing of it. He is freely disrespecting my wife and saying he doesn't care this, doesn't care that. So I speak up, not even raising my voice let alone getting physical and ask him why he feels the need to put down his mother like that when she is the one that stepped up to raise him by herself when his biological father abandoned him like a piece of trash. I even told him, he could hate me all he wants and he could stab me with a knife all he wants from the way I've treated him in the past but the last person he should be putting down is his mother. Granted I could have raised him and treated him better as a child, I was a strict parent to him. Meaning I would ground him over little things but I feel all kids especially boys, should follow some sort of guideline so they don't go out of wack.   
He has his own cell phone and he broke it recently and feels like we owe it to him to get him a new one yesterday. I tell him if he wants to be an adult so bad, when he thinks he can mouth off to us and go roaming as he likes, he can mature up like an adult and start paying his own bills like getting a new cell phone to replace the one he broke.   
We are just at a loss with this kid. If covid wasn't in existence, we really feel we'd be sending him away to some boarding school. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and refuses to take his meds.

Turns out she had her friend on a video call and her friend needed a Mom-ish person to talk to. (Her friend is being raised by a single dad who is wonderful, but her friend wanted to talk to a woman for the perspective of someone who knows what it's like to be a young girl.)

My daughter and her friend and I talked for a while about the issue and it seems like her friend found it helpful.

Apparently my daughter had talked me up to her friend, describing me as someone eminently knowledgeable and very trustworthy and understanding! Her friend had been reluctant but she'd reassured her friend that talking to me would help.

Teen stealing my things,"I’m (20F) the guardian of my sister (14)

Why am I failing even though I try so hard?,"My 14 year old was caught drinking last night. He used his own money to buy captain Morgan and coolers.

Three months ago he was caught vaping.

He lies.

I saw him trying to convince his girlfriend in a snapchat conversation not to take the vow of chastity she was thinking about. 

His gay friend asked him to kiss and and he would give him some alcohol. And he did.

We talk to him about things like peer pressure, trusting your gut, making the right choice, relationship stuff including consent ... we are open and honest with him and I don’t know what else we can do.

"TIL...the best feeling in the world, parental pride!!","My son turned 17 a few days ago.  He's been working at a farm for 3 years now.  He gets up everyday at 6am and rides his bike.

This weekend he decided to buy a new dirt bike and the owner of the farm is such an amazing fellow, he told my young lad he could park it and ride it at the farm.

Today while dropping off said bike, the farmer says ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you"" at me.  ""How can I help you""? I asked.

""You did a great job with that one there"" he says...""Always on time, never misses a day, knows how to fix things and weld, always polite and cares about others"", ""Great job"", as he reached out to elbow bump me (Covid).

It was all I could do to keep my lump in my throat from turning to tears. Haha🤣

I dont know why it means so much, perhaps farmers are the best judge of character I can think of?

I have taught her (and all my kids) to say thank you when they were young, at some point I tried letting her do it on her own Bc she would be upset Bc she was “going to say thank you.” Sometimes when I remind her she’ll say “oh, thanks,”  and I honestly don’t even feel like it’s genuine. I have gone months with out buying things like, (very needed) school shoes, because she shows no gratitude for anything.

Supporting non-binary child?,"Hello!

I’m kind of stressing disproportionately about something involving my 13-year-old child (AFAB, still primarily using she/her pronouns) and I just need some feedback. 

Basically, she told us about a year ago that she thought she was bisexual. We thanked her for telling us, told her “we love you no matter what,” etc — all the stuff you say. Since then, she’s begun identifying as lesbian and gotten very interested in LGBTQ culture. All of this is fine.

Over the last few months, she’s been expressing some interest in non-binary identities. And a few days ago, she told us she’s identifying as non-binary and wants to use a more androgynous name. To give you an idea of the kind of change I’m talking about, let’s say her birth name is Daisy and the new name is Payton. 

And I’m having a really, really hard time dealing with it. To us, it came out of the blue. She wasn’t a princessy kid, but all of her interests, hobbies, etc. have always been pretty feminine and she’s never expressed discomfort with her body or feminine presentation. She also doesn’t seem to want any boy’s clothes or anything, and showed us a meme about how “non-binary does not mean androgynous.”

Also, I have the typical old person confusion over what exactly “feeling non-binary” is. But I’m willing to accept that it’s a thing Payton identifies with even if she has a hard time expressing exactly why. I also wonder if some of this is just being bored in lockdown for four months, even though I know people don’t declare new identities out of boredom. 

I guess my question is, how can I best accept this about my child and be supportive when it’s hard for me to understand?",0,"Supporting non-binary child? Hello!

How to remind teen to do his chores without being a nag?,"So we’re on month 4 of lockdown and for the most part, the teenager hasn’t been held to much responsibility outside of the (extra credit) homework he had assigned and his daily (Mon-Thurs) chores. He doesn’t wake up until well after noon, he stays up playing video games all night, but since he’s my husband’s nephew and has only been living with us for the past 2 years, we’re trying to be realistic about his adaptability to contributing to chores and having expectations put on him for the first time in his life. It’s been a struggle getting him to even understand how to do his chores let alone doing them on schedule without being asked. (Mon - take out the trash and recycling, Tues - sweep kitchen, Wed - vacuum living room and hallway, and clean up the bathroom he exclusively uses, Thurs - pick up dog poo, then help with dishes Mon-Thurs.) We’ve had plenty of conversations about needing to wake up at a reasonable time and getting his chores done without being asked but the last two weeks (since we got home from a road trip and since we got him a VR headset JUST because he asked for one...) he’s back to not getting up until after 3/4/5pm and hasn’t been on top of anything. I have tried to not be on his ass about it because I feel like I’m always being the bad guy but the couple of times I tried to mention something needing to get done, it’s been met with exasperation and an attitude. Today I finally sat him down and explained that we’re not even asking for an hour out of his day and he has all day to do these tasks and it doesn’t warrant him giving us an attitude when he hasn’t done anything on time in weeks. So after he begrudgingly did today’s chores and one of his chores from yesterday that didn’t get done, he just went back in his room. The bathroom didn’t get cleaned up last week nor yesterday and this is a teenage boy’s bathroom so it’s basically disgusting enough to need a cleaning on a weekly basis (and until 2 weeks ago, used to be every-other-week but he always responded with “oh I thought I did it last week” so I finally told him it’s gotta be done every week then). So now I don’t know what to do. It’s 9pm, I doubt he has plans to get it done tonight, but we JUST had a conversation about this not even 3 hours ago so I don’t really feel like I should have to go remind him and I’m not looking forward the the response I would get from him...

TL;DR just talked to teenager about not doing his chores and 3 hours later, he still hasn’t done them all — I’m not interested in having another argument about it but how do I remind him without getting attitude back?",0,"How to remind teen to do his chores without being a nag? So we’re on month of lockdown and for the most part, the teenager hasn’t been held to much responsibility outside of the (extra credit) homework he had assigned and his daily (Mon-Thurs) chores. He doesn’t wake up until well after noon, he stays up playing video games all night, but since he’s my husband’s nephew and has only been living with us for the past years, we’re trying to be realistic about his adaptability to contributing to chores and having expectations put on him for the first time in his life. It’s been a struggle getting him to even understand how to do his chores let alone doing them on schedule without being asked. (Mon - take out the trash and recycling, Tues - sweep kitchen, Wed - vacuum living room and hallway, and clean up the bathroom he exclusively uses, Thurs - pick up dog poo, then help with dishes Mon-Thurs.) We’ve had plenty of conversations about needing to wake up at a reasonable time and getting his chores done without being asked but the last two weeks (since we got home from a road trip and since we got him a VR headset JUST because he asked for one...) he’s back to not getting up until after 3/4/5pm and hasn’t been on top of anything. I have tried to not be on his ass about it because I feel like I’m always being the bad guy but the couple of times I tried to mention something needing to get done, it’s been met with exasperation and an attitude. Today I finally sat him down and explained that we’re not even asking for an hour out of his day and he has all day to do these tasks and it doesn’t warrant him giving us an attitude when he hasn’t done anything on time in weeks. So after he begrudgingly did today’s chores and one of his chores from yesterday that didn’t get done, he just went back in his room. The bathroom didn’t get cleaned up last week nor yesterday and this is a teenage boy’s bathroom so it’s basically disgusting enough to need a cleaning on a weekly basis (and until weeks ago, used to be every-other-week but he always responded with “oh I thought I did it last week” so I finally told him it’s gotta be done every week then). So now I don’t know what to do. It’s 9pm, I doubt he has plans to get it done tonight, but we JUST had a conversation about this not even hours ago so I don’t really feel like I should have to go remind him and I’m not looking forward the the response I would get from him...

How much do you monitor your teenager's online activity?,"High functioning autistic teen (14F). Her social anxiety means she doesn't go out at all except to travel between home and dad's home. Following years of school refusal, we managed to get some support. She is tutored at home by the local education authority because she cannot handle a school environment. Doesn't have real life friends.

At her dad's this weekend he noticed she was messaging someone and asked who. She's been messaging 3 other people, one in this country and two abroad, that she met on Wattpad. They then moved to discord.

I think we should know what she is posting online and should at the least have her usernames for her social media accounts, which we have for her other social media and for siblings. For example, she has instagram on the basis I can follow her. Same for sibling/steps fb and instagram pages (fiance follows his kids/I follow mine).

But she is reluctant to give her wattpad username, stating her reasons as anxiety and insecurity over the quality of her story writing.

The same applies for the discord group.

But for me, this raises red flags in conjunction with her not telling us she was messaging these people for the last couple of months.

I am really uncertain what to do for the best. Her dad (my ex) thinks its positive that she has friends, even if only online. I am more concerned that she's already closed off from real life, has no social norms to follow as she hasn't been able to attend school for years and wouldn't necessarily pick up on whether something was 'off'.

She insists she's being safe and not giving out personal information but she can't see what potential dangers there are.

She often shuts down. My concern is by insisting she shares her wattpad/discord, she will completely withdraw.

I have spoken with her to talk about my concerns and to get her point of view. I have said that I will need to talk more with her dad and step dad about what to do, given that she has not stuck to the boundary we set for all kids of knowing their usernames and being able to see what they post online.

Autism is hard,"My 19 year old girl is a great kid. Honestly, she’s funny, she’s smart (she doesn’t think she is, despite being told all the time), and she works harder than anyone I’ve ever known. During the global event that shall not be named, she’s been furloughed by her regular job and she’s been volunteering at the local hospital for three days a week, and a disability charity for the other three. She’s absolutely awesome. But, that behaviour doesn’t cross the threshold into our house.

Since she was little she’s had a problem with taking things, it started with food, in that she will eat and eat and eat and never feel full. When she was maybe 8, she went into the larder, took two weeks worth of lunchbox snacks and ate them all in her room. We didn’t notice until the next morning when we went to put her and her younger brothers packed lunches together and there was nothing there. I remember crying when I found it, we were living on a very small budget and we couldn’t afford to replace it. Questioning her has always just resulted in “I don’t know” answers, because she genuinely doesn’t know. She doesn’t know why she’s doing it, and she doesn’t know she’s not supposed to be doing it. She’s graduated from taking food now to taking things from our rooms, I’ve had underwear stolen, I’ve had money taken, Christmas gifts, she even took a compact out of my room that belonged to my grandmother that still has a little bit of the powder in it and took it to work, I didn’t notice for weeks and in the time she had it, it got completely destroyed. Now not only is the food cupboard padlocked shut, my room and her brothers room is too because we’re constantly having our privacy invaded, and when we asked her why, she doesn’t know and she doesn’t understand why we’re upset by it. It’s easier to lock it down than to try and get her to stop.

The latest thing is razors. She’s 19, so she’s wants to explore stuff and do the things teenagers do and that includes shaving her legs. The trouble is, she’s about 12 in terms of her mental age, and she can’t do it unsupervised. She tried, but she cut herself so badly that she left a trail of blood from the bathroom to her bedroom (that she didn’t notice). She tried again, same thing. I told her that she absolutely is allowed to shave her legs, but I would help her next time so I can point out where she went wrong but it happened again. She refused to ask for help, so I said that if she wasn’t going to, and she was just going to continue butchering herself then she wasn’t allowed to do it until she was more “ready.” Which, physically, she is, but mentally, no. So I put her razors in the bin, and told her exactly why, that I 100% understand why she wants to shave (leaving out the fact that it’s unnecessary societal pressure and she shouldn’t let anyone tell her that she has to), that I will help her, that I will ALWAYS help her and there’s no need for her to do it in secret especially if she is just cutting herself to ribbons every time (and not noticing the cuts, and leaving the blood trail for me to clean up), so until she feels ready to ask for help, her razors would be binned. She agreed, she doesn’t know how to do it, she does need help but maybe it’s not such a big deal for her just yet and I was like, cool. End of discussion.

Or so I thought. I’m a busy mum, and there are times that I leave my door unlocked because I’m doing other things and it slips my mind, and the same goes for my 14 year old boy. This morning, she’s getting ready to go to the hospital for her volunteer shift and she’s got a bright red moustache made of spots. Her legs are red and covered in the same spots. I immediately freak out and ask  if they’re itchy, has she eaten something unusual, I wonder if it’s an allergy. But in fact she’s been rummaging through our bedrooms in the relatively small windows that we leave them unlocked, finding our razors and shaving herself. She shaved her face. I asked why, she doesn’t know. I asked where she found the razors, she didn’t know. Turns out she’s used her brothers for her legs, and mine for her face. She’s actually even been taking used blades out of the bin and shaving with those. I’m sitting here an hour after she’s left for work and I’m still trying to figure out why she would shave her damn face. She thought she had a moustache, she didn’t at ALL, but she does now, albeit a. bright red, pus filled one.

I live in Fort Knox. The kitchen is locked, my bedroom is locked, my sons bedroom is locked. We can’t even leave them undone for five minutes or she’ll be in looking for stuff. We cant have any privacy unless we lock ourselves in our rooms. She doesn’t sleep at night, so every morning I have to wake her up. I have to help her get dressed because she just stands there for ages until she’s late for work if I don’t. Brushing her teeth is a daily battle, she doesn’t like the electric toothbrush noise, but if she uses a manual, I have to do it for her because she won’t do it properly. I’m exhausted. I love her to death, but it’s been 19 years of this. Medical professionals told us she’s probably outgrow her ASD as she got older, because as it goes, it’s fairly mild, so we don’t actually get any help aside from a couple of years of therapy when she was little. We’re certainly lucky, because we know it could always be worse. But she is *getting* worse. She doesn’t melt down as much as she used to but when she does, it’s more violent and destructive than it used to be, and now there’s this constant state of vigilance that we have to live in because she can’t keep her hands to herself. We went back to the gp last summer and asked for her to be re-assessed because we need some help with this, they agreed and told us a referral would be made and we could expect it in about 9 months. That would have been in March. The thing that shall not be named has obviously slowed it down, but honestly I don’t know how much more we can take. 

My mother wasn’t a good parent. She was physically and mentally abusive to me, and I am very conscious of that legacy and I have never, ever hit my children. I prefer to sit down and talk things through with them, most issues are solvable that way. But this morning, after a long weekend of her screaming at me instead of talking to me, of her sitting there with blood pouring out of razor burn on her top lip and swearing she doesn’t know how it got there, even though I know she can’t help it, I felt it. I felt the sheer bloody anger rising in me and I had to walk away. I know I’m not my mother. The fact I walked away shows me that I’m not but I worry that I have it in me. I felt it today for the first time and it scared me.

I don’t even know...sorry if this is all over the place, just ranting really because I’m so damn tired.",0,"Autism is hard My year old girl is a great kid. Honestly, she’s funny, she’s smart (she doesn’t think she is, despite being told all the time), and she works harder than anyone I’ve ever known. During the global event that shall not be named, she’s been furloughed by her regular job and she’s been volunteering at the local hospital for three days a week, and a disability charity for the other three. She’s absolutely awesome. But, that behaviour doesn’t cross the threshold into our house.  Since she was little she’s had a problem with taking things, it started with food, in that she will eat and eat and eat and never feel full. When she was maybe 8, she went into the larder, took two weeks worth of lunchbox snacks and ate them all in her room. We didn’t notice until the next morning when we went to put her and her younger brothers packed lunches together and there was nothing there. I remember crying when I found it, we were living on a very small budget and we couldn’t afford to replace it. Questioning her has always just resulted in “I don’t know” answers, because she genuinely doesn’t know. She doesn’t know why she’s doing it, and she doesn’t know she’s not supposed to be doing it. She’s graduated from taking food now to taking things from our rooms, I’ve had underwear stolen, I’ve had money taken, Christmas gifts, she even took a compact out of my room that belonged to my grandmother that still has a little bit of the powder in it and took it to work, I didn’t notice for weeks and in the time she had it, it got completely destroyed. Now not only is the food cupboard padlocked shut, my room and her brothers room is too because we’re constantly having our privacy invaded, and when we asked her why, she doesn’t know and she doesn’t understand why we’re upset by it. It’s easier to lock it down than to try and get her to stop.  The latest thing is razors. She’s 19, so she’s wants to explore stuff and do the things teenagers do and that includes shaving her legs. The trouble is, she’s about in terms of her mental age, and she can’t do it unsupervised. She tried, but she cut herself so badly that she left a trail of blood from the bathroom to her bedroom (that she didn’t notice). She tried again, same thing. I told her that she absolutely is allowed to shave her legs, but I would help her next time so I can point out where she went wrong but it happened again.

Ex not respecting house rules and being manipulative of daughter.,"Sorry in advanced for the novel and mobile formatting.

I'm in a hard spot, i divorced my ex wife when my daughter was two. She wad emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive and had been arrested for assault against me and her ex a few times. She was sober with me but after the divorce immediately went back to drugs. I got custody as she had no way of t as king care of my daughter and liked partying and using more anyways. I remarried fairly  quickly and even though we've had a couple big bumps my wife and i have always put kids first to the point my daughter calls her momma. A few years ago my ex went to prison for a bunch of separate charges but somehow got everything  deferred except felony child abuse. Naturally with the litany of things I've learned along with the laundry list of other incedents including going to pick my kid up from cps during her visitations, i was awarded sole custody. My kiddo is now 13 and after several  years is out of prison, against my better judgment ive allowed phone calls and facetime. On a semi related note, even though she is a phenomenal  teen her phone has gotten her into trouble in the past (basic dumb kid stuff) but now as a rule is subject to as non invasive  quick looks as possible. Basically check net history and apps for stuff she shouldn't have. I know that sounds bad but im 100% against the parent apps and she is smart enough to make parental control settings worthless. But at any rate she is damn near a perfect kid for this age. Now that its summer i got lax on bed time rules and usually tell her go to sleep when my wife and i go to bed (12ish), but ive noticed her clicking off her screen really fast. I let it slide at first because benefit of the doubt, but its happened more frequently  and her attitude has gone to shit. So i decided to check her phone and noticed the last text she had gotten was at 1230am from her mom. Ive already talked to both of 5hem previously and both know this is 100% against the rules. My dad senses started tingling so i checked her messages. For lack of a better word she has been grooming my daughter. She has her following  her work schedule to talk and text non stop, every  other text is increasingly aggressive i love you messages. I'm not talking oh i love you so much but ""i love you more than the whole world, you are my everything, i don't know what i would do without you well be together soon i love you 100% dont ever let any one doubt that shit"" was about half the last one. She is not going to see her any time soon, i know this pattern as ssf he did the same thing after she would ignore her a year at a time during my deployments leaving her with my wife missing all visitations and start this up as soon as i got back. Im at a loss, only thing i can think is phone and laptop are picked up after 9pm. Do i nix communication?

Disturbing teenage boy behaviour need advice,"Hello,

I’m a 25 Male from the U.K. My Sister-in law contacted me said her son (he’s 14) has been searching porn, I said immediately that it’s normal and I was and my mates were doing the same at his age.

She said his search history shows he’s been watching porn of a disturbing nature,  father raping 8 year old girl, mother kissing son, rape in general etc. Hentai and lesbian kissing I think most teenage boys have been guilty of looking this up. He’s been caught searching porn before (who doesn’t delete their history lol?) 

There was an incident at school last year where he groped a girls arse and kissed her on the lips without consent. 

His mother is rightfully concerned and disturbed by this and we’re all a bit worried how he’s going to turn out later in life and would rather nip this in the bud now. I don’t have kids myself and so yeah, find myself here asking for advice? 

Some background context: My sister-in law was a victim of marital rape with her ex husband which her son knows about. Her new husband has abused her also (strangling, hitting, shouting etc) been telling her for years now to leave him. 

I reckon it’s a nurture over nature. If he’s exposed to these bad things and there’s no consequence to these heinous actions then is it any wonder if the boy is thinking it’s ok despite being told it’s wrong?

Parental Alienation,"Ok fellow parents, hang in there as this could be a long read. So before hand, I appreciate any and all advice.  

I am a career military man with two children from a previous marriage. I met “M” when I was about 26 years old in 2001 and my two prior born children were 4 years and 3 years old. We got together, had a quick relationship that saw us become pregnant with my second daughter, third child. I asked “M” to marry me and she said yes and we were not married until after our daughter was born. Before we were married she was great with my other two children, but a few weeks after our marriage, she sat me down one night and said “I’m not stepmom material so either you sign your rights away permanently to your other children and never see them again or I’m leaving you”. Well, that was easy, I had the marriage annulled and we went our separate ways with me still seeing our daughter under state guidelines and paying my support. 

Then I was told that I was being deployed abroad. Once that happened “M” said you can just stop seeing our daughter and then maybe she’ll forget about you while you are gone.  She cut off all visitation which led me to hire a lawyer who filed for an emergency hearing to force her to allow me visitations, which the judge approved and ordered.  I was deployed shortly after she turned 2 and gone for a year and a half. I had supervised visits upon my return because she was still so young, which “M”‘fought but the local police department enforced.  

As our daughter grew up, she slowly cut off seeing me and wanting to be with me, always siding with her mom about everything. I understand children can be influenced so just did my best to stay in her life. It finally got to where she stopped coming all together and avoided me at all costs. BUT, on a few occasions she did come to stay with me and we have had a blast.  I thing but smiles, laughs, and love with lots of photos of us doing just that. 

Fast forward to today. Our daughter is now 17 years old and only contacts me when she wants or needs something. Other than that she has completely cut off all communication with me. She’s super smart and just finished high school a year early and called me for help with college, which I had no issue with. I helped here do her FAFSA and worked with the college to make sure she is set to start this fall. After that was done, I haven’t heard from her again for a good while. 

Today I learned that her high school had its graduation ceremony, which she attended, but I didn’t learn about it until later this evening. I was not told nor invited. I sent her an nice message telling her congratulations and that I was proud of her and that she should have told me. She just shrugged me off. I also told her that  had she invited me I would have been there and I hope she invites me to her college graduation and that now that she’s done with school, we should work on our relationship. That message received no response at all. 

So, what in the hell should I do now? I love my daughter but her mom has instilled in her this deep hatred for me that has absolutely no reasoning behind it. I’m starting to feel like I am just wasting my time but don’t want to be another poster bad dad. I’ll take any advice that you have and please feel free to ask any questions.

Our daughter is now years old and only contacts me when she wants or needs something. Other than that she has completely cut off all communication with me. She’s super smart and just finished high school a year early and called me for help with college, which I had no issue with. I helped here do her FAFSA and worked with the college to make sure she is set to start this fall. After that was done, I haven’t heard from her again for a good while.   Today I learned that her high school had its graduation ceremony, which she attended, but I didn’t learn about it until later this evening. I was not told nor invited. I sent her an nice message telling her congratulations and that I was proud of her and that she should have told me. She just shrugged me off. I also told her that  had she invited me I would have been there and I hope she invites me to her college graduation and that now that she’s done with school, we should work on our relationship. That message received no response at all.   So, what in the hell should I do now? I love my daughter but her mom has instilled in her this deep hatred for me that has absolutely no reasoning behind it. I’m starting to feel like I am just wasting my time but don’t want to be another poster bad dad. I’ll take any advice that you have and please feel free to ask any questions.  Thanks in advance!",19,2,3328,635,Teenager 13-19 Years

Teen defied COVID restrictions. Now what?,"Our teens have been isolated for over four months since we self-quarantined early due to two immunocompromised family members as well as several family members with co-morbitities.  We live in a COVID hotbed area in the US.  

It was taking a toll on their mental health and they had really stepped up (some happily some not) to do more around the house when needed especially with daycares closed and their dad and I WFH.

We decided to reward them each with one socially distanced, outdoors visit with ONE friend.

Today was my daughter’s turn.  She told me she and her friend wore their mask the whole time and other than walking to a convenience store were socially distanced at the park the whole day.  She even went so far as to put on a big show of asking if she could hug her friend.

My son came barreling down the stairs angry as hell and showed us some social media posts from my daughter, hanging out with a big crowd of people, at the store with no mask, taking maskless selfies with her friend, who was NOT masked for the day as requested, and finally, in SOMEONE’S HOME.

She’s definitely grounded, though I haven’t figured out the details.  

What do I do about isolation?  We bought her a brand new iPhone we scarce could afford in exchange for her helping with her siblings during this time.  I don’t think it’s safe for her to watch them which means another sibling will have to take her days.  But I have already ‘paid’ each of them in their various desired currencies.  It isn’t fair to the other siblings.  

Also I don’t know how to manage the shared kitchen and bathroom.  

Grounding during a pandemic is also tricky with no other outlets.  They each have a tv and gaming system, a laptop, etc.  They aren’t deprived although this particular child always feels as though she is.  To take it all away when there’s nothing else...I’m just not sure about.

I’m fuming mad.  Any advice would be helpful.  

Please don’t shame me for letting them go out- they have literally not left home in four months and I had to balance all the needs including mental health (the teens all suffer from depression, it runs in the family.)",0,"Teen defied COVID restrictions.

"Daughter (14) went to a party, with boys","So, my daughter went to a birthday party last night. It was for a boy, and there were a mixture of boys and girls, all people she knew from school. We live in a small town, 5 minutes away, so we let her go.

My wife goes to pick her up, and she is in a swimming pool, with her best friend (female) and 3 boys. She took her pants off and was swimming in her panties and a shirt. Wife was livid, and I feel rightfully so. I was at work, and she told me.

I just feel that underwear is a more intimate thing, something you should keep private. Our daughter argues that it covers the same as a bathing suit.

My daughter is smart, beautiful, and usually makes very good choices, but I believe the pressure to be accepted by boys that she is attracted to will cause her to not think things through.

My fear is, these boys are going to go around bragging that they got my daughter in her underwear.

If they can talk her into doing that, god knows what the next step would be.

However she mentioned to me that she doesn't REALLY care about anything, and I can really see that in her. It's not just now, it's since she was tiny, always. 

Birthdays and Christmas she doesn't really want anything and never has, I always thought that she's just not very materialistic. I still get her things but the small drone I bought her last Christmas is still in its box unplayed with. She chose it!

She loves animals and we've had several. She's very upset for a short time when they die but she gets over it quite quickly. 

I have offered to help her remake her bedroom as there isnt much storage and she leaves it very messy. I finally got her to choose one piece of furniture but she really didn't care.

Peeved and wondering if this strategy is taking things too far,"So, I have two teenage boys.  Overall good kids, but they do bicker back and forth.  My wife and I will get occasional treats for them, 6 pack of soda, pint size special ice cream, etc...  Occasionally I get myself a treat.

I noticed that my soda is disappearing quicker than I am drinking it.  I ask each boy about it and of course they don't know anything about it, it wasn't them, it was the other one, etc...

I am thinking about getting some silver nitrate solution and putting it on my soda.  It won't hurt them, but will stain their skin and I will know for certain who actually took something (at least this time).

The point won't be to punish them, but rather let them know I know am aware of what you did and I don't appreciate it, if you want something, you need to ask.  That sort of conversation.

Should I send my kid to school in the U.S. to follow his basketball dream?," 

My family lives in a large Canadian city.  About 5 years ago my oldest son (now 17) took to basketball and immediately fell in love with the game.  He has always been a very tenacious, single minded, strong willed kid, and when basketball became his passion he was all in.  He began practicing all the time, waking up early, going to the gym 2 - 3 times a day, training with his school team, training with his rep team, getting individual training, training on his own, etc.  The level of dedication (obsession) he gave to sport began to be all consuming.  He radically changed his diet to what he thought it should be, (tonnes of fruit and veg, very little protein) despite my wife and I explaining what a proper diet should be.  It got to the point we had to take him to sports DR. to set him straight with his diet because he wasn't listening to us and bordering on an eating disorder.

My wife and I are not sports people, but because we love and support our kids we are committed to helping them achieve their dreams.  My son, around the age of 15, decided he wanted to play D1 or D2, and then maybe a career playing in Europe if he doesn't make NBA.  (He's now barely 5'10 and plays point guard BTW, so quite short in basketball world)  He has managed to get himself onto some good reps teams , but has spent much of that time on the bench, playing very little. He is still 110% committed to his dream, training most of the time like an elite athlete would, but he is often disappointed in himself and his performance in any given game or training session.  He can be very hard on himself.

Because my wife and I are not sports people, we are having a hard time judging his true potential.  We are told by our trusted advisors who know way more than us that he certainly has the spark and tenacity needed, but he seems to choke more often that not when he does get his chance to shine.

He gets good grades and applied to a few schools in the states, but ultimately he was only accepted by a Christian Prep school with a basketball focus in a southern state.  My wife and I are both non religious (both grew up Christians though), but our son has expressed a passive interest in religion so we're not too opposed to  him going to a Christian school and learning religious / christian teachings.    My son wants to go, despite the raging pandemic in the U.S., despite any of us having been to the campus, despite 2 to 3 to a dorm room, despite never having been away from home more than a week for camp, etc...

My son wants to go, no question, but my wife and I are really struggling.  On one hand, who are we to stand in his way?  He has worked very hard to get to this point, to get accepted to the school, and his single focused nature tells him going to the U.S. only way to get better and seen by U.S. scouts.  On the other hand, there is a very scary pandemic going on obviously, and sending your kid down into that is a very uncomfortable thought.  And if he's benched a lot of the time on his rep teams here, is he good enough to make a go of it down there?  If Basketball gets shut down in US, then what?  (He will continue going to a high school with a good basketball program in Canada if he doesn't go to the US, but no assurances he will be played much)

This decision needs to made soon.  Do we let him go or say no?",0,"Should I send my kid to school in the U.S. to follow his basketball dream?

My son wants to go, no question, but my wife and I are really struggling.  On one hand, who are we to stand in his way?  He has worked very hard to get to this point, to get accepted to the school, and his single focused nature tells him going to the U.S. only way to get better and seen by U.S. scouts.  On the other hand, there is a very scary pandemic going on obviously, and sending your kid down into that is a very uncomfortable thought.  And if he's benched a lot of the time on his rep teams here, is he good enough to make a go of it down there?  If Basketball gets shut down in US, then what?  (He will continue going to a high school with a good basketball program in Canada if he doesn't go to the US, but no assurances he will be played much)  This decision needs to made soon.  Do we let him go or say no?",74,15,3339,641,Teenager 13-19 Years

Need ideas for son's 14th Birthday during pandemic,"My son will be 14 this month. I'm trying to think of something to do for his birthday. We are very much social distancing, so safety and following CDC guidelines is a priority. He's done a couple of social distance backyard movie nights with his friends already, so that wouldn't be something special. 

Another option is a drive-by party. Are those still a thing?

My just turned 14 year old has a girlfriend the same age - and she's bad news..,"My just turned 14 year old son has hit puberty hard and fast -  6ft 1 and advanced for his years. 

4 months ago he let us know he has a girlfriend who he met through Instagram. She is in the same year as him. 

He's a smart, good kid - an a grade student at a top academic school. 

Since letting us know about the relationship things have gone down hill for him. He's withdrawn and spends every second on his phone either texting or talking to her. 

His grades have suffered as have his relationships. 

And now it turns out : she has suggested to him via text they have sex - which as we all know is statutory rape at this age -  she has also threatened to end it all, lol herself, , leave him and other manipulative stuff. We have overheard him pleading with her, telling her he loves her and wants to marry her.......

It's three in the morning as I write this, it's stressing me so much. 

I know we need to stop this immediately but don't want to alienate him at the same time.

Senior child won't study - final exams,"I'd be really interested in parents'' opinions and reality checks.

My daughter has always had learning issues. She's been categorised by her school as 'twice exceptional', so superior IQ but something's getting in the way of effective learning.  In her case its long standing depression/ anxiety/ ADD all diagnosed, all sorts of meds tried and failed. She's 17. We're taking a break from meds. She's coming up to trial exams (Mock A levels for those in UK , not sure of USA equivalent). 

She can't study effectively. She does homework but can't revise. I don't know how to help. She has tutoring in maths but refuses to engage with tutors in other areas. She says she doesn't care. She's in psychotherapy. I need it too but can only afford one therapist for our family and she won.  She is not prepared in any meaningful way and it stresses her out. I need to pull back and it's so hard because I could study and did well at school but she's probably not going to. Did this happen to you?  How did you cope? She has no plans for after school do no goals to help with motivation. She's bright!  Help.

Upper lip hair removal for daughter (13),"Hi , I am looking for advice . A few days ago a younger family member pointed out that my daughter has a moustache. She was quite mortified and began to cry , I tried to discuss it with her after the fact and let her know it’s totally normal but she did not want to talk about it . I know this age and puberty has already caused an abundance of insecurities and she is too shy to come to me with these concerns. I would like to let her know in a gentle way that there are solutions if she ever feels the need to have it removed but I don’t want to further draw attention to something she’s already feeling bad about . I am wondering if anyone has advice on how to approach it and also suggestions on something we can do at home to start (her pain tolerance isn’t very high and her shyness would make it difficult to get out to a salon ) I am trying to make an appointment with the doctor to ensure that her hormones aren’t off but I suspect this is mostly just due to her being half European as she has always had a little more hair .

Looking for advice- teenager relationships,"Hi, 

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my post. I have a 13.5 year old. He has been going out with a girl the same age for 8 months now. We have open conversations about sex and safety, he has told me he is not thinking about it. He says when he does he will talk to us. But, I know it only takes a few minutes behind a closed door for teenagers to make and irrational decision and get pregnant.

What should I do to make sure they are smart? Should I have an open door policy whichever room they are in? Communicate with her parents to make sure we’re on the same page and that they have the same rules at her house? 

I feel like if they really wanted to do something they could find a way. I think I’m overly nervous because I had him when I was a teenager and I don’t want him to endure what I did to get where I am.

Any advice is welcome. This is new parenting territory for me.",0,"Looking for advice- teenager relationships Hi,   Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my post. I have a 13.year old.

It would seem that my 17 yo child has discovered they are quite conservative. And it’s braking my heart. I have asked what they listen to so I can listen too and either learn something new or at the least maybe understand where they are coming from. We have had conversations about their thoughts and I have listened. I have not really given my opinions unless i agree with them. They very clearly think I’m ridiculous.  I’m very careful to never criticize or negate anything they say. I will ask more questions in an effort to understand. 

They have been raised in a home without guns, with privilege due to their skin color ( which I found out last night they don’t believe exists), with everyone in the family having (a reasonable) amount of say, in a very not diverse community. In a house, without worry about there being enough food (or at least they never knew when it was a worry). Overall, an extremely privileged life. 

How do I help them understand how privileged they are? How so many do not have the same privileges? Is it the age? Should I be fighting back more?",0,"When the politics don’t agree...

Introducing step siblings,"Bit of a back story. I have been a single mother for 13 years now. My son’s father and I agreed before he was born that I wanted to raise him alone, as his father was married with a child himself and I did not want my child to be involved in their lives. Anyways I have raised him alone the last 13 years and he is very accustom to just the two of us in our home. We have had a somewhat rocky relationship in the past but the last 3 years things have been much better and I can tell he is developing more into a well behaved young man. However, recently I started seeing someone. This is not my first boyfriend since he was born but none were ever serious enough to meet my son. Well this man and I have gotten very serious and have discussed moving in together this fall. He is a single father and has a daughter my sons age, and it would work perfectly since they both go to the same school and can walk together if we were to move in. I am just so worried about introducing them and how my son will react, and how to make sure things go well. Any suggestions?
Our original plan is to do a supper next week to introduce them to the fact we are dating and then maybe take them out to do some fun things next week as everything here has reopened.",0,"Introducing step siblings Bit of a back story.

Am I a bad parent for this? Long rant...,"My oldest is 16F, will be 17 in December. School was cancelled when COVID hit. I’d often ask her to do a chore here or a task there to help around the house when she wasn’t doing online homework. I work full time and am a single parent. I also have a 3 year old. School ended in early June and I found out that she didn’t complete her courses like she said she had. 

We’re now into week 3 of what’s officially summer vacation in our state and she’s constantly needing me to tell her what I need help with around the house or she does nothing. Like, it isn’t obvious that she needs to launder her clothes, clean up dishes in her room, feed and change her cats litter (which makes her room stench like hell itself), and last, but not least, help me with the dishes in the kitchen. 

I’ve had multiple talks with her that I’m at work 8 hours a day and I ask that she help me with one or two things so that I’m not stuck coming home to work after work. I come home to find that she’s just now decided to shower, is hungry, and nothing but her hobbies have been done all day. At that point I’m finding myself trying to cook around dirty dishes, needing to shower myself, and my 3 year old. And all she can account for doing is, well, shit. 

Today I had enough. There were a minimal amount of dishes in the sink. I texted her at 4pm (one hour before leaving work) to ask if she helped with some dishes. No answer. I get home and she’s watching tv on the couch and texting on her phone. She picks up her things and goes straight to the room. 

I avoided talking to her because I’m just gonna explode. Instead I send her a text saying, “from now on don’t use my dishes if you’re not going to help clean the kitchen.” I baked some frozen pizza for a quick dinner and she came out to get some...put it on a piece of paper towel and retreated to her room.

Teaching son online safety - bizarre silver lining with that fake AMA of the dying 14yo.,"There was an AMA yesterday with a 14 year old dying of a brain tumor. His responses to comments seemed roughly age-appropriate, humorous at times, brought some tears too. Fantastic redditors offered him once in a lifetime opportunities before he passed.

It was fake. I bought it. I had some tears reading through the comments. I imagined my (13) son in that position. I bought it completely. 

However. My son and I had yet another discussion tonight about him just getting all the access to all the internet. Every previous discussion has been these hypothetical ""what if you run across a bad guy"" type convos.

"Online school, trauma(?), and the summer","TLDR: Teen girl super upset about planned online summer school class, feels like it's too soon after COVID19-driven online schooling. Mom seeking advice.

We, like everyone, did online schooling for the last 2.5 months of the school year. Despite having every possible advantage (good school system, computers, internet, etc.) The end of the year was a struggle from the time our governor announced no more in-person schooling for the year. 

I chalk that up to a few things, depression, grief at missing year-end events, ad hoc instruction by teachers with little or no online instruction experience, and heaps of procrastination. There's a good bit of parent prodding that happened to get us across the finish line, I'll admit. It was not the happiest of times.

It was always our plan to do a high school requirement as a summer online course this summer. We registered and paid for it months ago. Well, it started today and so did the tears.

It's as if we just opened a barely healing wound here today. Feelings are still raw, and DD wants to throw in the towel already.

I'm trying to explain all the benefits that we get from doing this now. I am explaining how this is a course that's always online, taught by teachers who are experienced at delivering on line instruction. How we get a chance to build new distance learning skills in a relatively low-risk environment, which will serve us mightily if we are forced back into online learning next year.

Besides explaining, what other tools do I have to motivate or lead her to her own motivation?

I think my teenager hates me.,"This is long so tldr is that my teenage son is refusing to come down for the court ordered summer visitation and he wont talk to me much at all anymore. 

I dont know what to do. I'm heart broken and depressed. I think my oldest child hates me now and theres nothing I can do about it. 

My first born lived with me until he was 3.5 years old. Right just before he was 3 I had left for training for a job that didn't work out and I left him with my mom for that time. His father wanted nothing to do with him during his first few years and had barely started seeing his son so I didnt feel right leaving our son with him solely. I was gone 1 month and 6 days in my attempt to build a better life for my son and I. 

Being gone from my young child like that did a number on me and i was a mess by the time I was able to get home to him. A few weeks after returning home I was sexually assaulted. I was not doing well and my mother continued to bulk of the care of my son. I had turned 18 about 2 or 3 months prior to these things happening. 

While i was trying to recover mentally, my mom sent my son to live with his dad against my wishes. She told me it was best for him and I believed her. He immediately cut as much contact with my son and I as he could. He even went as far as literally forcing me to sign papers only allowing me to see our son every other weekend.

From there I spiralled pretty bad and started seeing a therapist regularly and got on meds. Once I hit 19 I got on some medications that were starting to help. I started going to the community college. And I got a vehicle. As soon as I started doing better I started pushing for more time with our son. My ex took him and left the city. Every few months they would contact me and let me see him. I never knew the address and when i did find out where they lived they would move. They would constantly change their phone number and I couldnt afford a lawyer. After a few years of this hell they moved back to tucson.

 I used the documentation I had stating every other weekend to force them to allow me visitation. This was going well until our son started telling me things like his father told him his step mother was his real mother, that I didn't really love him or want him. I started to repair my relationship with my son and show him and tell him how much I loved him and wanted him. 

When my son was almost 10 he told me he didnt want to kill himself but that he wanted something else to kill him. I took him to a behavioral health place to get him help. They spoke to him with me and then alone. They gave me a referral and a paper stating that he was being abused at his dads and that he was showing symptoms of suicidal ideation. 

His father refused to allow therapy and since we technically still have joint legal decision making they wouldn't see him without consent of both parents. Then my ex said they were moving out of state. 

I borrowed money and found a cheap lawyer. My son came over again and his father made him take a cell phone. I found bruises on his arms and took pictures. My son told me how his step mom would punch him or grab him and sometimes made him bleed from the pinches. 

After he returned to his father I found the cell phone in his room. I went through it and found countless texts between two adults about drug deals and selling pills. His father or step mom doing the selling and people texting to buy. This was the phone that was left in my kids care. I made a police report. I printed screen shots of all the texts and gave everything to my lawyer. 

When court happened my lawyer didnt submit any of the evidence I had compiled against my ex. This included threatening texts from my ex about letting them move or he would disappear again with our son and other things. 

Due to a clerical error my mom still had my portion of custody (I was 15 when I had my son). So that messed up the court hearing and they wouldnt talk to me because apparently I was not the legal guardian at this time even though I had visitation papers. The court let my ex move with our son as a temporary thing and I got everything transferred into my name. 

My lawyer continued to tell me he would submit the documents eventually (before the next court date) blah blah blah. And he didn't. I lost another court hearing which ended up with me only getting a total of like 4 weeks a year with our son. 

I borrowed more money and hired a better lawyer. She ended up getting me most of his school breaks but by that time he was in school and the courts deemed a move of households and schools wouldn't be fair to my son. So I was stuck. 

Every time my son came out to see me I had to repair my relationship with him all over again and when we finally got to a good point he would have to go back to his fathers house. 

He was supposed to come here for 10 weeks this summer. This is in the court papers. My son refused to fly so we agreed to come and get him and drive. He refused to come at all and stated he wouldnt even leave his bedroom. His father told me I had to agree to only 4 weeks and that's it or I wouldnt see him. 

I called my son on the cell phone that my husband and I pay for and asked him why he doesnt want to come here. My son said he doesnt wanna be stuck in a ""2 bedroom studio in the ghetto"" and that hes realized all of the lies ive told him ""over the years"". I know I have never lied to him about anything except things like santa or the easter bunny. 

We have had some financial issues during his time here where we weren't able to do everything we planned but ive tried making up for that with quality time spent together. 

Since all of this he wont tell me what he believes ive lied about. The police In his city wont help without a court order stating that they have to. I called them. My son won say anything more to me except ""I love you and miss you too"" and only in response to my messages. He wont talk to me at all beyond that. 

I explained to him that we pay for his phone so that he and I can have a relationship with each other. That got me a couple short responses and then it was back to silence with the exception of the love you miss you too. 

He wont talk to me, he wont let me talk to him. My lawyer said I could file papers holding his dad in contempt and force the issue but im afraid doing that will just hurt my son if I force him down here. 

I cry every day and this has been going on since early to mid May. My younger son is heart broken. I hide as much as I can from my younger son though because I dont want him to know how hurt I am. My oldest doesnt really know much about that either. 

My husband wants to cut my oldests phone service temporarily as punishment. We havent sent his birthday gift to him because we always give it to him in person when he comes down for the summer. He even refused to come down for his brothers birthday. 

I'm so lost and I would really appreciate some advice.",0,"I think my teenager hates me. This is long so tldr is that my teenage son is refusing to come down for the court ordered summer visitation and he wont talk to me much at all anymore.   I dont know what to do. I'm heart broken and depressed. I think my oldest child hates me now and theres nothing I can do about it.   My first born lived with me until he was 3.years old. Right just before he was I had left for training for a job that didn't work out and I left him with my mom for that time. His father wanted nothing to do with him during his first few years and had barely started seeing his son so I didnt feel right leaving our son with him solely. I was gone month and days in my attempt to build a better life for my son and I.   Being gone from my young child like that did a number on me and i was a mess by the time I was able to get home to him. A few weeks after returning home I was sexually assaulted. I was not doing well and my mother continued to bulk of the care of my son. I had turned about or months prior to these things happening.   While i was trying to recover mentally, my mom sent my son to live with his dad against my wishes. She told me it was best for him and I believed her. He immediately cut as much contact with my son and I as he could. He even went as far as literally forcing me to sign papers only allowing me to see our son every other weekend.  From there I spiralled pretty bad and started seeing a therapist regularly and got on meds. Once I hit I got on some medications that were starting to help. I started going to the community college. And I got a vehicle. As soon as I started doing better I started pushing for more time with our son. My ex took him and left the city. Every few months they would contact me and let me see him. I never knew the address and when i did find out where they lived they would move. They would constantly change their phone number and I couldnt afford a lawyer. After a few years of this hell they moved back to tucson.   I used the documentation I had stating every other weekend to force them to allow me visitation. This was going well until our son started telling me things like his father told him his step mother was his real mother, that I didn't really love him or want him. I started to repair my relationship with my son and show him and tell him how much I loved him and wanted him.   When my son was almost he told me he didnt want to kill himself but that he wanted something else to kill him. I took him to a behavioral health place to get him help. They spoke to him with me and then alone. They gave me a referral and a paper stating that he was being abused at his dads and that he was showing symptoms of suicidal ideation.   His father refused to allow therapy and since we technically still have joint legal decision making they wouldn't see him without consent of both parents. Then my ex said they were moving out of state.   I borrowed money and found a cheap lawyer. My son came over again and his father made him take a cell phone. I found bruises on his arms and took pictures. My son told me how his step mom would punch him or grab him and sometimes made him bleed from the pinches.   After he returned to his father I found the cell phone in his room. I went through it and found countless texts between two adults about drug deals and selling pills. His father or step mom doing the selling and people texting to buy. This was the phone that was left in my kids care. I made a police report. I printed screen shots of all the texts and gave everything to my lawyer.   When court happened my lawyer didnt submit any of the evidence I had compiled against my ex. This included threatening texts from my ex about letting them move or he would disappear again with our son and other things.   Due to a clerical error my mom still had my portion of custody (I was when I had my son). So that messed up the court hearing and they wouldnt talk to me because apparently I was not the legal guardian at this time even though I had visitation papers. The court let my ex move with our son as a temporary thing and I got everything transferred into my name.   My lawyer continued to tell me he would submit the documents eventually (before the next court date) blah blah blah. And he didn't. I lost another court hearing which ended up with me only getting a total of like weeks a year with our son.   I borrowed more money and hired a better lawyer. She ended up getting me most of his school breaks but by that time he was in school and the courts deemed a move of households and schools wouldn't be fair to my son. So I was stuck.   Every time my son came out to see me I had to repair my relationship with him all over again and when we finally got to a good point he would have to go back to his fathers house.   He was supposed to come here for weeks this summer. This is in the court papers. My son refused to fly so we agreed to come and get him and drive. He refused to come at all and stated he wouldnt even leave his bedroom. His father told me I had to agree to only weeks and that's it or I wouldnt see him.   I called my son on the cell phone that my husband and I pay for and asked him why he doesnt want to come here. My son said he doesnt wanna be stuck in a ""bedroom studio in the ghetto"" and that hes realized all of the lies ive told him ""over the years"". I know I have never lied to him about anything except things like santa or the easter bunny.   We have had some financial issues during his time here where we weren't able to do everything we planned but ive tried making up for that with quality time spent together.

Holding the Line During Covid,"Hi! Looking to hear from other parents with teenagers on how you’re handling the balance between maintaining covid safety protocols while still letting them get together with friends. I have two high school age boys. Both are good kids and they follow our parenting rules. In terms of covid, we definitely are on the more vigilant end of the spectrum with my wife setting the standard (and living by it). The challenge is our boys have friends from families that are much more lax. They don’t maintain social distancing, wear masks when they probably should, etc. Makes it hard on our boys when they try to get together. It pained me to hear from my younger son last night that he feels made fun of by his friends because of the higher standards he’s expected to adhere to. And I understand where they’re coming from because we have not been hit hard but covid where we live and don’t know anyone that has had it. In the bigger picture, this is not that big of a deal. We will eventually get through this. And I think this is a pretty typical teen challenge even without something like the pandemic. Still, it would be great to get some additional perspective from other parents. What’s worked for you? How are you teaching your teens to be socially responsible and to hold the line while still allowing them to interact with friends? How do you balance between respecting their POV but not compromising on what you feel is ethically right?",0,"Holding the Line During Covid Hi!

Accidentally saw a video my 14yo niece send to her group of friends regarding my kids,"
My cousin and I are very close, she got divorced 4years ago, around that time I moved to the same town as her and we live less than 5 min away of each other. Since then we become even more closer, sometimes I help her out with her daughter (now 14) she has  stayed hundreds of  times at my house for sleepovers, or to have dinner with us, she has traveled with us for a weekend getaways and all that, at first I always though she would be the perfect mommy helper ( I have 7M, 4M, 3F) but after she started spending more time with us and becoming more of a teenager I realize that while she loved my kids she wasn’t into that “role”. 
Today we spent the afternoon together after 4 months without seeing each other, at some point when I was fixing the kids dinner by myself  my niece approached me and say “ Hey look I made a Instagram group accidentally and you are in it, it was an accident you weren’t meant to be in it, just erase it” I didn’t pay much attention and carried on with my evening,  it wasn’t until later that I checked my IG, the group was her, another girl her age and a 22yo guy. She send them 2 pictures and a video, one picture was her with a bored face, another was my daughter and son playing together, and the video was very short maybe 10s, the kids playing together in toy kitchen set up  and it had an IG caption in the corner that said  “This is Fucking Disgusting”.
I  contacted her mom, and asked her about it, and  told her how uncomfortable it made me feel. 
It really broke my heart, she claims that the group was accident, that the video was sent to her group of friends as a joke, and the caption was about the kids saying they were eating chips with hot sauce. 
Still I’m utter uncomfortable about her sending videos/ pictures of my kids with this caption to unknown people, I get that this wasn’t  meant for me to be seen, and it was probably more like she was bored to be playing with babies.
She’s is suppose to come back in Wednesday for my 4yo birthday, but now her mom says she thinks we hate her... she says she’s gonna talk with her, but I honestly not sure what to do, just to leave it to her Mom or say something to her if she indeed comes over on Wednesday.

How do we stop the fighting?,"14yo step son and 15yo daughter. We've been living in the same house for just over a month and things are really bad. At first he would mess with with my daughter by talking loud when she's talking on the phone or knocking on her door just to annoy her. My husband told him just once to stop and he did. She was still upset though and outted him as gay to all their friends

He retaliated by spitting in one of her shower products. Obviously my daughter reached a breaking point and started hitting hitting him and I honestly can't blame her. 

This morning he spat in her lotion and she got up and pushed him down, I guess he hit his head on the corner of something because it he had a little cut that started bleeding. He (the much stronger one) basically just attacked my daughter, he didn't punch or kick but was basically ragdolling her to scare her. My husband wasn't home too see any of this.

I tried to keep them separated for the rest of day but wasn't thinking and called them both down for lunch, she stomped on his foot on purpose so he kicked her in the back of her leg really hard.

My son is upset with me because I forgot to care for his dog,"My son is 17. He has a 4 month old husky. (He bought this thing, not me.) My son worked from 10 to 6 today. Before he left he begged me to walk his husky and feed her. I said I would but I forgot and fell asleep. My son came home to see his dog whining in his kennel and soaked in pee. He fed his dog, let him out Inn the backyard to run around, then got him in the tub. Then he came to me upset and was like we didn't you do this blah blah I said I fell asleep and he went ""You could have at least let her out of the kennel you know I hate when she's in there"" and I said well I didn't want her pooping or peeing in the house while I slept. My son said but I've trained her so she wouldn't do that unless she needed to go really bad. I said it's not the end of the world the dog isn't fucking dead and my son said but you can't neglect a 4 month old puppy. I told him to watch your tone with me and stop talking back. He said ""I'm 17 not 14 and I'm just trying to have a conversation with you"" and I said ""Last time stop talking back"" and he shut his mouth. He walked off muttering stuff under his breath and I told him I'll be having his phone for the rest of the day since he wants to be disrespectful. My son asked me if he could walk to his girlfriends house down the street. I asked what for and he said because hes upset and genuinely needs to vent and can't do it over the phone since I took it. I said whatever, take a condom, and take your dog with you since you're so hellbent on her getting fresh air. I am very upset because I work extremely long 12 hour shifts as a nurse. Today was my off day and I just wanted to sleep. My body is tired and so is my brain. I deserved a break from everything.

Teen who won’t do anything,"Pretty sure I’m not the only person with this problem but I’m feeling hopeless so here I am, looking for Internet sympathy and advice. 

My oldest is 18.5. She won’t do anything, she has switched schools a few times and is currently working slowlllllly towards her GED. She’s in a Running Start type program where she can earn free college credits till she’s 21 but she’s only managed to get a couple credits in two years (? Lost track??) so now is “focusing” on the GED. 

She won’t do chores, she gets easily overwhelmed and will rather cry than just DO it, and I’m talking ONE or two chores. She will stand at the kitchen cabinet rooting through every glass complaining they are “dirty” but won’t just wash one by hand if it doesn’t meet her standards. She will tell me “by the way, the bathroom floor needs to be swept”. My response, “ok the broom is in the closet”. But she would never actually sweep. She’s rude to her sisters, constantly bossing them around and not letting them near her. She’s a terrible role model and causes her sisters a lot of distress. 

She’s NOT mean and she’s NOT a risk taker (meaning she’d never do drugs or drink or even cross the street without looking). She never yells or curses. She’s kind, caring, and artistic. She’s actually very smart. 

She does have anxiety and depression, but she won’t do anything about it. She won’t go to therapy, she will start and then stop going. She won’t take her meds, she is always waiting for the “right time”. For example now she has a new RX for an anti anxiety med that the bottle says to take in the morning. But she sleeps till 2 or 3pm so won’t take it since she’s never awake in the morning 🙄 She doesn’t like germs so now won’t work because of Covid, she won’t even entertain the idea of an at home job.

This started in 9th grade and has just gotten worse. I’m at a total loss and at my wits end. I love her but I don’t want her in my house anymore.

Parental disagreement about college and Covid-19.,"My oldest is entering her sophomore year of college. We live in Connecticut and her school is in California so the states have handled things differently but we have stayed up to date on the latest news. As of now her school plans to do mostly online courses with some labs being in person but campus will be open. She wanted to go back and we thought it made sense. She was pushed out of housing in order to make sure the freshman class was able to have socially distant dorms but will be renting an apartment right near campus with one of her roommates from last year and a friend she made doing a club sport. She wants to get back to campus and I feel like it's safer. My husband has an underlying medical condition and we don't want him to get sick so we have been strict with the kids about hanging out with friends. This way she can be around friends and not put my husband at risk. 

Her dad and (step)mom disagree. It is more expensive to send her than it would be to keep her home. They think sending her is pointless and having an open campus is just for the university to make money. For the apartment rent we will split the bill between us, them, and my daughter so it's not like they are going to be paying a crazy amount. I think mental health is as important as physical health and I don't think her sitting at home for another semester missing her friends is healthy. What would you guys do in this situation?",0,"Parental disagreement about college and Covid-19. My oldest is entering her sophomore year of college.

My husband has an underlying medical condition and we don't want him to get sick so we have been strict with the kids about hanging out with friends. This way she can be around friends and not put my husband at risk.   Her dad and (step)mom disagree. It is more expensive to send her than it would be to keep her home. They think sending her is pointless and having an open campus is just for the university to make money. For the apartment rent we will split the bill between us, them, and my daughter so it's not like they are going to be paying a crazy amount. I think mental health is as important as physical health and I don't think her sitting at home for another semester missing her friends is healthy. What would you guys do in this situation?",49,6,1425,273,Teenager 13-19 Years
Teenage angst? Or should I actually worry?,"Guys! I’ve gotten some really great advice from people here that has actually worked and I need some more! Lol. I know all these lockdowns and everything going on in the world right now has taken its toll on all of us. And I’m sure that bears some weight on what I’m about to say, but I am literally losing it here. 

When COVID-19 struck, my anxiety was already through the roof, as I’m sure was the case for many others. My 15 year old is severely asthmatic, so thing number one is keeping her safe. As she’s gotten older the asthma symptoms aren’t as frequent, but they’re no less severe when they do come around. She’s an athlete and being so active has actually seemed to help with it. 

She’s extremely social. She hates staying home. She’s involved with so much stuff at school that it literally kept her busy all day and she was so exhausted by the evenings she would be asleep by 9:00 every night. Straight A student, she’s on the cheerleading squad, she runs track, she does choir. 

Then enter lockdown. I knew it was going to take a toll on her. I knew things were going to change for her, and as much as I knew she understood, she started seeing her friends hanging out again and doing stuff as things started to open back up. 

Eventually, about a month or 6 weeks ago I started letting her hang out with a few friends whose parents I knew took it seriously and etc. But what I’ve noticed in the last month is a whole different kid. 

She’s always been a little mouthy since she was about 11 or so. I pick my battles. I don’t think every little eye roll needs a severe consequence. She does get grounded and gets her phone taken, etc., when the attitude turns into disrespect, for sure. 

So cheerleading is about to finally start back up THANK GOD because she needs that structure back. But lately, the attitude and the things she says have made me completely crazy. 

And it’s over the smallest injustices. Like not letting her and her boyfriend hang out in her bedroom with the door closed. What?! I allow them to hang out, he comes over, but he’s not allowed here when I’m not, she’s not allowed at his house when his parents are gone, they go to the park, they go get ice cream. Appropriate things for 15 year olds. He’s a nice kid and his family seems nice enough, but they’re teenagers and I’m not naive to teenagers making bad choices based on hormones and not brain cells. 

Or not letting her walk places alone. Or even walk with her friends after dark. She accuses me of watching too many episodes of Dateline. Ok, whatever. But these are safety concerns, nothing to do with me trusting or not trusting her or her age or anything else. Do you think any kidnapper ever that wanted to kidnap someone said, “Eh, she’s only 15. I’ll go find a 20 year old.” NO! It’s not safe ever. Not at 15, 25, or 50. Just not smart. 

And she cusses. A LOT. She’s never cussed at me, and really not that much in front of me. But when she’s on the phone, half the block can hear her. I try not to make a big deal, because my language isn’t pristine either. I could pull the “do as I say, not as I do,” line, but I don’t think that’s entirely fair. She’s threatened to run away. She says she hates me. She called me the worst mother on the planet yesterday because I made her put her seatbelt on 🙄 I always tell her to put her seatbelt on, but yesterday I guess she just didn’t want to. 

It’s almost like she’s regressed in maturity in the last 4 weeks. And it doesn’t help that I’m very reactive. And I know it, and she knows it. I really try hard not to be. I try to check myself. I try to say things like “I’m sorry you feel that way,” but it comes off more sarcastically than I intend it to. 

I’ve been told my whole life that I’m brash. I’ve never had that soft “mom” voice that you see in movies and stuff. I was a mom at 17. I’ve made plenty of mistakes along the way. As I’ve gotten older, obviously I’ve matured, changed my own behaviors, etc. 

But for the longest time I was like, no way is being a mom this easy. My kids have been easy-ish until now. They’ve generally listened, followed the rules, got good grades. Pushback here and there, but for the most part, pretty laid back kids. 

I realize my daughter is at an age where she is trying to break free and assert some independence, but she’s not an adult. She still needs guidance. And I’m torn between saying (not literally to her, but to myself) fine, go ahead and do that, because I know what happens and you’re going to see that I was right.... or, you’re the kid, I’m the parent, tough shit. 

I don’t believe in invalidating children’s feelings, but we all get frustrated and say things we wouldn’t say in a rational state. I’ve said to her the “because I said so” line. I’ve said, “I don’t need to give you a reason.” I’ve said, “My house, my rules.”  All those things my parents said to me growing up that I don’t necessarily know whether they still apply to kids today. 

I’ve read books. I’ve went to counseling. Kind of seemed like a waste of money. Maybe just not for us, I don’t know. I just wish I could remain calm and in control in the moment. I tell myself, “This is what I’m going to do.” And I don’t care about getting the last word or being right. She can make whatever smart ass comment she wants as I’m walking away, because I feel like I’m the adult and I need to be the mature one. So I feel like walking away when things are getting too heated is the right thing to do. That way I can cool off, she can cool off. 

If we’re somewhere that I can’t walk away, like in the car, I try to shoot her a warning and her favorite thing to say is, “I don’t care.”  Then I tell her, “You’re in control of what happens next.” Because I want the onus and accountability to be on her and her decision on whether to stop or keep going, because I feel like a lot of times she has tried to put the responsibility on me for punishing her and “ruining her life” because I took her phone or whatever else. And usually at first, I won’t engage or I’ll say, “I’m sorry you feel that way,” or “Okay {daughter}.”  

I try to tell myself that if I was a bad parent, she wouldn’t have any rules. I wouldn’t force her to take responsibility for her actions. I wouldn’t hold her accountable for her behavior. But I’m starting to feel like a complete failure. She doesn’t ask to do all that much and I actually don’t usually tell her no. She hangs out with the same group of kids all the time. I know the kids, I know their parents, and I don’t have any qualms with her hanging out with them or going to their house or whatever else. The things she does get told no about, is because it’s either inappropriate or unsafe for a teenage girl. That’s it. 

I may be slightly overprotective. Her asthma almost took her from me twice. Once when she was 8 and once when she was 13. ICU for days, on a machine, full respiratory arrest. And it was terrifying. And as a result, I’m sure I can be a little (or a lot at times) smothering and overprotective and I’ve tried to back off some. 

These are all things I realize about MYSELF as a person, and the one thing I wish I could develop better skills on is remaining calm IN THE MOMENT. And not reacting and engaging and regressing myself to a battle of wills with a 15 year old. Counting to 10 doesn’t work. Walking away works sometimes. It takes me less time to cool off than it does her, so I usually try to talk to her before she’s ready and I end up just leaving her be. It could be hours and sometimes days before she’s not mad at me anymore. And then I try to passively y’all to her about it, like if we’re driving somewhere and just casually bring it up. And she does apologize for things she’s said and so do I, but it seems less and less time is between the apologies anymore. 

I’ve literally said all this long-winded backstory to ask if anyone has anything that’s has worked for them that’s not some, “go take a walk, count to ten”. I expect 15 year olds to try their parents. But I also expect more of myself as the parent to not allow my 15 year old to control MY emotions with HER words.

At what age did/will you allow your kids to go on trips with their significant other?,"My oldest is 17. She'll be 18 in October and will be entering her senior year of high school this fall. That means next year she'll be heading out our door for college. She's a pretty responsible kid and has never given us much trouble. 

She started dating her boyfriend in October. They have known each other since elementary school. His family lives 3 doors down from us and their younger two boys and friends with my boys. Their daughter has babysat for our younger kids when my daughter couldn't. Overall I feel very comfortable with their family dynamics and the relationship. I am not naive enough to think that my daughter tells me everything but she tells me a lot. For example, she has told me that they thought about having sex but didn't because her boyfriend is leaving for college this fall and she doesn't want to do a long distance relationship. He ended up being okay with that but she was worried they would break up and confided in me.

His family invited my daughter on a beach trip in July. It's just them and their kids. They said their son will have his own room, my daughter will share with his sister, and their younger boys will share a room. They are super Catholic so I was surprised they offered but was okay with the trip given the details. My thoughts are that they are 18 and 17. If they want to have sex then they can probably find a better place than the room next to the parents on a family trip. My daughter's father disagrees. She splits her time between our house and her dad's but has been staying at her dad's because she wanted to see friends without risking her T1D brother. He is not completely against it but says he doesn't think it's a good idea and is inclined to say no. He said he would be more okay with it if she was 18 even though she'll be 18 in a few months.

Is 17 too young for this kind of trip?",0,"At what age did/will you allow your kids to go on trips with their significant other? My oldest is 17. She'll be in October and will be entering her senior year of high school this fall. That means next year she'll be heading out our door for college. She's a pretty responsible kid and has never given us much trouble.   She started dating her boyfriend in October. They have known each other since elementary school. His family lives doors down from us and their younger two boys and friends with my boys. Their daughter has babysat for our younger kids when my daughter couldn't. Overall I feel very comfortable with their family dynamics and the relationship. I am not naive enough to think that my daughter tells me everything but she tells me a lot. For example, she has told me that they thought about having sex but didn't because her boyfriend is leaving for college this fall and she doesn't want to do a long distance relationship. He ended up being okay with that but she was worried they would break up and confided in me.  His family invited my daughter on a beach trip in July. It's just them and their kids. They said their son will have his own room, my daughter will share with his sister, and their younger boys will share a room.

Kid likes speed dating her therapists,"Hi guys,

Need some advice. My step daughter experienced some trauma a few years ago and has since struggled with a number of things on top of just being a regular, moody teen. Right after the trauma, she started working with a therapist while with her mom, but then six months later, the therapist said it didn’t seem to be doing much for her and she just wanted to talk about school friends and their drama. Her mom stopped taking her, but then a few months later, we noticed she was experiencing more depression-like symptoms and we asked her mom to restart therapy sessions. Our daughter shared after a bit that she didn’t feel comfortable talking to the therapist, and stopped going again. 

Fast forward to six months later, and she kept asking if her dad and I could find her a therapist, so we did, back in January. First few months were great, she overcame a lot of topics, but now she’s feeling like she can’t really open up to her therapist anymore, and even when she’s sad, she feels like she can’t bring it up. 

I’m a bit frustrated her therapist just keeps swiping the card and not telling us she isn’t getting as much from our daughter as she used to. BUT, I’m here to discuss that my daughter has now asked to go to a new therapist. 

I have seen one therapist sporadically for the last 8 years. I haven’t been in over 9 months, and just pop in when I need to vent or unload things, but he and I really clicked. I can’t imagine doing that if I didn’t click with someone. 

Is it weird to switch therapists often? Do you think she just needs to find the right one? Tonight she even said she feels like after a while she just can’t talk to the therapists anymore, but I worry they’re losing the history and the progress. 

Anyone else experience this?",0,"Kid likes speed dating her therapists Hi guys,  Need some advice.

15 year old son spiralling downward again,"My 15 year old son has had a lot of bad behavior over the past few years. It started with attitude and being disrespectful to us. Then, it quickly escalated into a bigger mess. He started skipping a few classes and sneaking out occasionally, which quickly turned into flat out missing school and attempting to run away. We punished him, but that made him escalate his behavior (eg stealing our money to buy burner phones when his phone was taken away) Therapy didn't help because he would lie and say that we were abusing him (which is not true at all) to avoid taking responsibility for his actions and to make us look like the bad guys.

Last summer, after we busted him for running away, my son threatened to commit suicide. We took him to a psychiatric hospital, where he was observed and evaluated. When he got evaluated, he was diagnosed with ODD and some anxiety disorders, as opposed to his previous diagnosis of ADHD. We got referred to an ODD specialist and had him put on ODD medication. These things helped in a major way. He stopped sneaking out. He stopped stealing. He started attending school regularly. 

However, yesterday I got a call from his teacher saying that he had not completed any homework since the end of April. When I asked him about it, he pretended that he didn't know what was happening and refused to tell the truth. Eventually he admitted that he did not do his work because he was tired of school and thought that it was stupid that he had to do his work. We spent much of last night fighting and arguing about this because he refused to do anything. He even attempted to run away. Now he is finally completing his work. 

I can't believe we are back here again. We have been nothing but loving and supportive towards him, and we really thought that things were looking up, only to find out that we had been lied to and that his bad behaviour is returning. I have no idea what to do now, please help.",0,"year old son spiralling downward again My year old son has had a lot of bad behavior over the past few years.

Am I crazy or are 16 and 15 reasonable ages to stay home alone overnight?,"My oldest (18) will be going to college this year. Because of Covid they are limiting the amount of people who can be with the student to help them move in. We originally intended to bring our two boys along. Our older son is 16 and our youngest will turn 15 a few days before we leave. 

Without traffic it's about 4 hours to get to her school. We thought we would leave early that morning, get her settled in, and then my husband and I would head to a hotel to stay overnight. The next day, depending on the shape of the city at that point, I would like to spend some time touring the area before heading home late afternoon. So we would leave around 5am on move in day and then get home the following day around 8pm-ish. I relayed this plan to my sister and she thought it sounded crazy. She said she would come over with her daughter and watch the boys but I told her that wasn't necessary. She is more than welcome to come by and check on them but I don't think they need an overnight babysitter.

Teens &amp; Food - anyone else run across this?,"I have a 15 year old girl who is healthy, not overweight but... eats every single snack or treat in the house as fast as she can, without regard for others. Has anyone else experienced this?

Some examples - I got a jar of nutella for everyone, she ate half of it herself before anyone else got any. I bought a container of cottage cheese and got one serving - in less than a day she'd eaten more than half. I buy chips, she snarfs them, and on and on.

I've tried her having her own treat jar. I've tried buying a big box of individual snacks and each kid gets one. I've tried getting her her own big bag of something and requesting she leaves everyone else's stuff alone. Nothing works.

Now, I know teenagers have high metabolisms. I serve three good meals a day, and popcorn and the fruit bowl are always available any time. But it seems like if there are any snacks at all, or cheese, or any fruit that we don't get any week - basically any treat at all - she will eat and eat until it's gone without thinking, ""there are other people in the house, I shouldn't eat their share."" As well, she'll often not finish her dinner, which she needs for the protein, veggies, complex carbs, etc, saying she's ""not hungry"" only to raid the cupboard later.

Dad is letting 15yr old drink alcohol.,"Family is me-mum (38f), dad (47m) and daughters 13&amp;15. So we have had shared care, 50/50, for 11yrs. No courts, just a family agreement. More recently the kids have had more autonomy over where they want to be. As it happens, oldest daughter enjoys time with dad and they share sporting hobbies, so this is fine. 

Then my daughter tells me she got drunk. I was taken aback and was pretty shocked but let her keep talking. She had 6 drinks so yes, fair to say she would have been. Dad got her the drinks and was with her and some of their friends and his home. This conversation happened in a moment when she dropped by to grab something, so I thought I would address it when I had some time to think and decide how to approach it because honestly I was in shock but we had guests and she was with a friend. When I did approach it the next day she burst into tears and told me that I am why she feels depressed and it’s no big deal and to leave her alone. So then I text dad to say we need to talk about this. His response, “I was with her the whole time and was talking to her”. Talking about what, I don’t know. Turns out it’s happened more than once but possibly not to that extreme. So, he lets her know that I have contacted him. She freaks out and wants to basically live there. Tells me that I should talk to her, not him. 
I made it clear that I was unhappy with this, that it is about her health and well-being and the relationship with alcohol that concerns me, we have a history of alcoholism on both sides and not only that, I’m also her parent, i will step in when I am concerned. I got advice from my therapist who suggested finding an opportunity to talk to her alone, addressing the facts of alcohol on teenage brains etc. Was a bit uncertain of this was the best approach but was readying myself for a conversation. A couple of days later I see her, it’s her birthday, not ideal for a heavy conversation but assumed we had the weekend and I would bring it up. She decides to get picked up early so time was cut short. Next day she posts a meme on social media about alcohol, so I text her to ask her what is happening, I feel worried. Again, will be coming to collect some stuff, would like to live with dad. I feel like my options are talk to dad again, risk damaging our relationship by doing this and/or involve authorities. Or try and find a way to talk to her again.. I’m not sure and I feel like any of the above will bring on more anger but clearly I can’t drop it. Just feel very stuck and afraid.

Again, will be coming to collect some stuff, would like to live with dad. I feel like my options are talk to dad again, risk damaging our relationship by doing this and/or involve authorities. Or try and find a way to talk to her again.. I’m not sure and I feel like any of the above will bring on more anger but clearly I can’t drop it. Just feel very stuck and afraid. I have always felt that I have little power with her and her dad, she will always side with him despite him having warped views such as not allowing her to post certain dances on social media, basically slut shaming, but feels ok about her drinking?

It might be time for a restraining order.,"I was outside at 3:30 am looking through my car for a missing iPAD.  I've had issues with my 16 yr old daughter sneaking out of the house with her (now ex) boyfriend in the middle of the night, and the device being missing is worrisome.  As I was looking through the car, I kept hearing rustling near the house.  I thought it was an armadillo that I had seen a few nights ago going under my house.  I was making loud ""TSSSSST!"" hissing noises to try to scare it off.  For some reason I decided to say out loud, ""Ok, come on out.""  And someone stood up.  It was the 18 year old boyfriend.  We had forbade him coming here and forbade her from speaking to him over three months ago.  It's a long story, but in addition to him coming to help her sneak out frequently, he called an uber and helped her run away and hide in his back yard.  His dad is an explosive dangerous person who has made threats against my wife and I stating that we are ruining his life by my daughter and his son talking on the phone at 3am and because his son had to take a trip to planned parenthood to get tested for STIs when my daughter tested positive for chlamydia.  His dad accused my wife of distributing drugs to minors and made claims that he would report her to the DEA and other people that he knew.  This guy apparantly pulled a gun on his own son the night my daughter ran away, but he also said loud enough for her to hear that he was going to blow her brains out.  The son confirmed this in a facebook messenger conversation with my daughter afterwards.  


Fucker was in my yard at 3:30 in the morning.  I've never cussed anyone out.  I may have woken the neighbors I was so loud.  I know better than to touch anyone and was satisfied with him speeding off as I tried to photograph him and then calling the police.  He's lucky I'm not any other human being.  


 I eventually found the iPad in my 6 yr old son's room under his pillow.  Sneaky... but no evidence in browser history or running/installed apps on any devices that she's been communicating with him.  


One time this fucker was inside my house around this hour.  But that was back when my daughter and him were communicating.   


My father-in-law is an attorney.  So far he has advised us to just ignore the boy and his hothead of a father.  But I do not carry the same confidence.

I’m (39F) concerned about how 16F is coming out of the closet...,"First of all, I’m bi. So this isn’t some kind of “straight girl not understanding her gay kid” issue. 

My daughter is bi. She told me about 6 years ago. Obviously it wasn’t a big deal and it didn’t change anything. She only told her older sister, myself and her dad. She tried telling friends but they recoiled like she was some sort of toxic monster and it destroyed the relationships.

She is known for doing “things” for attention that are over the top and only last a few weeks. I’ve posted about them before. (The last one was fake stuttering. Within a few days of my post two of my other kids called her out about the stuttering and she hasn’t done it since.)

The. Next. Day. Suddenly she’s out and proud. Fantastic. I love a supportive coming out story. Here’s the problem...

She is shoving it down absolutely everyone’s throats. She hung a pride flag. She changed a sign in her room to a quote about being gay. Every profile picture on absolutely everything has some sort of LGBT photo or reference. It’s EVERYWHERE. If it can have a rainbow, it’s now got a rainbow. She works it into every conversation. She captions every photo with some sort of flag, rainbow, quote... something. 

All of her friends are also posting photos of her saying something like “my bi bestie” and just things that wouldn’t normally be posted.

I’m genuinely nervous this is one of her “attention” things. Not being bi, but the way she’s going about coming out.

My other concern is that where we live, it isn’t “ok” to be different, especially gay. To which obviously I take massive issue with. But my fear is she doesn’t understand the hatred in the world and shoving being gay in their faces when they don’t understand isn’t going to go well.

She has been granted dozens of scholarships, most of which are religion based - I can see those being taken away. I won’t go into all of the other concerns but they all center around her screaming about being gay when it isn’t necessary and her accomplishments being diminished over it.

I feel like I need to say “Be who you are, you’re fine... but the way you’re doing it is problematic...” Opinions?

TL;DR My bi daughter is shoving being bi down everyone’s throats and I’m concerned because she does things like this for attention and she doesn’t understand the hatred in the world. I’m concerned about how it will affect her. 

And, just to clarify - I don’t care that she’s coming out. I LOVE that she’s comfortable. It’s HOW she’s doing it. She is also not claiming to be bi for attention, she’s being SUPER EXTRA about it for attention.

"Anyone else have a lonely teen, or a teen for whom things just aren't working out?","I'm on a throwaway for a number of reasons.

My daughter is 16/F, but operates on most levels like an adult. For the most part, we're pretty much done parenting. She has a lot of friends but not a particular group. In the past school year she had two close friends, one of whom she has decided to diplomatically ghost for a number of reasons, and the other her best friend since first grade, a nice girl, but a little bit behind our daughter in the way of independence and with overprotective parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our daughter has been driving for months but passed her test a little over a month ago and is waiting for her license in the mail, it was a rough year for everyone and she was looking forward to being able to drive her best friend to go do mundane things and just have fun doing what teenagers do. She invited best friend to go get brownie mix at the grocery store and then go over to bake at her grandma's and initially her mother said she could, but then bestfriend's mother went back on it and decided she wouldn't allow bestfriend to be driven by my daughter since she just got her license. My daughter said she's not mad because it's precedented behavior by best friends mom, but she's disappointed because she doesn't have anything to look forward to and there's nothing good going on in her life anymore.

"13yo keeps stealing, would it be a bad idea to steal something of hers?","Hey guys, on mobile so sorry for any issues. Basically what the title says. My 13 year old has been going through a really rough patch the last couple of months. She's stolen money and weed from our roommate, and nicotine vapes/vape cartridges from me. She was grounded for a full month over the theft from my roommate, and we forced her to give everything back to him and apologize. 

So last night I forgot to bring my pack of cartridges to my room when I went to bed, but my partner thought it would be a good idea to leave them there to see if one would come up missing. Sure as shit, it was gone this morning. No one in the house uses the same vape device that I do, so that rules out everyone but my kid. 

She will not fess up to it, we've searched her room and came up empty, but we've searched her room soany times in the past month it wouldn't be surprising if she hid it somewhere else in the house. 

Would we be wrong to ""steal"" something out of her room and tell her we don't know what she's talking about when she asks about it? She has to learn a lesson here, and it doesn't seem like anything else is working. We don't want to make things worse, since she is/has gone through a lot in her 13 years, but we can't just let stealing or nicotine addiction slide. 

If it's a bad idea, please let me know. If you have a better idea, please share. We're lost. TIA!

Edit : We have removed her phone, it was taken for a month for the first theft, and we've taken it again now. We've added to her chore load, we've been spending more time together as a family in case this is a cry for more attention, we've had long serious discussions about how stealing can and will ruin her life, we've had a police officer come and talk to her, we've had her school resource officer come and talk with her.

Taking in my nephew (14M) who has had little to no structure. Where do I start implementing structure but also showing him the love and attention he needs?,"My husband and I have decided to take in his 14yo nephew in July and more than likely into his Freshmen year of High School. This will be a 1,700 mile move for him to a different part of the country.

Long story short as how we got here. Bio Dad who has never given a cent in child support has gone from hardly in the picture to hasn't responded to my nephews messages and leaves him on ""read"" for 4 months (since he won a lawsuit). Step Dad has taken a second wife in another city. Mom is emotionally not taking it well which I understand and only focuses on her 2 toddlers. The house they live in is in rough shape. 

My nephew has a wonderful heart but has no drive to do anything. He struggles a lot in school and lies about school work/completing chores. He goes to sleep at 5am playing video games and wakes up at 2pm most days during the summer. I feel like his mom has tried to enforce rules but that doesn't last long since she is tired with everythingelse. They don't have a particularly good relationship. The one thing he does do very well is take care of his two younger brothers. 

I teach students his age but I know being a guardian is totally different. Where do I start as far as fostering good habits like a sleep schedule or showering? Then bigger issues like responsibilities and respect. I already love this kid and was actively in his life for 3 years before we moved. I want to give him the love and support he deserves but not be a push over.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",0,"Taking in my nephew (14M) who has had little to no structure. Where do I start implementing structure but also showing him the love and attention he needs?

I feel like his mom has tried to enforce rules but that doesn't last long since she is tired with everythingelse. They don't have a particularly good relationship. The one thing he does do very well is take care of his two younger brothers.   I teach students his age but I know being a guardian is totally different. Where do I start as far as fostering good habits like a sleep schedule or showering? Then bigger issues like responsibilities and respect. I already love this kid and was actively in his life for years before we moved. I want to give him the love and support he deserves but not be a push over.  Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",155,28,1506,288,Teenager 13-19 Years
I don't know how to deal with my daughter's jealousy of my new wife.,"So I've been married to Lily for two years now and it's been four years since my divorce and my fourteen year old daughter is not handling it well. She uses feminism as a justification to attack Lily for the way she dresses, not working, how she plans on raising our daughter, and things came to a head the other day when Lily said she hopes our baby is into cheerleading and Nora said she hopes that her sister doesn't have to lay on her back for money. This is obviously completely inappropriate and she lost her phone for a month.

I'm just at a loss. Lily is 27 so still relatively young and just absolutely gorgeous. I don't know if that plays a role in it. Nora has expressed discomfort with Lily wearing revealing clothing, so I don't know if she is jealous. I do encourage Nora in all of her interests including feminism, but Lily and I have chosen a much more traditional route. In the heat of the moment I banned Nora from talking about feminism. I know that was wrong and we'll have a long talk tomorrow but I'm not going to allow anyone to speak to my wife like that. 

Nora's mother makes it very clear that she doesn't like Lily and tells Nora inappropriate details about how our marriage ended (Lily wasn't involved) but it's gotten to the point where I struggle to have a relationship with my daughter, because she is currently attacking my wife.",0,"I don't know how to deal with my daughter's jealousy of my new wife.

How do you handle a situation where a teenage boy forces himself on your daughter?,"Daughter lied to me the other day and visited a boy instead of a girl like she had stated.  Typical of all teens, so don't judge harshly for that, we all did it.  Possibly my fault for being way overprotective. However she allowed herself to get in a place where she was alone with said boy.  He obviously took advantage of the situation and tried to force himself on her repeatedly.  He also repeatedly took her phone away from her when he thought she was trying to message someone to come help her.  She said that she found out while there he was into drugs( selling, using etc) and that she saw him put something in her water while he thought her attention was elsewhere.  Thank God she was able to get a message out to someone to intervene before things went way south.  Curious how a parent handles this.  Before all of the dads out there say kill him, just know that I do love my daughter far more then my freedom and this is a thought that passed through my head.

My (21) year old sister (13) sneaking out of the house,"Tonight my barely turned 13 year old sister snuck out of the house. I woke up in the middle of the night  (4am) and noticed that a camera sensor was set off and I saw my sister sneak outside the driveway. I called her and she said she was downstairs and was coming up to bed. I double check the house and she’s nowhere and I call her and say she needs to come home right now. She comes home and she and two others girls are in a car with and unlicensed 15 YO boy (he doesn’t talk to me and sped away when I tried to). I talked to her and she said they went to the gas station to get snacks. My brother and I lectured her for about 20 minutes and told here were telling her parents in the morning. I’m at a loss of words because my younger sister has always seemingly been honest and smart enough not to put herself in these situations. Tonight she put herself in an incredibly vulnerable position, sneaking out during covid, during high riots, in a city with a crazy high crime and homicide rate, with an unlicensed driver at 4am. I’m shaking at the idea of what could have happened. My brother and I talked for awhile and are now debating whether or not to tell her separated parents. They are historically not good parents and handle things terribly. My brother and I actually came to help make the household more healthy and to try to help my father become better at being a better leader/father figure this summer. I don’t know if her parents will bring anything to the table if we tell them atm.

Is it better to strengthen our relationship and build trust by me not telling her parents or tell her parents and risk her being dishonest with me in the future?

Lonely 13 year old daughter and lack of confidence,"Hi everyone, 

I am looking for advice with my 13 year old daughter. She is an incredibly smart , beautiful, funny , artistic kid . Unfortunately, she does not see any of these qualities in herself and is painfully shy . I won’t go into too many details but I had her quite young (21) and was married to her dad until she was about 6 . Her dad was quite abusive towards me and had absolutely no interest in being a parent . Unfortunately, after I eventually left , he refused to see her unless I paid his rent ( which I did for a while but could not sustain while raising a child on my own ) . Obviously that was quite hurtful for her and impossible to explain . I have tried counselling for her but she absolutely hates it and will refuse to talk . Whenever I try to talk to her about anything emotional, she totally shuts down . About a year after we left I actually started to see a really positive change in her , she was starting to socialize, doing well in school , taking part in extra-curricular activities.  Last year ( grade 6) I noticed she started to withdraw from her friends and only really hung out with one other girl . They seemed to get along well and had fun together so I wasn’t hugely concerned. This year they started middle school and something happened between them to cause a falling out . I am not sure of the details because whenever I ask her she gets really upset and does not want to talk . It breaks my heart because now I just see her becoming more and more withdrawn . She is too shy to try to make any other friends and just has no confidence in herself at all . Before the lockdown happened I had her enrolled in an art class with 2 or 3 other kids which she seemed to like but she never spoke to the other kids . Whenever I had meetings with her teachers they would tell me she does not talk at all during the school day . At home she is really talkative with me ( as long as it’s not a sensitive subject ) and will joke around , dance, etc but as soon as we step out of the house it all changes .  I try my best to fill the role of both friend and mom but I am not 13 years old and I can only fulfill that so much while still being the parent . I am worried because now that she’s been out of school for so long I feel she will continue to regress socially . I don’t expect her to suddenly become super popular and confident but it would make my heart so full to even see her interacting with one other kid her age . Does anyone have any experience with being shy at that age ? Any advice on how I can help her to make friends and become a little more confident in who she is ?

Need help parenting a teen through a crisis,"Hi folks, I have kind of a difficult problem and not sure if this is the right group. I'm going to have to write some long backstory to explain what I'm dealing with here, so please bear with me. 

Backstory:
I (F24) had a really rocky relationship with my mother in my teens. More so I think than the usual teen drama. My mother is an alcoholic and is extremely unpredictable, emotionally abusive, sometimes physically as well. I got out of there when I was 16 (went to live with my father and grandparents 6+ hours away), and have slowly been able to rebuild that relationship with my mom with distance. I had a baby at just barely 18, and my mom has, out of wanting to know her grandchild,  been on ""best behavior"" around me for the most part since.

I still have 2 younger sisters (currently 14 and 15) living with her, though,  and they haven't been so lucky. They've gotten to live with her through a long, stressful, abusive (from both sides) marriage, the aftermath of that divorce, 3 suicide attempts,  multiple involuntary mental hospital stays,  the list goes on. Their father (different from mine) had been supporting them as much as he could, but financially was unable to try for custody. In 2018, he got in a terrible motorcycle accident and passed away at 39 years old.

IMO, both of my sisters are in extreme emotional distress, and dealing with it in very different ways. For this, I am going to focus on the older one (turns 15 in 2 weeks). Let's call her K. My mother initially tried to take my sisters to therapy after their father died.  But right out of her playbook from when I was a teen, she took them to her therapist and insisted on being present, so that the kids couldn't really talk freely or bad mouth her. I think they went a handful of times, but obviously wasn't very productive. Younger sister (P) copes by retreating into a shell and watching tv all day to ignore her feelings. K on the other hand has always been more social.  Even before her father died, she was very angry at my mother for her suicide attempts, and would do everything possible to avoid being home. She'd go to her dad's for the most part, but now that he's gone, she's mostly been staying with friends. 

Current events:
It came out last week now that the friend K has been staying with for the most part has ""relaxed"" parents who basically let them go do whatever they want. So the two of them have been going out and partying, getting drunk, and having sex. For K, I think a lot of this is her trying to escape from the stress of my mother's issues compounded by the death of her father, which she's never really been given an opportunity to process.

My mother, I think, did actually take some good steps with K. She got her to a gynecologist to get her examined/tested for STDs, and also get her on birth control. 

But K is clearly spiraling out of control. Mom called me to talk about it, and I suggested that K come out and stay with me for at least a few weeks. The idea is that distance from her friends and that situation will help her breathe and reset.  We also figured that she might be more open to talking with me than our mother. K is on board with any plan that gets her away from mom for an extended period, so I'll be meeting my mom half way to pick her up next weekend.

My problem is that I am no therapist, and I truly think that is what K needs. Being that she's underage, I don't think I'll be able to take her anywhere while she's here with me. So I just wanted to pick the brains of you all. How can I best help her?  My instinct is to just let her talk to me when she's ready and let her tell her story, no judgement. But past that, I have no idea what to do or say. I'm pretty young myself, and in the grand scheme of things, really not that much more experienced in life than she is. I just desperately want to help her in any way I can.

I talked to her on the phone yesterday, and she's already saying ""yea it'll be nice to see you, but it'll all just be the same when I go back"". She said some other things too that make me fear that she could be having suicidal thoughts as well. 

Any advice anyone can give me here would be super appreciated!!",0,"Need help parenting a teen through a crisis Hi folks, I have kind of a difficult problem and not sure if this is the right group.

How to stop mother being so utterly hateful.,"So here’s the thing all I do is try to make my family happy. But I don’t know what’s the matter. I treat my family with respect and I’m never hateful to them. Now we have disagreements but I am a very relaxed person I never raise my tone it’s never physical and overall it’s usually just common disagreements. That’s with the rest of my family. However, my mother is a different type, she’s always hateful to me calls me an asshole calls me a lazy fat ass which I’m 6’5 and weigh 180 pounds which is pretty normal. Overall she just seems to cuss at me and I’m getting really damn tired of it. Anytime I bring up a valid point against her it’s always I gave birth to you and you live in this damn house for free and then I have to tell her that’s a normal family works. And she always says how I’m gonna be a failure in life probably flunk out of college which I don’t see how because I’ve never done drugs, alcohol and I make straight A’s. She always brings up when I say you need to calm down and stop screaming how her mother was so much worse than her and how I am not even compared to her mother. And anytime I would also try to tell her that what she’s saying is hateful, all she does is give a shit eating grin and smirked at me and say shut up, Another thing is when I talk to her if she’s going to relay the information to my dad or something which my dad is a very kind man sure relate like I was fucking either screaming at her or saying it like a total douche bag and being a total cocky asshole which I don’t I literally never raise my tone to her or anybody else. And when we go anywhere either she doesn’t invite me, Or she acts like a big brother having to drag his sister along to go meet with friends which if you’ve been in those shoes you know you don’t want to. But I am the only one she is like this towards in the family I have tried lots of approaches I’ve tried going face-to-face I’ve played the passive game I really don’t know how to get her to treat me like her own freaking child. She also goes off on how I don’t do jack shit around this house, and how in one year I’ll be moving to college and then my lazy ass can do it then. Which isn’t true I do everything they ask the first time and I do it right so I don’t have to go back and do it again now there’s a couple times like I’m not gonna be able to do everything at the speed of light, but everything does get done within a small timeframe. At this point now when I leave for college I will probably never come back unless this gets fixed I will never see her again she will never see her grandchildren and I’m dead serious about it I really don’t understand why she’s so hateful to me 24/7 and then she says how hateful I am to her when in reality I’m always pretty nice to her because I’m trying to have a good relationship with my mother. But I’m open to any and all suggestions because at this point I don’t know what it is.

Which isn’t true I do everything they ask the first time and I do it right so I don’t have to go back and do it again now there’s a couple times like I’m not gonna be able to do everything at the speed of light, but everything does get done within a small timeframe. At this point now when I leave for college I will probably never come back unless this gets fixed I will never see her again she will never see her grandchildren and I’m dead serious about it I really don’t understand why she’s so hateful to me 24/and then she says how hateful I am to her when in reality I’m always pretty nice to her because I’m trying to have a good relationship with my mother. But I’m open to any and all suggestions because at this point I don’t know what it is.

18yo stepson with issues and very protective mother,"As the title says I have an 18 year old stepson with some serious issues, his mother is extremely protective and refuses to be strict with him on any level... basically allowing him to do whatever he wants to do. He has a learning disability and basically dropped out of high school at 17 and has been living with us doing whatever he pleases for the past year. He has threatened suicide, and has used that as a form of manipulation with his mother. He has no self control and very little common sense about basic worldly things. I have been his father for 15 years and his biological father has not been in the picture at all. I'm at a loss as to what to do, he has done things recently that make no sense and I can't wrap my head around them, Including admitting to molesting his cousin 5 years ago and just recently bragged to his cousin's boyfriend about it. Obviously he has some serious issues going on. 

I'm just at a loss as to what should happen. He isn't equipped to deal with the world and will undoubtedly land in jail one way or another without some sort of intervention. I have a 14yo daughter (his half-sister) in the house that I am now concerned about.

His mom doesn't know how to deal with this and for the moment is letting it go... shes currently in full mama bear mode.

My 14 year old daughters step mom is trying to make her an Instagram influencer.,My 14 year old daughter stays with her Dad and his long time girlfriend during the summers. Last summer while she was there they allowed her to get an Instagram which I told her she could keep if she let me follow her and her posts weren’t inappropriate. She got around 350 followers over the next year mostly friends from school and family etc. This summer while staying with her dad she asked her “influencer” step mom to help her get more followers. They started posting slightly racy photos of my daughter and sure enough in one week she gained 1000 followers. I have raised my suspicions with everyone and everyone has just laughed me off and told me I’m jealous that my 14 year has more followers than me. Honestly I’m terrified and I don’t know what to do. Her dad has only been in her life the past two years and it terrifies me that he seems to love having a beautiful daughter he can parade around and overly sexualize.

My grandma told my mom I’m having sex,"Hey guys. I’m an 18 year old female from a single immigrant (strict, Caribbean) mom. This morning I was on the phone with my grandma talking about birth control. And I was just telling her I’ve been on it for a year and a half and she was asking me if I started having sex then and I said no not then. Long story short I guess she assumes I AM NOW currently having sex. (Which I am)

I’ve been with my bf for 8months and we started having sex about four months ago. He’s my second boyfriend but my first. 

Furthermore, when my mother came home from work today she said out of nowhere “I heard you’re in stuff” in Haitian creole (basically insinuating sex). Then I just laughed it off and thought nothing of it. Then we were talking about our days whatever and I ask what did u mean by I’m in stuff. And then she said “I would hope you would come to me about it first but I think you’re starting too too early. I thought I could trust you. I thought I could trust you to make the right decisions but I guess not.” And I was just puzzled. So I replied “what do you mean?” And she said nothing, nothing. 

Anyways I’m pretty sure my gramma told mY CRZY STRICT MOM I’m having sex with my bf. 

I would like to know how can I address my backstabbing grandma because I never said those words and I never asked her to spread the word. Additionally, is there a way I can lie my way out of the truth to my mom, if so please advice. If not what should I do?",0,"My grandma told my mom I’m having sex Hey guys.

"My 13 yo is expressing ideas of self harm and ""hating"" his younger sibling.","My kids are five years apart, my son being the oldest of the two. Friday, he starting making statements like ""if I get sick (COVID-19), don't try to save me."" I got a hold of his counselor right away, trying to be subtle about it, and asked to have a meeting right away. While I waited for a response, my son and I had a lengthy conversation about how not only would I fight tooth and nail if he ever got sick, but that effort doesn't just apply to times of crisis. We're always there, and we can listen or direct him to someone who he feels comfortable talking to (just in case he doesn't want to mention some things with us), and that's completely okay. At the end of that conversation, we got down to him not seeing his self-worth. Told his counselor everything as soon as I got a chance, and started going through text lines and such for my son reach out to. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as he got out of his meeting with the counselor, whom he confides in pretty well, he was anxious and wanted me to hear what the meeting was about from the counselor, not himself. Finally, he just said that he hated his sister, and that hanging out with her, or even her presence in the room, was a stress for him. He's never tried to harm her, he just really wants to avoid her altogether. Not only that, but he wants to kind of monopolize the time with us and exclude her whenever possible. His counselor doesn't seem to think of this as an urgent matter, and let me know that he'll be calling me tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I let my son know that I'm not mad at him for what he is feeling. He always brings it up when it comes to his sister wanting to hang out with him, or even talk to him, so I don't want to facilitate a manipulative behavior in him. We were kind of redirecting her to keep them separated, but this cannot go on forever. And, she's going to question why they went from close and laughing all of the time to Frozen-sisters status in a matter of  weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months back, his school showed the dangers of school shootings and how to detect a student that may be of concern, how to report to an adult and try to get anyone in need of help to the right people, news reports of the school shootings this year, etc. This was the first trigger. He would text or call my husband and myself (we're both teachers) every chance he got. He would panic if one of us left the house for groceries, appointments, anything. This is when we started taking him to counseling. Now, though, the new triggers are the current pandemic and quarantine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seriously not sure what to do, I'm losing sleep, and seriously just slowly taking things that he could possibly use for self-harm or any kind of attempt. As for his sister, she's pretty oblivious at the moment. She's just concerned whenever he seems to want to be alone, but then ends up hovering over him and trying to make him smile. He has warm-line numbers, and all options open to him. I've even told him that if his thoughts get really dark, or he's worried or scared, just to come to us and ask to talk to someone, no questions asked. What else can I do? We're trying to get him back onto a routine that he had before (he does well with check-lists and schedules), and that seems to help a little. But, what of a relapse?

Teenagers and sleeping in. Do you guys limit how late they are allowed to sleep in?,"I have two teens and two toddlers. We live in a split level house.

I could notice that my daughter had gotten noticeably thinner, but didn't think much of it, as she always ate in front of me. A few weeks ago, she suddenly collapsed in the middle of the living room. COVID has cleared up where I live, so we obviously took her to the hospital. She was showing symptoms of dehydration, malnutrition, and more.

Right before my daughter left for the center, she screamed at my wife for sending her there.

She is at a friend's house doors down from my home. i'm worried about the chaos that is about to erupt because she won't leave. If she refuses to come back so she can fly home, I'll have to get the police involved. I'll have to report her as a runaway. This will cause friction with my neighbor. The bottom line is its her mom or children services. I don't want to cause anymore damage to her, but she is tearing my family apart. She is an absolute nightmare. If I had known the problems taking her in would cause, I would have never taken her in. In the end, I'll look like the bad guy. I feel like I'm in a bad movie, The Good Son or something. Also, I didn't mention that the mom is diagnosed bipolar. I think the year old may be too, given the things she says and her actions. ",36,9,1393,276,Teenager 13-19 Years
Is there any way to get a kid to push themselves a little bit harder in school?,"My 16 year old is a good student but we all know that he would be doing even better if he applied himself a little more. He finished his sophomore year with a GPA of 3.85 out of a 4.0. He admitted that he could have done better if he pushed a little more. For example, in one of his classes he would have had a 97 if he just did a short assignment the teacher assigned every week. All he had to do was read one chapter and answer a couple of questions. He didn't do any of them because he said he knew he could still get an A in the class without it. He ended up with a 92 instead. I am not upset with him. I know he still worked hard but it annoys me a little that such a simple assignment got blown off because he didn't feel like spending 20 minutes doing work he thought was pointless. Freshman year we had some issues with him trying to use his disability as a free pass to slack off. His teachers and sports coaches were being way too lenient with him because he is Deaf and it took me going up to the school to get them to hold him to a higher standard. I know some things will be harder for him but we never let him use that as an excuse. He has an interpretor for class and his teachers print out notes or upload them online so he doesn't have to copy notes. He is entitled to accommodations but wr try to limit it to things he truly needs. 

I don't want to punish him or anything. He is doing well and I am not going to punish him for having a A- average. I am hoping this will sort itself out. Next year he will be taking 1 AP course and 2 honors courses so I am hoping that he'll naturally have to push himself more but this year he took 2 honors courses and found them to be easy. He didn't push himself in those courses either and still ended up with a 92 in honors English and a 89 in honors European History. 

I want him to push himself because I think college is going to be a shock to the system if he's used to not studying or trying and I don't want to pay for him to flunk out freshman year. I also want him to have plenty of options for college. My oldest just graduated high school and will be starting college this fall. Her GPA was pretty much perfect, she founded and was president of a club, she did a varsity sport and was involved with other clubs that held competitions. Yet she was still rejected for her top school.

Parents who choose to have an only child. Do you regret it?,"I had mine very young (19) and even though he means the world to me I find myself fantasizing about focusing on my career and studies first before deciding to have kids. Our son is much loved and he’s making me proud every single day because he’s everything that I wasn’t as a child. I made sure he got everything that I was lacking growing up. 

So basically the past decade or so friends and family have been asking me whether we’re going to try another one. I mostly shrug it off because I’m not interested in going through another pregnancy (mine was hard) and taking care of another child (It’s a huuuuuge of responsibility as you know!) whereas I see people around me having kids every year and they don’t seem to care about their kids future (I say this because I know that they’re not financially stable/jobless and they barely make ends meet), they’re not giving their kids enough attention because they’re too busy worrying about money and the kids end up neglected and addicted to gadgets.

I’m a parent but I actually think that many parents mess up their kids. Adverse childhood experiences stay with you and you don’t get over it even when you’re 50!!! (I’m not 50 but I see a lot of messed up adults). My son is wonderful but I still don’t know how he’s going to turn out as an adult! I’m afraid that I might mess him up because I give him too much affection and not enough rules!! This is one of the reasons why I think it’s best that I shouldn’t have another child.

14 year old is posting about doing sexual things on social media.,"(TL;DR--- SIL lied about inappropriate relationships and social media posts, had a heartless reaction to a tearful plea, so how do I move forward (if possible))

Background: My (23F) sister-in-law (14F) lives in another state but my husband is considered her legal guardian (her mother has some legal residency issues). I've known her since she was 9, and I see her as a full sister. Her mother is a single mom and is working a lot and out of town a lot. 

I have always tried to be supportive of my SIL, and I've tried to maintain a judgement-free zone with her. At the same time, because her mom isn't able to be around much, I've done a lot of parenting with her. SIL has told me things that she hasn't even told her mother or brother (my husband).

I have always kept our conversations private, and I have been very straightforward about sex and if she needs contraception EVENTUALLY. I told her that I think she should wait til she's at least 18, but if she decides to do it earlier that I would help her so she doesn't get an STD or pregnant. 

I've talked to her a lot, always trying to listen and be an open ear/open mind. She started talking to this boy and would constantly FaceTime him when she would visit us. I had my suspicions that they were a thing, but she said he was just a friend. I left it at that.

Fast forward to this evening--I finally started a TikTok account and found her profile from my contacts. She has a bunch of inappropriate videos (none visually sexualizing herself) but some where she TALKS about getting ""freaky"" on camera with the guy she's been talking to (she has screenshots of his Snapchat reactions to her teasing him that way...etc.). She has other videos where she basically says ""what am I good at??"" And some of the Snapchat responses she screenshot were ""s*cking d***"" and ""being a dirty wh**e.""

I was shaken and horrified. I called her, CRYING, expressing to her how I felt like I had failed her, that I was sad she didn't trust me enough to come to me about these things and that she lied to my face.

She just said ""Ok"" in a kind of careless, rolled-her-eyes-through-the-phone way. I was absolutely devastated.

While I know she might not actually be doing these things, it's strongly implied with these videos. 

I'm frustrated:

1) at her mom for not being more on top of her and being there for her emotionally 

2) at my SIL for doing all these things and responding to me so heartlessly

So what's the advice here? My husband and her mom are going to have a heart to heart with her about her emotional needs like ""we haven't been here for you, how can we be better emotionally available to you??"" because to me something deeper is obviously going on. I'm so hurt, but I'm not sure what kind of say I can have in it since I'm not blood.",0,"year old is posting about doing sexual things on social media.

Frustrated With Son's Work Ethic,"I (single mother, 36), don't know what to do with my son. (14)  


For background, for all of elementary and middle school, he was an A/B student, with one C in math in the 8th grade. This year however, freshman year of high school, his grades have plummeted. In the first quarter of the year, I was unaware of his grades. He said he lost his report card and didn't actually look at it before leaving school because they got rushed out (my house is out in the county and my children go to school in the city, so I drop them off at my mother's house in the morning and pick them up when I get off work in the evening, most days). I didn't think much of it at the time, as he tends to lose things quite often, and had told stories before of his school's, at times, somewhat dysfunctional management.   


Fast forward to the second quarter. Report cards go out again, and this time he brings his to me, and there are multiple Fs and Ds across both quarters. A long winded conversation ensued and he spouted some nonsense about ""not having developed autonomy,"" and ""not consciously realizing"" that he actually had to do his homework due to ""precedent."" His words. He's very intelligent but can be so infuriatingly stupid sometimes.  


I decided to let it go for the time after he made promises to improve himself.  


Again, fast forward to now. A few days ago I received a call from his biology teacher while on my way to work, and she informed me that my son had completed *none* of his biology work. When I called him and asked him why this was, he said he'd been working through the other classes and biology was last in line. Okay. I hung up and continued my drive. Yesterday and the day before, he was working all day on his biology work. I asked him just last night if he'd completed all of his other classes, and if what he was doing for biology as all he had left. He said yes. The high school children in their district were to enroll in all of their classes on some site, and just have at least 80% of each class's coursework done by today. I was contacted by the school today and informed that, apart from biology, he had done *no work whatsoever.* I was *furious.* Not only did he not do any of his work prior to the biology teacher calling me, he had the audacity to *lie* about it!  


He was in his room reading. From the look on his face when i entered the room, I'd say he already knew this was coming. I flew into a rage, asking him repeatedly for what reason he had decided not to do any of his schoolwork. All I got was mumbled ""I don't know""s. He's been on his phone and the Xbox for a considerable amount of time since the shutdown, so of course I took those, but there were also stretches of time where he'd be doing something else, like reading, so there's got to be some other reason and solution I'm not seeing here.

Completely lost,"I have a 15 year old that lies to me, steals from me, and manipulates me. I have to hide my money and bank cards because he has stolen close to $1000 from me. His room is beyond disgusting, it's not just dirty clothes, its dirty dishes, rotting food, he doesn't keep up with the cat he insists he has as a support animal, so the cat pisses on all the clothes on the floor. Most of which, are clean clothes that I just spent $100 to wash everyone's clothes when the washer was broken. I will tell him he needs to clean the room, he will just play games instead of cleaning. So I will change the wifi so he has to clean his room first. It always turns into him crying saying he is suicidal, which only would come up when I was trying to discipline him. He has gone to a mental facility twice, and is in day therapy. He is a cutter as well. His room is a health risk, but if I push him to clean it, he cuts or says he is suicidal. In one of his journal logs at therapy he had even written that he wanted to kill me.

I also have an 18 year old, in high school, that refuses to get a job, and doesn't help with the house work unless I say something. We did have a work contract set up where he would clean the bathroom and take out garbage daily. He wouldn't do it, so I changed the wifi password. His response was he was going to turn himself in for smoking pot. I know now that I should've just called his bluff, but being the caring person I am, on top of the mental and emotional issues that he has, I didn't want that to happen.

I had an abusive marrage, so I was always the overly caring, soft parent. I have tried to be the strong parent, however they just walk all over me and manipulate me now.  If I try to discipline it always ""I'm suicidal"", or ""im willing to throw my life away because im not getting what I want"". 

Now I have a boyfriend that lives with me, he is supportive of me, helps me with the house and bills. He has been there for me more than any other guy I have dated. The boys and him don't get along. He doesn't hit them, he makes sure they have necessities. Yes he has raised his voice at them. He is angry about the way they treat me, and he can't do anything to help, because ""your not my dad,"" and he is the boyfriend, not parent. No, he doesn't interact with them that much, he has also seen the disrespect since the start. The boys want him out of the house because he gets angry with them, and he gets angry because of thier behavior and disrespect.

Edit: the ex husband hasn't been in our lives for 6 years now. The 15 yr old didn't start bringing up thoughts of suicide until he was middle school, after the ex was no longer in our life, and since than would only say anything about it when he was in trouble. He has also dealt with bullying at every school he has been to. His response to bullying is to try and make others think he is a violent bad ass, he is not a violent person. He pushed a bully once, but that is the extent of his violence towards others.  

Him and I have been working closely with his councilors, the social worker at school that has helped us since we moved here, and the crisis line. I'm doing my best to be as supportive as I can. I do believe that he is hurting from everything, it just makes things difficult when the suicide talk only happens when he is in trouble. I've been honest with the boys about how I was as a teen, and things I had done, and what the outcomes where. He went to the facility twice in a month, when he went the second time he added things to what is wrong, he added things that I had done/felt when I was younger to what he is saying he has done/felt. Him saying he wanted to hurt others didn't come up until after I told him how I was. As a teen I was a bitch, I didn't care about anyone, including myself, I was a cutter, I set things on fire, I dropped out of school, and a multitude of other things. I had things happen that made me do a 180, I went from being a bitch to being an over caring doormat that has pretty much put others feelings above my own.

Edit: I sit down with the boys when they are in trouble and talk about what happened, why they felt the need to do it, and what consequences are going to happen because of the behavior. If they are honest there is still a consequence, but if I find out they lied the consequence is a bit more. 

I know I have been too easy with the consequences, after what we have been through I have been as understanding about thier actions as I can.  I'm more of a mediator, conflict and arguing bothers me greatly, I have always felt talking about what's wrong is more productive than just arguing or yelling. Yes, there have been times I have been overwhelmed and raised my voice. Unfortunately, just talking about it, and being too light has contributed to part of the problem because it is hard for me to be stern.",0,"Completely lost I have a year old that lies to me, steals from me, and manipulates me.

No, he doesn't interact with them that much, he has also seen the disrespect since the start. The boys want him out of the house because he gets angry with them, and he gets angry because of thier behavior and disrespect.  Edit: the ex husband hasn't been in our lives for years now. The yr old didn't start bringing up thoughts of suicide until he was middle school, after the ex was no longer in our life, and since than would only say anything about it when he was in trouble. He has also dealt with bullying at every school he has been to. His response to bullying is to try and make others think he is a violent bad ass, he is not a violent person. He pushed a bully once, but that is the extent of his violence towards others.    Him and I have been working closely with his councilors, the social worker at school that has helped us since we moved here, and the crisis line. I'm doing my best to be as supportive as I can. I do believe that he is hurting from everything, it just makes things difficult when the suicide talk only happens when he is in trouble. I've been honest with the boys about how I was as a teen, and things I had done, and what the outcomes where. He went to the facility twice in a month, when he went the second time he added things to what is wrong, he added things that I had done/felt when I was younger to what he is saying he has done/felt. Him saying he wanted to hurt others didn't come up until after I told him how I was. As a teen I was a bitch, I didn't care about anyone, including myself, I was a cutter, I set things on fire, I dropped out of school, and a multitude of other things. I had things happen that made me do a 180, I went from being a bitch to being an over caring doormat that has pretty much put others feelings above my own.  Edit: I sit down with the boys when they are in trouble and talk about what happened, why they felt the need to do it, and what consequences are going to happen because of the behavior. If they are honest there is still a consequence, but if I find out they lied the consequence is a bit more.   I know I have been too easy with the consequences, after what we have been through I have been as understanding about thier actions as I can.  I'm more of a mediator, conflict and arguing bothers me greatly, I have always felt talking about what's wrong is more productive than just arguing or yelling. Yes, there have been times I have been overwhelmed and raised my voice. Unfortunately, just talking about it, and being too light has contributed to part of the problem because it is hard for me to be stern.",15,2,4858,960,Teenager 13-19 Years
"How do you deal with a teenage daughter who always does the opposite of what you ask, advice or recommend?","For example I realized that any time she asks me something about how and what to do, regardless of what I say, if it is left or right, she always does the opposite.
I got to a point to sometimes not even suggest anything because this way there is greater chance she will do the right thing.
What is your experience and what should be the right approach if any?

Soon to be stepdaughter is almost too much to deal with.,"First post so hello everyone! I'm pretty new to parenting and the only experience I have with kids are young (ex preschool teacher/ early childhood development psychologist). The kid we are both dealing with is 15, and flunking out of school badly. We both offer to help but she lies about homework, we came to the decision to stay in touch with all of her teachers next semester to find out what she actually needs to do so have that somewhat settled. She is extremely spoiled to the point that I'm worried she is going to have a very rough time when she gets older because she can't and won't do anything for herself. She does absolutely nothing around the house and her room is so filthy it's grotesque, so she often takes over the living room even though she has more than she will ever need to entertain herself in her room, and gets it filthy and refuses to clean after herself. Also she is unhealthily overweight and refuses to do anything about it, so I'm worried about her physical and mental health. She says she has depression and refuses to go to therapy, and won't listen to what either has to say about the matter. She also lies to her friends about her home situation because I think she enjoys the attention of being pitied. For some reason she tells them she is somehow abused/ neglected wich is very false, she will tell them she hasn't ate for days   or there is no food in the house, but she refuses to invite them over. My fiance has even been willing to go on vacation &amp; travel in order for her to in my opinion stupidly visit friends she's only met online and I think that could be dangerous for both of them. With all that being said I still care about her daughter regardless of all the stupid stuff she does. And sorry for the blog post, needed to vent. I will be forever grateful for any input/ help on the matter. Just putting this out there for opinions &amp; suggestions for you guys who are soo much more qualified &amp; experienced than me.",0,"Soon to be stepdaughter is almost too much to deal with.

Would you pay your child for babysitting even if they don't have to actually do anything?,"My kids are 14 (15 in August), 13, and 8 (9 at the end of June). 

My husband and I like to go to dinner every Friday night for date night. That has been stopped lately but our city is slowly opening back up and we would like to get back to it. We used to leave the oldest in charge when we went out but he didn't have to actually do much of anything. He would usually just play video games the whole time. My 13 year old is the better babysitter. Granted my nearly 9 year old doesn't need constant supervision but he'll play with her and keep her company. One time he wanted to go to a friend's house but his sister wanted him to stay home and babysit. He decided to stay home, babysit, and then go to his friends after we got home so he could make some money. I thought it was a mature decision. We didn't want to make him stay just because his sister wanted him to babysit but he decided that the money was worth it and stayed a little longer. 

We pay both boys but pay the younger one more because he does more work. He's the one playing outside with her, helping her make a snack, playing board games, putting on a movie, etc. The oldest just goes to the computer, puts his headphones on, and tells his siblings to let him know if the house is on fire or if someone needs an ambulance. Other than that he doesn't do anything but he thinks he deserves as much money as his brother. I don't want to treat them unfairly but I feel like I am paying them for their effort they put in. I don't want this to come across the wrong way but my older one almost never leaves the house so it's not like he's giving up a night with friends to keep an eye on his sister and we don't even make him do it. If he wanted to be completely free of responsibilities and wanted his sister with another babysitter then we would do that but he wouldn't be getting paid. He wants the money but puts in minimal effort. The 13 year old likes to hang out with friends so he does sometimes wait to hang out with friends until he's done babysitting if he wants the money. 

We are usually at dinner for about 2 hours. We pay the oldest 10 dollars and the middle one 20 dollars for babysitting.

Concerned about teenage drinking,"We recently gave our 17-year old daughter a new cell phone for for her birthday, and she had some trouble transferring the data from her old phone to the new one.  While she was at work, I decided to see if I could help her, and while fiddling with her phone, did some snooping and read a number of texts, many of which referenced drinking and smoking pot.  

She is a good student and pretty responsible, but her father has addiction issues and I am concerned about her use of illegal substances long term.  Furthermore, because of the coronavirus, in-person instruction ended at her school in March, and summer is looming ahead without a lot of structure, which seems like fertile ground for bad teenage behavior.  

How can I talk with her about this in a way that fosters communication and trust without lecturing?   I don’t expect her to not experiment, but want her to be aware of the many negative consequences of underage drinking and marijuana use.

How do I tell the parents of my daughter’s bf that he gave her herpes?,"Yesterday I took my 17 year old to the emergency room because of severe pain and discomfort in her private area.

I'm really not sure what to do.,"When my daughter was born I was a idiot. I could try to make excuses but I'm not going to. For 12 years I paid child support but was never there. 3 years ago I found her mom after loosing her number. I've been building a relationship since then.  I live in Wisconsin. My daughter lives with the step dad in Washington because her moms a mess. 

With our relationship becoming better we have been talking a lot. We were having the occasional 2 hour conversation. About a month ago I noticed weird stuff. First was when he forced her to stay still so he could shave her head. He did it to her sister too. That seemed like a asshole thing to do but I didn't think much about it. 

Little things cought my attention but I dont remember them.  Tiny little remarks basically. When all the riots started my daughter went out into woods on the step dads property with some friends. They were doing teenage girl talk stuff and the step dad decided to go spy on them and listen to them.  That's odd but that's not what concerned me. He brought a loaded gun with him and fired a few rounds to scare them.  As a gun owner myself this cought my attention and scared me. You don't use guns as a joke.  

Fast forward to last week. Wednesday night I only get 15 minutes with my daughter because of ""phone issues"" on the dads phone. She tells me she was hit a few times and her head bounced off the wall every time. If she didn't answer his questions ""he had another side of the face to use"" that's what was apparently said.

Thursday I didn't do anything. Friday morning I called cps. I was concerned and had questions. I'm on the other side of the US but this is starting to really bother me. It sounds horrible for her.

Friday night we have a good talk. She really opens up and we talk about her step dad. Physical abuse is not normal but he will back her into a corner when yelling at her. The more ""normal"" abuse is mental. She's not his daughter so she's told constantly that she is not as good as them. He won't allow her to learn to drive or do college type classes. She's possibly open to moving here. She would miss her siblings but she hates it there.

Monday cps showed up at his home. I guess I should of expected that but I didn't at all. Now I can't get a hold of her and according to the step dad she told the cps people that she has no interest in moving here. 

At this point I'm feeling lost. Not really sure what to do. Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Edit: apparently a kid saying they are getting beat and abused holds no legal ground in Washington. Cool. Not really something I wanted to hear but I called a lawyer for help since I'm clueless about this stuff.",0,"I'm really not sure what to do. When my daughter was born I was a idiot.

I don't mind him coming to me. I just feel bad that I can't always give him the answers he is looking for and can't speak from first hand experience. He's not a shy kid so I'm not sure why he's less comfortable talking to men about this. My year old is very shy when it comes to talking about these things so I suspect he'll either come to us or his brother when he starts getting curious so I want to make sure I am handling this the right way.,81,16,1720,352,Teenager 13-19 Years
Combatitive daughter ruins family time,"I don’t know where to start.  She will be fifteen this fall.

Her dad washed his hands of her a long time ago.  He was not a good person, AT ALL.  He abused our son.  However, he made some accurate observations about our daughter that I ignored until recently.  

He kind of just disappeared after the divorce and started a new family within a month with a new wife and two step kids.  At first he took about half of his visitation but lost it in part because of how they treated my daughter.  

Every time she was with them she was very combative, understandably.  Their stepmother acted like she cared but would send messages through my ex husband that she didn’t want to deal with the harder aspects of parenting when it came to our children (for instance, my daughter got lice EVERY TIME she went over there but they didn’t want to have to comb it out.  They refused to buy her a toothbrush during one visit because “that’s what child support is for.”  Her stepmother wouldn’t wash her clothes so my daughter got an infection from dirty undies. 

First was the anger.  Constant anger.  I chalked it up to trauma and the divorce.  She would say incredibly nasty, hurtful, personal things to everyone, like telling her brother who had attempted suicide that she wished he’d been successful.

Then came the acting out.  She said she would do ANYTHING for attention and she certainly did.  Acting out sexually, behaviorally, etc.  In a school of 2,000 children she became “the” problem child.

Their step dad arrived on the scene about four years ago.  He saw what was going on from the very beginning and wasn’t deterred.  He has loved them fiercely since day one.  There was a learning curve as he had never been a parent, and he and our daughter have very similar personalities and clash a lot.  He would previously lose his temper when she would get really nasty but has done a ton of work in therapy to fix that.  

We are a sex positive family that holds strong beliefs about self improvement and believe in taking care of your mental health.  We take things very seriously when one of our kids has a problem.  

We were not happy when she began acting out sexually without proper protection.  We took her to the pediatrician to have the doctor back us up.  She scoffed anyhow.  

She started running away from school claiming to be in a fugue state or having panic attacks but it came out later these were maybe faked.

She has either refused to continue with every therapist she has seen or they ‘fire’ her.  Her last one said he thinks the only solution is a wilderness program.

She got on some anti depressants which  helped a bit for a while.  Her psychiatrist watched very calmly as my daughter threw a temper tantrum in her office, slamming her head against the wall, pulling her hair and screaming profanities.  She told her the meds would help, if she would give them a chance.  

Even with the meds though, she is mad at everyone all the time.  It is someone new every day.  Some new issue every day.  But she is never at peace with everyone in the house.  

Every time I ask her to do something she explodes and argues with me and starts a fight.  She is constantly screaming at her brother. 

If any of us makes a mistake, no matter how small, it is held against us and as she says “she doesn’t accept apologies.”  She said that she doesn’t want to live with people who keep making mistakes, sometimes the same mistakes.  I told her that people usually struggle along the same lines consistently and that she would be unlikely to find people in life who would never repeat a mistake or made a new one daily.  (To give an example, her brother talks too much, or I am too sensitive, etc as an example of mistakes that won’t change.  Nobody is yelling at her or beating her or anything.)  One family member has been really stressed recently and is being a little short with everyone.  He apologizes when he realizes it.  But she says we should all just STOP making mistakes.

Her dad and I are in counseling and read parenting and self help books and are working through shortcomings we have.  We aren’t ones to stay stagnant in a bad place.  We aren’t perfect parents but we are pretty good ones.

Her anger and attitude has made it almost impossible for us to spend quality time with her, even individually.  She and her stepdad have things they do together, then she and her brother, she and I.  We try to make it so that everyone in the house gets one on one time with everyone else so bonds will be strong.  We also make sure the kids get plenty of time with friends and alone, as well as family time.  

She talks to us about anything, bursts into our room in the middle of the night to talk to us, seems to enjoy the hobbies we do together, but most of the time is just so cruel.  

Last night her dad and I were planning an at home date night and had spent an hour trying to order our food and wrangling our other kids.  As soon as we were about to leave to pick it up, she says that our oldest son has a HUGE issue with us and that she feels neglected and that nobody is communicating or spending enough time together and could we cancel our date night and hang out?  The night before we had played a board game.  We canceled our food order and called our son down who said he didn’t have a problem with us at all.  (He is open when he does so we didn’t press it.)  He had to end a live match with friends on Xbox  to come down and was frustrated with her but we all talked and decided on a dinner plan to share together and then decided to watch a show together.  Once all the plans were in motion, she decided she had changed her mind, but it was too late to change anything.  She sat down here pouting for 45 minutes then went upstairs.  Between her outburst, changing all the dinner plans, the talk, getting the little ones settled, etc it was almost midnight and so her dad and I needed to go to bed and we didn’t get to have our time together.

Family time is always so awful. I hate to say it but we dread spending time with her now.  She ruins every activity.  Board games, movies, everything.  We were struggling to find something to do together that wouldn’t cause a fight.  If we offer two board game suggestions, for instance, she will wait for someone to else to speak up first then say “Ew no, I want the other one.”  It is that way about EVERYTHING.  That’s one of the reasons it took so long to order the family dinner last night.

So her dad and I were discussing options for family time that could avoid fights, avoid more screen time, etc.  I remembered that everyone had loved the Harry Potter movie marathon we had done and we agreed that it would be fun if we would start reading the books out loud as a family.  

We called the kids down for it tonight but didn’t tell them why.  I was so so excited.  She saw the book in my hand and flew off the handle, saying that “I better not think I was going to make her listen to me read a book.”  I calmly told her that I was.  Everyone got settled and I started to read and she hopped up and just marched out of the house.  When she came back in, I told her that was unacceptable.  She started to get angry and say that this wasn’t right or fair and that she shouldn’t be forced to be with the family or do something that she didn’t want to do.  Her brother put a blanket over his head which has become his go-to when she starts to rant.  

I asked her why she is so angry and what her issue with reading was.  I asked her why she is so unkind to everyone.  I told her that she is doing serious damage to relationships she would have forever and that I was concerned that between this and the way she treats friends and romantic partners that she would end up alone and sad and that I didn’t want that for her.  I said  that we are not perfect but that we are the only parents she’s got.  

She said “Actually I have two more.” And gives me the nastiest look.  This other woman has spent one week total, MAYBE with my daughter in her whole life, and that would be a stretch.  She wouldn’t stop her car if she saw my daughter dying on the side of the road.

I told my daughter to stop acting like a b*****.  (I know, I know.)  I was so incredibly hurt and mad.  Our oldest son is about to turn 18 and the fact that family time is always ruined with so little time left with some of my kids is weighing on me.  

Now I feel completely lost and like a terrible mother.  I feel as though the whole family is being held hostage constantly by a tiny terrorist.  I don’t know what to do.",0,"Combatitive daughter ruins family time I don’t know where to start.  She will be fifteen this fall.  Her dad washed his hands of her a long time ago.

Complete Opposite Parenting Styles,"Hey guys, quick back story. I've been raising my 15 year old cousin since she's been 11. I'm 33 and my boyfriend moved in with us about 8 months ago. He and my cousin get along great, they always have because before being my boyfriend, he was my best friend of 10 years.

She has no respect for me and continues to fight me on the few things I ask of her. My boyfriend has taken the role of parent as well and is helping to raise her but he is extremely laid back and I've only ever heard him yell twice in the 13 years I've known him. He is someone who talks through everything and I don't believe that he is disciplining her. I am the only one who deals with it and he always believes there's a lesson to be taught rather than punishing her. Yesterday she was screaming in my face and being extremely rude and he just sat there. Today I was on the phone with her mother and we were teasing her because she was flipping out about having to eat hard tacos instead of soft. He told me I was antagonizing her.

Is it ever okay to talk to teen girl about eating habits?,"This is my first post and I’m hoping for some good and kind advice. My daughter (16) has become a constant eater and seems to always be eating, cooking, baking, or talking about eating something. It’s her number one choice for filling her time. Thus, she is gaining weight rapidly. I have said *nothing* to her to this point, but it is distressing my husband and I to see this happening. We have a close relationship, but I hesitate to address the habit I’m seeing for fear of her feeling judged or triggering unhealthy behaviors. 
She does seem to read labels and tries to get daily exercise, but I know she is overestimating the balance between calories in/calories out. I really do not want to say anything to her as I know that likely will backfire. I want her to be healthy. I want her to not use food as her outlet for boredom or as a reward for being “good,” both of which I’ve noticed. Is there any way that a parent can speak with a teenage girl about weight issues without completely screwing up? Thanks in advance for your kindness and I would value hearing from anyone who’s had a similar experience.",0,"Is it ever okay to talk to teen girl about eating habits?

Should I let my 17 year old stepson do online school?,"Hello so I have a 17 year old that is extremely motivated and driven. Recently he has been bringing up wanting to do online highschool classes to graduate early and go to community college and increase his hours at work. 

As of now he seems to be off to a good start he has a little over $3,000 saved up and can pay for community college and whatever else he needs.

I'm not sure if I'm okay with this for his age he seems to be moving quickly. I just want him to enjoy being a kid and not having to worry about much. He is so responsible and independent I love it but it does worry me at the same time.

His plan would be to graduate about a year early go to a CC and get an associates degree in automotive technology. And to them go into something called the "" BMW step program "" 

Should I let him do this he seems passionate about doing this and I would like advice thank you :)",0,"Should I let my year old stepson do online school?

Should I talk to this girl’s mother?,"We recently moved to a completely new state, and live adjacent to a beach town. My older daughter, 14, is a total extrovert, and made friends immediately. She and her friend (who is a very nice girl, no trouble, good grades, etc) asked to be dropped off at the beach. I said no, but that I would bring them to the beach and sit a distance away to give them their privacy. We weren’t there but 20 minutes and a young man, about their age, stopped at their blanket and started talking to them. I assumed it was someone from school, and kept an eye out. I watched him follow them to the water and back, at which time I texted my daughter and asked if everything was ok. She said the guy was annoying but fine. Time went on and he didn’t leave. My daughter finally texted me “Mom, could you get this guy to leave us alone? He’s really creeping us out.” I went over there and almost immediately my daughter’s friend said, “Can we (meaning she, my daughter, and the creeper kid) leave the beach and go get snow cones??” I said no, and basically told the kid to get lost, which he did. I spoke to the girls right then, and also more in depth in the car on the way home later. Both girls, my daughter and the friend, confirmed that they felt uncomfortable, and didn’t want this kid around. I asked the friend why on earth she was offering to leave the beach with someone she felt uncomfortable with?!?! She couldn’t give me an answer, and finally just said she didn’t know how to say no without hurting his feelings, and didn’t want a confrontation. 

This happened a couple days ago and I just can’t shake the sick feeling that this little girl was going to leave with a person she didn’t feel comfortable with just to avoid hurting his feelings, or to avoid a scene. It shook me. I don’t know the mom well, just to say hi and have a quick chat. Is this something I should tell her about?? If so, what should I say? I don’t want to get her in trouble or disrupt my daughter’s new friendship.

(newly) 16 year old step son dating a 25 year old woman,"Hey. So, my (40f) partner's (40m) son who JUST turned 16 is seeing a woman who is 25. I'm not sure what to think of this, but I'm pretty uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to feel or what to do (if anything). The kid (James) is mature I suppose, as mature as a freshly-turned 16 year old can be. and I don't know the woman (Kecia) but I did see her at his 16th birthday party (that she came was weird in itself, and she did not talk to any of the parents).  James's mom knows her a bit and described her as 'grounded'. We heard that this relationship was forming recently and my partner was pretty shocked and so was I. I feel it's inappropriate. James's mom seems to be fine with it, she did use the term 'good' like maybe it's good for him. I think 'good' is a stretch. My partner has said the same thing too but he is uncomfortable with it generally, even though it will probably run it's course soon and everything will be fine. And I know we can't stop them from seeing each other. So what to do? 

I don't know if my past experience is influencing my feelings. I know there's a huge difference between boys and girls, that girls are more at risk of abuse, but I know it can go both ways, and there is a pretty big power dynamic between a teenager and an adult no matter what the gender. I have had a lot of bad relationship experiences when I was younger, I dated a 28 y/o when I was 18 and it was definitely not good. I also, full disclosure, was smooching with an 18 y/o briefly when I was 28, but felt sleeping with him would be wrong, and definitely wouldn't go hang around his parents!!!  

 I'm feeling pretty protective of the kid. I'm struggling with wanting to contact Kecia and ask her what she's doing, and what her intentions are having a relationship with someone who's barely legal, but I don't know if that's out of line. They are fully having sleepovers, we just found out last night.  I'm concerned about the kiddo. I don't know if James's mom has spoken to the kid or Kecia (I texted her but haven't heard back, and we are on good terms). My partner is a zombie from doing university online so he doesn't really have the space to deal with it.  James will be here on Monday and I am definitely going to sit down with him for a serious talk about relationships - he is a total clam when it comes to talking about relationships, he's had numerous 'girlfriends' so far (nothing like this though) and apparently has been having sex since he was 13 - but I don't care if he sits there staring at the floor the whole time, if he's going to be in an adult relationship he's going to have to start acting like one and communicating and being a healthy human. It feels like he's gone from 15 to 20 all of a sudden! But he is still a child and still needs parenting. 

I'd love to hear others' thoughts on the matter! Step-parenting is so weird.",0,"(newly) year old step son dating a year old woman Hey. So, my (40f) partner's (40m) son who JUST turned is seeing a woman who is 25. I'm not sure what to think of this, but I'm pretty uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to feel or what to do (if anything). The kid (James) is mature I suppose, as mature as a freshly-turned year old can be. and I don't know the woman (Kecia) but I did see her at his 16th birthday party (that she came was weird in itself, and she did not talk to any of the parents).  James's mom knows her a bit and described her as 'grounded'. We heard that this relationship was forming recently and my partner was pretty shocked and so was I. I feel it's inappropriate. James's mom seems to be fine with it, she did use the term 'good' like maybe it's good for him. I think 'good' is a stretch. My partner has said the same thing too but he is uncomfortable with it generally, even though it will probably run it's course soon and everything will be fine. And I know we can't stop them from seeing each other. So what to do?   I don't know if my past experience is influencing my feelings. I know there's a huge difference between boys and girls, that girls are more at risk of abuse, but I know it can go both ways, and there is a pretty big power dynamic between a teenager and an adult no matter what the gender. I have had a lot of bad relationship experiences when I was younger, I dated a y/o when I was and it was definitely not good. I also, full disclosure, was smooching with an y/o briefly when I was 28, but felt sleeping with him would be wrong, and definitely wouldn't go hang around his parents!!!     I'm feeling pretty protective of the kid. I'm struggling with wanting to contact Kecia and ask her what she's doing, and what her intentions are having a relationship with someone who's barely legal, but I don't know if that's out of line. They are fully having sleepovers, we just found out last night.  I'm concerned about the kiddo. I don't know if James's mom has spoken to the kid or Kecia (I texted her but haven't heard back, and we are on good terms).

My child wants to date,"My mother passed away in February this year and I (20f) am now raising my sister, and I am pregnant with my first. 
 
She is 14 years old and is demanding that she should be allowed to date at 15. My mother was always very strict with me when it came to dating, she allowed me to date at age 16 but as long as my grades didn’t get affected. My sister has learning disabilities herself and already struggles with school, I feel like adding a boyfriend would be too stressful especially that young. 

My sister told me if I didn’t let her date at 15 she’d probably do it behind my back which hurts. She is very stubborn and doesn’t like to hear what I have to say about it. Lately she’s been very disrespectful to others and has even made rude comments to me. We are very close but now I am struggling with trying to put my foot down with her. It’s very stressful and it’s hard not to get emotionally.

Reconnecting With Estranged Daughter(16) Need Advice,"I just recently reconnected with my daughter (16) and even though she didn't ask I know she probably plans on asking me to move in. I know this because her Dad is an abusive narcissist (he took her and her brother from me when they were very young) and I feel that is what our conversation was building up to.

To give you a better understanding of the situation I'll be blunt I was a foreigner new to America, I met my ex we were young struggling artists/entertainers and he, back then was young charming and charismatic. I was so freaking naive as time passed he became bitter over his own failures started blaming me and slowly his abuse started getting worse until he dropped me like a bad habit.

He left me pregnant, in debt (his debt actually) and facing deportation.

I was more devastated than I ever thought was possible and I swore I'd never let myself be that powerless again so I used the skills I had and it took a few years but I made a sizable business in the sex industry.

17 year old daughter obsessed with BF,"Hi guys I’m new to this group and need help. I have 3 kids and I have a restaurant wich requires me to work all day along with my husband. I have a 14 year old boy,a 15 year old girl, and a 17 year old girl. They are all great but my 17 year old daughter is giving me a lot of trouble. She graduated high school early and enrolled in college and went to college for about 3 months. Out of the blue she informed me that her boyfriend of 6 months was dropping out of high school and moving to LA to persue a career as a rapper. A week after he moved to LA my daughter started telling me she was depressed and didn’t want to go to college anymore because it was making her more depressed. I asked why she was depressed and she said she didn’t know but I knew exactly why she was claiming to be depressed. It was because her boyfriend had moved to LA. Sure enough she convinced me that if I didn’t let her drop out of college her depression would make her harm herself so I gave in and let her drop out of college with the promise that she would return next semester. I don’t like her boyfriend he dumps her all the time and tells her he doesn’t want to be with her but she just won’t leave him alone. She is always sneaking behind my back and riding the train to LA we live in San Diego so it’s not too far. But when she leaves she stays for weeks and comes back like she did nothing wrong. When she is home she fights with my other kids and is always crying and on the phone crying to her boyfriend begging him not to leave her. Recently due to Covid-19 her boyfriends mom lost her job so now he comes to my house while I’m gone and takes my daughter and my car and they work Uber Eats together and split the money so he can help his mom financially. The problem is that it’s my car and my Uber account that they are working. Wich is going to affect me when I do my taxes this year. Her boyfriends comes and spends all week here using my car and my daughter to make money for his family and leaves for the weekend to visit his family and take the money he made.

How to cope with kids leaving?," So my first daughter was born when I was 20 years old. I did the right thing, asked my then girlfriend (she was also 20 at the time) to marry me, and thus here I am with an 18-year-old. Now my daughter, Lauren, has always loved her daddy. And when I was growing up, since my father never gave me attention, I acted out in school, and always got in trouble. But when Lauren was born, she just jumped on my stomach over and over and I loved every minute of it. And as a 18-year-old, she's never had a boyfriend. Not to say she's ugly, she's actually a pretty girl, but I'm 90% sure she's asexual. She was always focused on academics and her favorite hobby is reading.

When Lauren was 3, our second daughter Lily was born. And one thing both girls always had in common is, how awesome Dad is. Hell, Lily used to text me every day for the last two years, from randomly shooting me middle finger emojis, just to say how her day was going. Lily and I would go to comic book conventions together, anime conventions, those types of things. It was like as if you separated my personality, both daughters had something. Lauren (x-files fan) - Lily (Naruto fan). Side note, for the past 6 years, I've been working out of state. I'm only home Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday.

Now both girls are my rocks. The reasons I get up in the morning, go to work, and bring home cash. Here's my problem: As stupid as it sounds, I feel like I'm losing both of my daughters. Lauren is going off to college, to a different state across the continent, and Lily has found herself a boyfriend. Those text now are non-existent. And since I'm only home on the weekends, I feel like all of Lily's attention is going to Mom. I understand Lily is at that age where she can't talk to dad about this boy, or sex talk (trust me, I do not want that) or other mom-type issues. But it still sucks. One example of something that sucked is, Lily just turned 15 this past May. And she was excited about doing the driving lessons I promised. So, I took her driving so she could her learners permit and we had a blast. This past weekend, I home and Lily was like, ""Yep. Mom's been taking me driving. You don't have to worry about it anymore."" When I asked the wife about that, Wife said, ""You got her excited about driving and she begged me to take her. What was I supposed to do?""

And another thing was, I had the first awkward silence I've ever felt with her. While out shopping, she stretched and I noticed she is almost at ab level. I said, ""Wow, have you been working out?"" She froze, giving me the deer in headlights look. I found this strange because I begged her to come with me to the gym last summer and she mostly refused. Then she said, ""I don't feel comfortable telling you that."" I'm like, what?! Man, she could have said I'm doing sit-ups and I would have shrugged it off. But, man that was rough for me. I don't know, I'm really struggling with this. It's actually kept me up at night because I know this was bound to happen, but I was just not prepared for it. I'm not going to hold them back, it just sucks losing them. I feel so pathetic. Sorry for the whining, I just had to get this out.",0,"How to cope with kids leaving?

My older son literally despises his sister,"I don't know how this happened or how I let it happen. My mom was big on always having more than one kid because it's not fair for a child to grow up lonely, so that's why I thought two was the magical number. I had a son first, and when he was three his sister was born. As a child he was mainly just neutral towards her, he didn't bother much with her and left her on her own. I would always try to get him to play with her but whenever she cried he'd walk away and he just didn't seem to care for her. Now they're 13F and 16M. 

When they grew up it became pretty clear that she literally adored him. She'd ask his opinion on everything and copy all of his interests (he was a baseball player so she asked to join up too, he likes video games so she asked for a PlayStation, the books and movies he likes so does she) and pretty much idolized him.

He, on the other hand, seemed to care for her less and less. He loved playing baseball outside with his father in the yard and she insisted to join in and his dad was happy to let her, but as soon as she started playing he walked away. We figured it'd be fair for him to get his own time with his dad so his dad talked to her and said how about they play baseball themselves in an hour, he just wants to spend time with her brother first. She wasn't happy about it and refused, but finally ended up relenting and it went back to him and his dad playing. 

We're just not sure what to do at this point. He's her hero, but he doesn't seem to give a shit about her. She's always asking him what he thinks of this, and if he wants to throw around a ball with her, but he literally always says no. About five or six months ago, he started a new thing where he just started ignoring her. Like he wouldn't talk to her at all unless she spoke to him and even then he'd pretend not to hear her until she'd come up in front of him and make it clear she was talking to him.

I don't get it, and I don't get what to do. Our 13-year-old is heartbroken and keeps on asking us why he won't spend time with her and we have no idea what caused this, and why there's this one-sided hatred.

I need advice!!,"I have a 17 year old son who is half Hispanic.  I am white.  We moved to North Carolina last year from Texas.  Four months ago, he started working at his first job at a fast food place.  He plans on going to college after he graduates high school, so he is not trying to build a future or anything but we were all hoping it would be a good experience for him.

Tonight he came home wide-eyed and he said he wanted to talk to me about something.  He has a manager at work that he has told me before that he feels like the guy does not like him.  He did not know why so I told him to just keep working hard and not worry about it.  He said that tonight when he was leaving, the manager called to him, “You no work tomorrow?” and was acting like my son did not speak English.  (Sadly, my son does not speak a lick of Spanish other than what he has learned in high school Spanish classes).  The manager was mocking him and making fun of him and two other young people that work there were laughing at him, too.

He said he was caught off guard because he has never had anyone talk like that to him before.  He said he was not upset about it and that he did not care but I know it bothered him some.

He has already been talking about eventually looking for a different job, but now he really wants to find another one.  He does not have to have a job, but he of course likes having a little spending money for things he wants and he has saved over $2000.00.  

Here is my question where I need some advice:  How do I stop myself from confronting his manager?  I know it would be a bad idea but I am really upset.

Don't want to spend time with teen,"Since I'm working at home, and my teenager is been at home for the end of the school year and beyond, we've been stuck in the same house together a lot.  
Here's the thing. I really don't want to spend time with my teenager. It was okay when I came home at the end of the day, and I'd have to go over some of his school work with him, and maybe share a few words.  But with all this time together, it's become apparent that his interests and mine do not overlap. At all. We don't like the same movies. We don't like the same books (when he actually reads).

Handling a teenage girl attitude,"My wife and I have a blended family.  I have 3 boys (11, 14, and 18) from prior relationships and she has two girls and a boy.  We met when the girls were in their early to mid teen years.  Her oldest has left the house and now all we've got are my three boys and her 18 year old daughter.

To say that dealing with teenage girls is a shock to the system would be an understatement.  For the most part, when the girls have acted up I've tried to take it in stride.  Sometimes one succeeded, sometimes I haven't.  My problem is not taking it personally.  I don't like having my feelings hurt and it just seems like teenage girls can be so vicious sometimes 

Here's the problem - - if anyone ever tells my step-daughter that she hurt their feelings, she goes ballistic.  She'll yell, claim that HER feelings were hurt (presumably by virtue of being told she hurt someone's feelings?), and then alternate between attacking and silent treatment.

Here's a wrinkle - - my boys and I are highly intelligent.  Their mom and I are lawyers.  Which means the boys have superior language, critical thinking, and argument skills.  I'm not saying this to brag.  It's just the reality of two lawyers raising children.  My step-daughter has confessed to my wife that she is intimated by our intellect and she feels stupid in comparison. I don't see her as stupid at all and I've made sure to express that I'm proud of her and that she has the ability to do anything she wants in this world.  My boys and I never talk down to her.  We are cognizant and respectful of the insecurity.

The problem I'm having are these emotional outbursts.  You can't talk to her when it happens because she will simply never relent.  Ever.  She digs her heels in so deeply.  To top it off, her father abandoned her maybe 8 years ago.  So I don't know if there's also some latent resentment by virtue of our gender. 

I just have no idea how to handle this.  Personally, I just leave her alone to have her tantrums.  But when she comes hunting people down for a fight while we're talking in the living room, it's a real challenge.

So is this something I just have to weather until she grows up or moves out? Or is there really some way to talk to a teenage girl like this?",0,"Handling a teenage girl attitude My wife and I have a blended family.

Is it time to see a psychiatrist?,"My daughter is thirteen and has always had some problems with anxiety.  A few years ago, she saw a counselor to help address some of the anxiety.  After a while, the counselor and my husband and I mutually agreed that she could stop seeing the counselor.  Lately, I've been seeing signs that make me concerned.  Her anxiety levels are very high.  She's afraid to sleep in her room at night because she thinks someone might break in.  She's begun washing her hands way too often.  It's at the point that her hands look severely dried out.  We're a Catholic family and she's grown up in the church but lately she seems to have an unhealthy relationship with her faith.  She is very worried that she isn't good enough to go to heaven and she has started mentioning kind of weird things that she thinks might be a sin.  For example, the other day she asked me to read the bible with her but she wouldn't read it until she had clean hands because she was worried that reading the bible with dirty hands would be a sin.  We had an ice cream treat a few days ago and I noticed that she didn't eat very much of it.  I wasn't thinking anything about her anxiety but I just mentioned that I was shocked that she didn't want her ice cream (because normally she would have eaten every bite).  At first she kind of just shrugged me off but later she came up to me and asked me if I thought it was a sin for her to eat the ice cream.  We talked about it and I asked her why she would think it was a sin and she couldn't really explain.  There have been a few other strange things like that.  She seems to be having some intrusive thoughts that have me very worried.  I'm trying to decide what exactly we should do now.  We can go back to the counselor but I'm kind of worried that it might be time to look at something else like a psychologist or psychiatrist.  We have a family history of depression and anxiety on both sides and my husband and I both take medicine for this.  I respond very well to my medicine but my husband goes through phases.  I'm really thinking that it might be time for us to go a step further and see a psychiatrist.  I think I'm seeing signs of anxiety and maybe OCD.

How do we as parents feel about how the current events affect our children?,"Our house is kind of small and one of our son’s rooms is actually a modification of our dining room (we don’t use the room) with curtains for privacy. But, you can hear conversations if you’re passing by. It’s 4 AM and I was in the kitchen getting some water and my night owl (almost) 16-year-old son is on a group chat with a bunch of friends. I don’t normally even pay attention to his conversations but something caught my ear, and it was the topic of them dropping one of their (ex)friends because he has shown racist tendencies recently, and also made some pretty outrageous comments on social media about the current protests and movements. I am black and my kids’ dad is white. I am divorced, and my fiancé is white. My kids grew up never seeing color *at home*. And to be honest, all three of my children have a beautiful melting pot of friends. So many different races, cultures...such truly beautiful people. I love my kids’ friends. So, hearing my son engaged in this conversation with his friends about race, and the ongoing movement, and what it means to them and how they feel...I am truly thankful that they have each other to talk to about everything. That they have outlets to share and it never ends in bickering or fighting. They hear each other out and explain opinions but they all love each other. And I guess they’re not afraid to shut someone down that is behaving in a way that they find inappropriate. I wish they didn’t have to deal with this at such a young age. But I guess it is something that will be a part of the world, no matter how hard we try to make changes. I have my own stories of what I’ve experienced, but that’s for another post another time. I’m 38 and I have three absolutely amazing teenagers. I had them at a young age, and I raised them as I was growing up in a different world. I don’t know if it is naïve or not, but I never really thought they would be seeing and hearing the things that they are in the news and media that are so racially fueled, prompting them to examine their own ideals so early in life.

My parents get mad about the smallest things and it p*sses me the f*uck off.,"I’m 15 and am writing to see if parents have advice for me. My parents get mad about the smallest things and I might snap. For instance, my mom wanted me to do house work and I was like,” Sure! Let me get my headphones!” She looked at me with disgust and was like,”No. Get back here and do the stuff not.” 

For a little bit of background I have ADD and I find the easiest way to cope with it is to combine the thing I have to do with music. 

This action if getting my headphones would take less than 10 seconds at most and I don’t see why it would hinder me doing the task at all as I almost always do as I’m told. 

This happens a lot. Wether it’s me missing a little bit of dust or it’s me forgetting to pick up a LEGO price it’s the same.  

The strange thing is, my sister never gets in trouble either and I usually end up picking up her damn mess. And she’ll heckle me to and it makes me wish someone would literally slap her out of it.",0,"My parents get mad about the smallest things and it p*sses me the f*uck off.

Seeking perspectives on teens,"Hello,

I'm looking for some perspective, maybe even a sanity check. I'm 39, my wife is 35, for the purposes of this post I have three kids (15, 13, and 10). I have two others but they live with their mom in another state (they visit for a couple of months during the summer and a few weeks during the winter). 

I work in the military and when I get told that I need to work somewhere, I go and work there. My family can come with me in most cases. In this case, it wound up taking my family from one end of the country to the other (more or less, CO to VA). My 15 year old was in the middle of a relationship during that time. She considers herself dating the boy in CO while she's in VA.  
We've been here for about a year now. She keeps bringing up that she wants to visit her boyfriend in CO. She claims that his parents are perfectly okay with hosting her while she visits for a week or two during summer vacation. My wife and I are not okay with this prospect. We are not okay with her flying on her own to see a boyfriend. It....just seems like flimsy reason to sponsor a trip just to make my daughter happy.

I'm okay with all kinds of other options. The boy's family comes and visits, they can take in the DC monuments. I can't think of a reason to back to CO for any reason. I have some military friends there but I don't have time to visit anyone whenever I want. I'm okay with a trip to Disneyland (or some theme park) for the family and the boy visits with us. Or some other vacation-y thing that the entire family enjoys and the side benefit for 15 year old is that she sees her boyfriend.

   I don't know this boy's parents though. I know his dad is in the military and that's about it. I don't know anything about the mom except from what my wife tells me. The kids mom really wants to be the 'cool' mom is the impression I get. I don't really care if that is how she wants to do her stuff, I don't think I'm very strict by any sense of the word when it comes to my parenting style. This whole request seems more like a request to remove my brains from my head and throw them on the ground.  
My daughter herself hasn't been exactly a shining beacon of trust and responsibility, she comes off as a fairly average teen, to me at least. I wasn't that much better growing up and that is the only comparison I really have. I would not have trusted 15 year old me to fly across the states to visit with a girlfriend. That isn't her experience though. My wife's perspective is that the boyfriend's parents are not okay with their son traveling the country on his own, so why in the world would my wife allow our daughter to travel. That makes sense too.  
So, sanity check, am I crazy for thinking that it is irresponsible to allow my daughter to travel the country on her own to visit her boyfriend with parents that I don't know? So far, I don't think so.   
   How should I express this to my teen without tearing her down or crushing her hopes. I don't want to give any kind of false promise. My wife seems to think that my approach is fairly abrasive and not empathetic so I'm not trying to get into it. Wife seems to portray what I'm thinking and feeling without being so blunt with people.

Well, what are y'alls thoughts? I appreciate any input.",0,"Seeking perspectives on teens Hello,  I'm looking for some perspective, maybe even a sanity check.

My kids want to protest but I am worried about their safety. Am I overreacting?,"My older two kids (18 year old daughter, 15 year old son) want to attend a protest in our area later this week. It is about an hour away. I have some concerns. The biggest one being that my husband has a rare medical disorder and we are unsure how he would be affected by Covid. Our state was hit pretty hard. The idea of the kids being near thousands of people worries me even if everyone is wearing a mask. My second concern is for their safety. I have heard about these protest getting out of hand and I don't want them to get hurt. My 18 year old argues that if this happened while she was away at school then I wouldn't even know if she protested because she goes to college on the other side of the country. I get that but if she was still away at school she wouldn't be bringing her 15 year old brother with her nor would she be risking bringing home something her dad. Both kids say they can quarantine at my daughter's biological dad's house after the protest and, while I know he wouldn't mind, I really don't want to be unable to see my kids for 2 weeks. 

I am not concerned about their reasons for wanting to do it. My kids have made those reasons clear and my 15 year old is the more politically active of the two so I know he knows what he's getting into but I am still worried about illness and violence.

Grandma tried and failed to make a difference in an unwanted child’s life but...,"...she has worn me down. Now , How do I help my granddaughter deal with her half sister moving? I agreed to keep them both for a summer. That was two years ago. The half sister is now 13 years old and very troubled. My granddaughter is 7 years old. I let the stay extend but now I cannot handle the older sister anymore. First I can’t afford it. It’s expensive to raise children. Second she steals lies and manipulated. I found myself crying because there is nothing I can do. I’ve tried talking to her and buying books to help discussions. I don’t have the time to take her to therapy which she would probably need three times a week. I work full time. I seriously think she needs intensive therapy. I feel bad because that behavior came from somewhere and it’s sad. There are great people who have the skills and time to help her. Now I just want her to leave. I talked to the mom
And she won’t even give me her address. My next step is to try and convince her grandma to care for her. I am concerned about my granddaughter. She’s going to miss her.

Now , How do I help my granddaughter deal with her half sister moving? I agreed to keep them both for a summer. That was two years ago. The half sister is now years old and very troubled. My granddaughter is years old. I let the stay extend but now I cannot handle the older sister anymore. First I can’t afford it. It’s expensive to raise children. Second she steals lies and manipulated. I found myself crying because there is nothing I can do. I’ve tried talking to her and buying books to help discussions. I don’t have the time to take her to therapy which she would probably need three times a week. I work full time. I seriously think she needs intensive therapy. I feel bad because that behavior came from somewhere and it’s sad. There are great people who have the skills and time to help her. Now I just want her to leave. I talked to the mom And she won’t even give me her address. My next step is to try and convince her grandma to care for her. I am concerned about my granddaughter. She’s going to miss her.

Am I being unreasonable about setting laundry rules? Quarantine may have us a little crazy,"I have 3 teenagers. My 16 year old has been doing what I consider to be an unreasonable amount of laundry. My kids have always had lot of laundry (school clothes, gym clothes, sports uniforms, and night time clothes for each kid) but with them no longer having gym clothes or sports uniforms I figured our laundry would slow down a little. My 16 year old is still doing laundry twice a week. He has enough clothes to last him more than 2 weeks even if he never washed anything so this isn't a lack of clothes. Today he did laundry because he wanted to wear the jeans and shirt he wore Monday. He has plenty of other clothes to wear but he wants to wear that specific outfit. I didn't catch it until I got home from work and we got into yet another argument about his overuse of the washing machine. I feel like it waste water and detergent and also prevents other people from doing laundry when they want because he's hogging the machines. I told him that if he wants to do laundry so much then the least he can do is buy his own laundry detergent and fabric softener and, if he already did laundry that week, to check with everyone else to make sure they don't have laundry to do first. He of course thinks that I am overreacting but went out to go buy laundry detergent. Am I being unreasonable here?

Parenting an only child who is a pre-teen while living in a rural area during isolation,"This isolation is taking such a toll

I'm working from home 5 days a week, at least 8 hours of the day

My 13 year old does school work until about noon 

My husband (her father) sleeps during the day and works long hours at night - a new schedule due to covid related reason

We just got past nine months of winter and it's beautiful outside but everything in the state is closed

We have gone on trails, we've been gardening, we've done long walks, and a few other things outside but I am at wits end with parenting at this point.

How do you work all day while making sure your kid is also not getting lonely, is getting enough sun, is getting enough exercise, etc? 

She won't go outside and play by herself and although we have a huge lawn, there is nothing for her to do out there all alone. But when I am finally done with work for the day I have to immediately go into the kitchen and start getting dinner ready then spend the evening cooking and cleaning.

My (39F) daughter (16) always pretends to have something wrong with her.,"First, I’ve never said anything to her about any of this. I always hope it just plays out. I know teenagers are figuring out themselves and the world and do dumb stuff. I don’t want to embarrass her. 

As long as I can remember she has been creating these “things” to try to get attention. She very rarely does them around us, only at school. Like for a while she pretended she was clumsy. So she’d fall constantly. A few months later she was magically cured and then she was terrified of everything. If there was a noise she’d jump and audibly react and throw herself around like it was the scariest thing ever.  She was the girl that cries all the time for a while. She isn’t clumsy. She isn’t easily startled. She doesn’t cry constantly. And at home these things didn’t happen.

It seemed for a while like she stopped doing these things and now she suddenly has a stutter or speech impediment or something. I don’t know what to call it. She will be talking and say “Can I bo b b b b b b b b orrow your pen p p p p p p p p p p encil?” And she’ll tilt her head and act like she’s struggling. But she isn’t. It’s fake. She’s healthy. She has never had speech issues. It’s one of her fake “things.”

I never say anything because I don’t want to bring attention to it. And I’m not concerned about the actions being real and her needing a doctor because they are clearly fake. (She isn’t exactly good at pretending these things.)

Since everything is shut down she was having to do her classes over video and I would hear her fake stuttering. I know everyone has moments where their brain just sort of hiccups but they move on. So I figured it was that. Then I started realizing it was constant when she was on these video sessions. But she’d come out and talk to us and it wouldn’t happen. Until she realized I’d heard her. Now it’s all the damn time. And you can almost see her planning it when she talks to us. But she’ll go in her room and be hanging out with a sibling and it won’t happen. 

I know for a fact it’s that fake crap she does.

Would you ignore it? Or would you say something?

I usually lean towards ignoring it but she just started working. And now all I can think is she’s at this new job and acting like she can’t speak. Having an employee that “can’t” talk to customers isn’t exactly something an employer is going to deal with.

15 year old Stepson spiraling out of control," 

Ok, this is going to be long because there's a lot of back story. Here goes:

I've been with my partner for 6 years, living together for 4 and a half. I have two boys (13 and 11) from a previous relationship, he has one boy (now 15) that I will call John for the purpose of this post.

When we met I shared 50/50 custody with my ex - which is still the case - and we have a very amicable arrangement and are friendly towards each other. He, on the other hand had a very toxic relationship with his ex and she had custody and lived in a small town 2 hours away. He had his boy every second weekend. When we met this arrangement had been going on for 18 months. Before that he shared 50/50 custody and although he and his ex didn't get on that well, they were civil and the custody arrangement was going well.

What changed was she decided she wanted a fresh start with her new partner and baby and got a job transfer to this new town and wanted to take John (then 9) with her. My partner was against this and a very nasty and bitter court custody battle ensued, which she won.

Previous to having John, my partner and his ex had a very volatile relationship. They were both drug users, heavy drinkers and there was abuse and terrible behaviour on both sides. When I met my partner he had cleaned up his act a lot, was not using drugs, was totally non violent but still drank quite a lot. Now, 6 years later he is a light drinker and a much happier person.

During the custody battle, there was a lot of mud slung from both sides and John was subject to hearing both of his parents bad mouth the other one and was exposed to things no child should be exposed to. He was caught in a tug of war and I believe that's where the trouble started.

When John was 12 he expressed and interest to us that he wanted to come and live with us and do High School in the city. He was coming out as gay, was/is very creative and a little flamboyant and was getting bullied at his school. He thought a bigger city with a high school that put emphasis on things like drama and music would suit him and we agreed. Also, over the 2 and a half years I had known him he had been telling us quite concerning things about his home life. For example, his mother had 3 different partners in the space of 2 years that she moved in with - one of them was a white supremacist, which horrified us, she ended up having to get a restraining order against him; she didn't get up in the morning to get John or his sister off to school; she lost her job due to one of her partners trying to sell drugs to her clients. We really wanted to get him out of there but knew a court case would be expensive and not necessarily go in our favour.

My partner asked his ex if John could come and live with us and she point blank refused. She claimed he didn't want to and we were putting words in his head and trying to poison him against her.

Eventually we decided we had to go ahead with a court case to try and get custody as we were really concerned about his home life. After putting in the application to the court the judge ordered us to have a mediation to try and work it out first.

Needless to say, this didn't work and was the worst experience of my life. My partner's ex is the most toxic, derranged and impossible person I've ever met who is more interested in fighting and winning than what is best for her child. The mediator could not control her at all - at one point she was leaning over the table pointing her finger in my face while screaming at me. After that mediation we decided we did not have the mental fortitude to carry on with a court case. We did come to one agreement. That after another year had passed if John was still saying he wanted to come and live with us, he could. Neither of us had any faith that would happen.

That mediation happened in January of 2018. In February of that year I was away working when my partner called my at 9.30 on a wednesday night and told me that he had had a call from the police station in the town where John lived saying John was at the police station, was refusing to go home to his mother and could my partner come and pick him up. He was understandably stressed and couldn't actually go and get him as my two boys were in bed asleep.

John had walked to the police station and told them his mother and her partner were off their heads on prescription drugs and alcohol and had been driving John and his sister around. The police went to check on them and found they were wasted. Apparently John had been withholding information about just how bad his mother was, but she was totally addicted to prescription pills and alcohol.

By the time we figured out somewhere he could stay the night (a friend of an acquaintance) it was nearly midnight. The next day my partner drove to pick him up and put in an urgent custody application to the court which was accepted and voila, we had John living with us. The whole thing was extremely stressful but we were glad to have him out of there and with us.

He was enrolled in school and we got him some counselling sessions and he seemed to be going great, but we were both prepared for something down the track as a kid doesn't go through something like that and turn out unscathed.

For two years everything was peaceful, except John didn't see his mother for a year and she sent him some pretty nasty emails. Then they picked up contact and he would see her from time to time and she seemed to be being an ok mother but still never apologised to him and had the nerve to say that he owed her an apology!

So he was going along at school well, he was learning piano and was generally a happy and polite kid. He was making friends and would hang out with them after school, although he never brought any friends home (even though we asked him to) so we never met any.

At the beginning of this year he started spending way more time in his room but we figured that's normal for a teenager. He really only came out of his room for food but he still always seemed happy and we did check in on his mental state from time to time, and he always said he was fine.

In Feb of this year we discovered he had been cutting himself. He broke down and said he had bad thoughts in his head and he thought he needed help. We comforted him, said it was normal and that we would get him help. I was looking for a suitable counsellor and found an online psyhcologist that had great reviews and he started the sessions.

Then we discovered that he had been missing school - like a lot of school. He had only been to about 3 classes in the past two weeks. When we confronted him he became agitated and said he 'couldn't deal with us' and he was going for a walk. After an hour we were a bit concerned and my partner went looking for him but didn't see him. It was getting dark and we were getting worried. He then texted saying he needed to see his mother and she was driving down from her town and he was going to stay with her at her parents (who live in our city) for a few days. We said ok, becasue what else could we do? He kept missing school though and we received a barrage of txts from her saying our parenting clearly wasn't working and she was going to report us blah blah blah. We ignored them. John said he would come back after a couple of days but then kept saying he was staying another night and still not going to school. It was very frustrating as short of going over there and dragging him back there was nothing we could do. We made a meeting with the school and John promised he would start going to classes again, but he wasn't ready to come home. He started to go to one class a day. After being with his grandparents for about 10 days he came home. Basically the grandparents didn't want him there and his mum had gone back to her town so I guess he thought he should come home. He walked in the door and burst into tears and we just hugged him and said it was all ok. The the lockdown was announced to start on 20th March. Lockdown was a blessing - he was doing his schoolwork online, he was going for walks, he was doing he psychology sessions and he said he was feeling great. He said he was looking forward to going to school and that it was going to be a great term. He said he wanted to try being a rebel but it wasn't really him and he wanted to go back to being his normal self. We were so relieved.

Schools where I am (not in the US) started back on the 18th May.

On the Friday before school was due to start he went into town to meet some friends (they were desperate to hook up after lockdown was lifted). He was happy and in a good mood. He said goodbye to me and that he'd be back in the evening as they were going to have dinner together.

About 6.30 he texted to say he was going to stay the night with one of his friends. We said, ok, but we need the number of the parent in charge (which is one of our rules if he stays over somewhere, and he knows that). He said he'd get it soon but 30 minutes passed and no number. We then get a call from someone who is clearly a child pretending to be an adult to say John could stay at her house. Of course we didn't fall for that and texted John to say he better either get a parents number or come home. Neither happened. The next day, my partner rang him t see where he was and for him to come home. He said he wasn't coming home and wanted to spend the night at his grandparents. We said ok, because again, what else can you do? On the Sunday we rang him to say we expected him home by 5pm as he had school the next day. He said he wanted to spend another night with his grandparents.

We were getting pissed off with him by this stage - he had no clothes with him, no toothbrush, no school books and we wanted him home! He point blank refused. My partner rang the grandparents (who are just as horrible as his mother) and said we were not giving him permission to stay the night.

They must have told him he couldn't stay because we then got a message from him saying he was 'helping a friend with schoolwork' and was going to stay there. My partner was apoplectic by then and we told him that he needed to get his arse home pronto.

He refused and said he would be home Monday after school and he would take the consequences.

We couldn't believe what this kid was doing. The next day he got home about 5.30 after school.

He said nothing but 'I'm going to my room"". I said, ok, but you're losing your phone as a consequence of what you've done this weekend and he just said 'no, you're not taking it'.

A pretty big argument ensued, with him refusing to give up his phone or explain his actions. He said 'I'm going for a walk"", we said, 'like hell, last time you went for a walk you didn't come home for 10 days, you can stay in here and think about things.

We left him in his room to think about what he wanted to happen.

5 minutes later he walked downstairs with a backpack and said he wanted to go and live with his grandparents and they were on their way to pick him up. I tried to block the door but after a while we just had to let him go. It was shit and we still don't understand why.

That was 8 days ago and he hasn't been going to school or contacting us.

My partner rang mental health services to see if we can get him an appointment and somehow they had on their records that he was brought home by the police back in march when he was staying at the grandparents the first time for being drunk and naked in the middle of the road. We didn't even know he was drinking. The f\*cking grandparents didn't feel the need to tell us this.

Now he is posting all over instagram videos of him smoking and vaping. He has a boyfriend we know nothing about and basically has turned into a different person.

We are super worried about him but also really pissed off!

If you got to the end you are my hero.

What can we do? We live in New Zealand btw.

I'm not even reading this back, so hope it makes sense.",0,"year old Stepson spiraling out of control    Ok, this is going to be long because there's a lot of back story. Here goes:  I've been with my partner for years, living together for and a half. I have two boys (and 11) from a previous relationship, he has one boy (now 15) that I will call John for the purpose of this post.  When we met I shared 50/custody with my ex - which is still the case - and we have a very amicable arrangement and are friendly towards each other. He, on the other hand had a very toxic relationship with his ex and she had custody and lived in a small town hours away. He had his boy every second weekend. When we met this arrangement had been going on for months. Before that he shared 50/custody and although he and his ex didn't get on that well, they were civil and the custody arrangement was going well.  What changed was she decided she wanted a fresh start with her new partner and baby and got a job transfer to this new town and wanted to take John (then 9) with her. My partner was against this and a very nasty and bitter court custody battle ensued, which she won.  Previous to having John, my partner and his ex had a very volatile relationship. They were both drug users, heavy drinkers and there was abuse and terrible behaviour on both sides. When I met my partner he had cleaned up his act a lot, was not using drugs, was totally non violent but still drank quite a lot. Now, years later he is a light drinker and a much happier person.  During the custody battle, there was a lot of mud slung from both sides and John was subject to hearing both of his parents bad mouth the other one and was exposed to things no child should be exposed to. He was caught in a tug of war and I believe that's where the trouble started.  When John was he expressed and interest to us that he wanted to come and live with us and do High School in the city. He was coming out as gay, was/is very creative and a little flamboyant and was getting bullied at his school. He thought a bigger city with a high school that put emphasis on things like drama and music would suit him and we agreed. Also, over the and a half years I had known him he had been telling us quite concerning things about his home life. For example, his mother had different partners in the space of years that she moved in with - one of them was a white supremacist, which horrified us, she ended up having to get a restraining order against him; she didn't get up in the morning to get John or his sister off to school; she lost her job due to one of her partners trying to sell drugs to her clients. We really wanted to get him out of there but knew a court case would be expensive and not necessarily go in our favour.  My partner asked his ex if John could come and live with us and she point blank refused. She claimed he didn't want to and we were putting words in his head and trying to poison him against her.  Eventually we decided we had to go ahead with a court case to try and get custody as we were really concerned about his home life. After putting in the application to the court the judge ordered us to have a mediation to try and work it out first.  Needless to say, this didn't work and was the worst experience of my life. My partner's ex is the most toxic, derranged and impossible person I've ever met who is more interested in fighting and winning than what is best for her child. The mediator could not control her at all - at one point she was leaning over the table pointing her finger in my face while screaming at me. After that mediation we decided we did not have the mental fortitude to carry on with a court case. We did come to one agreement. That after another year had passed if John was still saying he wanted to come and live with us, he could. Neither of us had any faith that would happen.  That mediation happened in January of 2018. In February of that year I was away working when my partner called my at 9.on a wednesday night and told me that he had had a call from the police station in the town where John lived saying John was at the police station, was refusing to go home to his mother and could my partner come and pick him up. He was understandably stressed and couldn't actually go and get him as my two boys were in bed asleep.  John had walked to the police station and told them his mother and her partner were off their heads on prescription drugs and alcohol and had been driving John and his sister around. The police went to check on them and found they were wasted. Apparently John had been withholding information about just how bad his mother was, but she was totally addicted to prescription pills and alcohol.  By the time we figured out somewhere he could stay the night (a friend of an acquaintance) it was nearly midnight. The next day my partner drove to pick him up and put in an urgent custody application to the court which was accepted and voila, we had John living with us. The whole thing was extremely stressful but we were glad to have him out of there and with us.  He was enrolled in school and we got him some counselling sessions and he seemed to be going great, but we were both prepared for something down the track as a kid doesn't go through something like that and turn out unscathed.  For two years everything was peaceful, except John didn't see his mother for a year and she sent him some pretty nasty emails. Then they picked up contact and he would see her from time to time and she seemed to be being an ok mother but still never apologised to him and had the nerve to say that he owed her an apology!  So he was going along at school well, he was learning piano and was generally a happy and polite kid. He was making friends and would hang out with them after school, although he never brought any friends home (even though we asked him to) so we never met any.  At the beginning of this year he started spending way more time in his room but we figured that's normal for a teenager. He really only came out of his room for food but he still always seemed happy and we did check in on his mental state from time to time, and he always said he was fine.  In Feb of this year we discovered he had been cutting himself. He broke down and said he had bad thoughts in his head and he thought he needed help. We comforted him, said it was normal and that we would get him help. I was looking for a suitable counsellor and found an online psyhcologist that had great reviews and he started the sessions.  Then we discovered that he had been missing school - like a lot of school. He had only been to about classes in the past two weeks. When we confronted him he became agitated and said he 'couldn't deal with us' and he was going for a walk. After an hour we were a bit concerned and my partner went looking for him but didn't see him. It was getting dark and we were getting worried. He then texted saying he needed to see his mother and she was driving down from her town and he was going to stay with her at her parents (who live in our city) for a few days. We said ok, becasue what else could we do? He kept missing school though and we received a barrage of txts from her saying our parenting clearly wasn't working and she was going to report us blah blah blah. We ignored them. John said he would come back after a couple of days but then kept saying he was staying another night and still not going to school. It was very frustrating as short of going over there and dragging him back there was nothing we could do. We made a meeting with the school and John promised he would start going to classes again, but he wasn't ready to come home. He started to go to one class a day. After being with his grandparents for about days he came home. Basically the grandparents didn't want him there and his mum had gone back to her town so I guess he thought he should come home.

We are two completely different people with different interests, dreams and goals. Now it’s school, but in few years we might live in different countries. We promised each other that we will follow our dreams but we will always be there for each other and stay best friends. We know that if if we choose the same path one will be miserable and then is out of the question. I think that this is where our shared road ends and we go our separate ways.

Do I force my son to attend vocational school?,"   Question is fairly straight-forward.  He's a C-student for the most part, unmotivated.  Starts high school next year.  We went to the local vocational school open house, it seemed like a good fit and he seemed interested.  He got accepted, and theattitude just changed to a hard ""I don't want to go, nothing is interesting to me there""

   Maybe he will turn it around, but college just feels like a long shot at this point, so the vocational path seems like such a better option.  It fees like the vocational school is safest, hedging for the future.  But he's adamant about not going, and I have tried over and over to sell it.  If you have a teenager, I don't have to tell you how well those conversations went.  But despite my own belief that it would be better for him in the long run, I'm extremely hesitant to take away his choice.

   His mother thinks we should just accept the invitation and make him go.  I see it as a waste of time, it will build resentment and he could be just as unmotivated there, if not moreso out of spite.  My thought was let him make his own choice, despite being clueless at 14, but to support him.  He and I have talked about how he will need to work harder, do activities, cut back on the gaming, he seems on board, but of course it's easy to support something that's five months away.  I'm also ignoring the possibility that there could still be remote classes in the fall which would destroy the first year hands-o part of the program, so I'm leaving that factor out of this discussion (plus I dont want a masks vs no-masks thread)

game addict teen and oblivious parents,"My sister-in-law's son (15M) is a game addict. He'll spend all day in his dark room playing games, sometimes staying up t0 2-4am gaming. She's tried setting a curfew of 12 midnight,  and he needs to get all his schoolwork done, which I think is pretty reasonable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just last week, when he was up at 3 am gaming, his parents shut off the wifi after asking him to go to bed multiple times. When I asked him about it, he said he was working on a assignment for his AP class in between gaming, and couldn't submit it due to some technical issues with the school site. He tried contacting his teachers, but never got a response before wifi was shut off. I guess there was other bouts of arguments before, and this was the tipping point for him. The next day he left the house to wonder around the neighborhood, with his parents going after him begging him to return home. A cop showed up, asking what was going on, and he told them he was thinking about suicide because of depression. This caused them to admit him to a hospital, where he stayed for 4 days. Nothing really came out of it, no helpful notes from the therapists besides depression, and he needs boundaries.

Anyone else have twins who never developed different friend groups or interest?,"I am not super concerned but wanted to ask anyway. I have 4 boys and the older two are twins. They are 17 years old and finishing their junior years in high school. They are identical twins and have very similar personalities. They have always pretty much had the same friend groups. I don't think any of them has one friend who isn't at least ""cool"" with the other twin. They do some separate things. Both are in orchestra but they play different instruments; viola vs cello. They do some different sports. They both do baseball and swimming but one does cross country running and the other does football. They do StuCo together, one as class president and one as school board rep, but one does Model UN and Debate while the other does Science Bowl and Robotics. They have some of the same classes together. We put them in different classes in elementary but once they got to junior high they started having classes together. This year was the most. They had 5 classes together. They are forced to spend a lot of time together but even when they aren't forced into it they usually end up hanging out anyway.

I have boys and the older two are twins. They are years old and finishing their junior years in high school. They are identical twins and have very similar personalities. They have always pretty much had the same friend groups. I don't think any of them has one friend who isn't at least ""cool"" with the other twin. They do some separate things. Both are in orchestra but they play different instruments; viola vs cello. They do some different sports. They both do baseball and swimming but one does cross country running and the other does football. They do StuCo together, one as class president and one as school board rep, but one does Model UN and Debate while the other does Science Bowl and Robotics. They have some of the same classes together. We put them in different classes in elementary but once they got to junior high they started having classes together. This year was the most. They had classes together. They are forced to spend a lot of time together but even when they aren't forced into it they usually end up hanging out anyway.

"Parents of kids who may not be college bound, how are you preparing your kids for future?","I want to start by saying that I don't believe every single student should go to college. I have 3 kids. I am confident my middle will want to attend college, with my youngest it's too early to tell, but my oldest has never been a ""school kid."" Without going into too much detail he struggles with anxiety and depression. We are getting him help but it's a long road. He was happy as a clam when school moved online and is hoping school is online to start next year. He wants to graduate high school but has no real goals outside of that. He'll finish his freshman year at the end of next month so I know there is plenty of time for him to change but we are preparing for the very real possibility that he won't attend college.

Do I get involved with subpar friends?,"So my son turned 15 today. Can’t believe how fast the time went. This week my ex and I let him choose how he would like to spend the day between home and friends, and promised to give him the best experience we could despite the lockdown. He made arrangements to have a virtual party by playing video games online with a couple friends in the evening. So we all moved around our schedules to make it happen for him. 

He gets online as planned in the evening and both friends aren’t there. Neither show up for an hour. They play for a little bit but apparently forgot that it was his birthday, and log off unceremoniously after 30 minutes. No goodbye, no text that explains their departure, no birthdays wishes — they just log off. So I obviously spent the evening with my boy watching him play to make him feel better. Thank god he is still close with his younger brother, who eventually stepped up to fill the void so they could play together. 

Now these are average selfish teenage boys and they almost certainly don’t mean anything malicious by it. They just don’t give a crap about anything that’s not in their immediate interest. My son likes them as friends but I do see a pattern of this kind of careless shitbaggery. He was obviously hurt by the situation and I kind of want to step in and excise them from his life. I’m not sure that’s good for him though - I want him to fight his battles and learn to make his decisions. But I also want to protect my son from assholes who will erode his confidence.

How can I Help my daughter (14) learn empathy.,"My BIL passed away suddenly this last Tuesday. Of course my wife is absolutely broken up about this. She is a strong woman and is handling it as best she can. Yesterday she and my daughter went out to get dinner. On the way back my wife wanted to share a funny story about her brother. My daughter told her she didn’t want to talk about him. This greatly upset my wife and she started to cry.
 
Little background on my daughter. She (and wife) suffers from depression and anxiety. She seems to only care about her own feelings. She’s in therapy and on medications. She just can’t seem to understand that we all have feelings and while hers are important we can’t put our feelings or lives on hold to only cater to hers. And she shuts down when we try and talk to her about them. 

Years ago my son almost drowned and it was traumatic for all of us. While talking last night she brought up how we demeaned her during this drowning incident. I was holding my son in my arms after saving him and made her get out of the pool and had a relative take her to their room so she wouldn’t possibly see him die. I was protecting her. But all she sees is me demeaning her. She can’t understand that we all have feelings and what we were possibly going through during this time.

My 19 y/o son was 5150’d for psychotic episode,"He graduated from high school this month. 

I don’t know exactly what triggered it. He was taking Prozac for his depression and seemed to be doing well. Working thirty hours a week during the shutdown. Got good grades. We never insisted that he take meds or work. School was his job. Since he got good grades while working we thought he was fine. 

Sometime in February he started smoking pot every day. Kids at school were asking him if he was okay because he was so lethargic. He decided to switch to smoking thc oil instead and occasionally took dxm, which is a cough syrup.
He told me on a Thursday all this and that he needed to quit work because the managers smoke pot with the crew and he needed to make positive changes in his life. My husband and I fully supported him. How could we not? 

He was unable to sleep and as the week progressed he because manic. Sometimes he made sense and other times he didn’t. His rants easily could have been posts on Twitter. “I saw this coming!! It’s a new beginning! Moving forward!!”  We convinced him to get an assessment and they told us an appointment to a psychiatrist would take a week but worst case, take him to the ER. We came home and that night and went to bed. My son decided to get the Neuralink. (That’s Elon Musk. His delusions ranged from Elon Musk, Andrew Yang and Hannibal Barca.) He took my car around 2am and drove to a college the next town over. He was walking around in a university parking deck looking for the Neuralink. Thankfully the university police recognized him being manic and called his dad. I’m certain if they just sent him on his way the outcome would have been so much worse. My husband took him to the hospital and that’s where he was involuntary committed  and sent to a mental hospital an hour away. 

I’m only sharing this to maybe help others. This is the beginning for us; who knows when or if he will get better. My uneducated opinion thinks he has a cannabis induced psychosis but who knows. Maybe schizophrenia, bipolar. Time will tell. 

Of course I feel like the worst parent ever.  My heart breaks for my son that he was suffering but didn’t come to us. I can’t imagine how he feels. I know he needs help and he is where he belongs but the mom side of me wants to break him out and just hold him. 

I spoke to him last night and I can’t remember exactly what I said but he responded by yelling “The future will heal us!” So, I’m holding on to that.

Home schooling is getting hard - 15yo DGAF,"My son is struggling with the lockdown, as most kids would be - missing his mates and girlfriend - but he's become lazy and (more) obnoxious.

15 yo - in year 9 - they say it's the difficult year.   He just wants to play video games all day - barely cares about any schoolwork or homework - and - doesn't even step outside to play basketball or go for a walk.

My wife and I are trying everything we can to be supportive - and help him in ways - but he needs to step up.   It's like we're leading a horse to water - but no drinking is happening.

He's his own worst enemy - says that he doesn't care - we've taken away games/phone before - but he slips back to the old behaviour again.

He's a good kid at heart - but he's kinda lost - and we can't get him motivated.   Schools are likely to be closed for another 2-3 weeks here (Australia) - I guess there's light at the end of the tunnel.

But - he's gotta wake up and give-a-shit sooner or later, right ??",0,"Home schooling is getting hard - 15yo DGAF My son is struggling with the lockdown, as most kids would be - missing his mates and girlfriend - but he's become lazy and (more) obnoxious.  yo - in year - they say it's the difficult year.

Encouragement for daughter after major let down,"Today has been a doozy of a day at my house. Last week award notices for my daughter's school went out. She ended up having the highest GPA (along with other things) for her class/grade. Typically, this would have put her in top position for Valedictorian as we were told by her principal.

 Today, top ten results were released, and despite top scores and grades for her class, and ranking number 2 out of the whole district, the school ranked her #4. She is devastated. I don't know what to say to her, other than to be proud of her accomplishments and that sometimes, you get screwed over in life (not very sensitive, I know). We are proud of her and truthfully, I don't want her to need the validation of other people. I would rather her have pride in herself.

Last week award notices for my daughter's school went out. She ended up having the highest GPA (along with other things) for her class/grade. Typically, this would have put her in top position for Valedictorian as we were told by her principal.   Today, top ten results were released, and despite top scores and grades for her class, and ranking number out of the whole district, the school ranked her #4. She is devastated. I don't know what to say to her, other than to be proud of her accomplishments and that sometimes, you get screwed over in life (not very sensitive, I know). We are proud of her and truthfully, I don't want her to need the validation of other people. I would rather her have pride in herself.

Teens and dating. How to give privacy while still respecting boundaries?,"My 16 year old is dating. My oldest is a senior but didn't date in high school so this is all very new to us. My 16 year old son's girlfriend hasn't been over since our state shutdown but they have been FaceTiming and texting everyday and eventually she'll be allowed back over here. They have weirdly gotten even closer through being separated so I am little unsure of how to handle everything. 

When she used to come over her parents made it clear that they did not want her in my son's bedroom. My son shares a room with his younger brother so he wasn't super intent on spending time with his girlfriend in there anyway. Instead they would spend time in the family room, in the basement, which is somewhat private but people walk in and out all the time, or in our yard. They don't really spend time at her house because they say her parents make sure they stay within eye sight at all times but now my son is asking for more privacy at the house. He is fine with the bedroom being off limits because he doesn't want to violate her parents trust but he has asked if they could have the backyard to themselves for an hour or so when she's over here. I told him that's fine with me as long as his siblings agree and he said he'll work on that. 

Now I am wondering if I violated the parenting code. Her parents know we don't supervise as closely as they do and I feel like allowing them in the backyard, where I can see them if I look out my bedroom, dining room, or kitchen windows, is reasonable at their ages. I think they just want a place to go when they want to be alone for a while. How the hell does everyone else manage this?

"Just found out, now what?","My son just turned 15 and he has a girlfriend who will be 15 soon. My son does his own laundry. His clothes needed to go in the drier so I figured I’d just do it for him. I found an empty condom wrapper. I called my husband in to see and he talked to our son. Later we both talked to him. We have open communication with our son. Heck just this morning before the weaker incident I was reminding him that he could talk to me about anything and asked if he felt interested in sex and when he feels ready how he needs to come to be or even leave a note on my pillow if ge felt uncomfortable. 

...anyways. This all happened while he and his gf were under the watch of her parents. I know teens will find a way and apparently they did. One time. I’m frustrated because the gf mom told me she had rules and wouldn’t allow the kids in the gf room. That was all true until recently apparently. 

I don’t feel I should say anything to the girls parents but I told my son to tell her she should talk to her parents. I don’t know if this is the right decision but I’m curious how others have handled this. It’s unsettle especially because they’re so young.

"Struggling with how to handle toxic, self destructive behavior","I'm a single father with shared custody of our 14 year old daughter. Fortunately, her mother and I have a fairly good parenting relationship or this situation would be even more challenging to deal with.

It all started approximately one year ago, our daughter sneaked out of her mom's house and stole her car. She then proceeded to pick up several other teens for a late night joy ride that included drinking and drugs. The cops noticed the odd driving patterns of the vehicle and pulled them over. She was arrested and received a six month probation term. Up until this point we were very trusting of her but we were forced to do some investigating and it revealed that drugs, alcohol and unprotected sex had been ongoing for sometime. As a result we were forced to take very restrictive measures, seek out counseling for her and help ensure she completed her probation successfully.

Over the course of the last year she had completed all her requirements and had made great strides in earning our trust back. We moved forward with trusting her and giving her back those privileges that she had lost. Sadly, we recently noticed some inconsistencies in her behavior and decided to do some investigating. We found out that she's been engaging in similar destructive behavior once again (alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex, distributing nude photos, etc...). We are back to square one after an entire year of this process. I feel very gullible and deceived by all of this. It's also very disheartening that her biggest concern is her loss of access to phone, friends, etc... with no concern for the people she's hurt or her own health and well being. After reviewing the content on her phone I found that she seems to have this infatuation with the gangster lifestyle that is often depicted in rap/hip-hop culture and so she is trying to emulate that lifestyle.

I am unsure of how I should handle this situation going forward. I feel like I let her down and the past year of progress was just washed away. I love my daughter but I do not like the person that she currently is. I would love some feedback on possible approaches to this situation or some insight from parents who have navigated this before. Let me know if there are any other important details that I've left out and I'll be happy to edit my post.",0,"Struggling with how to handle toxic, self destructive behavior I'm a single father with shared custody of our year old daughter.

18yr old daughter left the country to be with a boy she met on Fortnite.,"I'm scared and need your advice please.

This past March, my daughter turned 18 and applied for her passport. The day it arrived, she booked a flight to Texas USA to be with a boy she met online. All without us knowing. We are from Canada.


I woke up at about 4am that morning and seen a note on the kitchen table. We had no idea what time she left but we chased after her. When we got to the airport and finally figured out where to go we missed her by just a few minutes. She was already passed security check point but only about 20 yards away. We couldn't go through without a passport (in our hurry we didn't even think about bringing them) We screamed for her to stop but she just turned her back to us. Border officers interviewed us and my daughter and looked up the person that she was going to go see. We brought the letter she wrote, there was nothing in there showing that she was planning to stay (she had a return flight booked) so they let her go. There was absolutely nothing that we could do.


Thankfully she stayed in touch when she got there. 

We figured there was no way she would come back right away, so we waited until after the date of the return flight and we flew out there without telling her. We met the family. Thankfully everyone 'seemed' normal. Very religious but a normal family i guess. They were all very accepting of what the two kids were doing. Almost encouraging it. His entire family just gave examples of what they did when they were young. 

As you can guess, she would not come back with us. She rebooked her flight for a much later date.



Now we skip to today....

She sent us a picture of their marriage license and they are getting married tomorrow.

Her boyfriend is very manipulative. He uses religion when he wants to or ignores it when he doesn't. Now, she says weird things like ""see you in heaven"". No matter what we say, nothing works. She doesn't see anything wrong with what she is doing and that she is 'sorry' that she may only see us once a year if we visit.

She pushed everything away. Her friends and her family. Our other daughter is so crushed. In just a short time, she has broken our hearts deeply. She was an incredible person. We used to be so close. This is so crazy what she has done. We can't make sense of it. I am incredibly scared for her. None of this is right.

My wife was talking to her about the marriage thing and twice my daughter mentioned that it will help her get a green card. This was all in text messaging. 


Which brings me to my question...

1. Could her saying that in a text message and me giving it to the county clerk (before she gets married), make that marriage license void or something?

2. What about giving this to the US immigration? Would they have grounds to kick her out or deny her a green card?

3. What would you do?


I am very scared for her. She isn't the same person she used to be. His manipulation was extreme. She wasn't ""allowed"" to do so many things. When i talk to her friends they too are scared for her and do not trust this guy. There was so much that i didn't see. I guess i took it for granted when she was talking to this kid. She has talked to him for over a year but it was only about 3 months before she left that we noticed changes. We were thinking it was just being a teenager. We were so wrong. Our home is good. We have another daughter that is a few years younger. We have always been a close and what i thought, a good strong family.

We many-a-times get into a discussion about parenting the teenage boys and the situations are different from all of my friends and their sons.     

Teenage is the time when these boys are learning to be men. To put it another way, this is a major step in life because of the [changes in personality, emotions, and physical appearance](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/understanding-puberty.html). These are the years that really matter – to the boys and to the parents as well. Though your sons act and feel like they need you lesser and lesser, in actuality, they need you more than ever. There is plenty of research that shows that parents need to spend more time with their kids when they are in their teenage years. However, you can ask me how is that even possible when they are restricting your presence in their lives.

First of all, you need to find something that your son enjoys doing, and second, do it with him: Bowling, Movie Marathon, Go Camping, Play video games he likes, throw balls around. You have to make sure that you are with your son, spending quality time and not constantly scolding him for doing certain things and not doing others. 

## Teenage Years are Important Parenting Years

You can make the most of these years by connecting with your teenagers. Moreover, this is the time when you can positively affect their ‘[teen behavior](https://www.georgetownbehavioral.com/blog/7-differences-between-normal-abnormal-teenage-behavior)’. They are not going to be in their teens for much longer. So for that reason, use this time to raise them to be the men that you want them to be as an adult. They would learn from you how to behave in ‘their’ ‘real-life’. In fact, you will forever cherish the moments you spend with them during their teens.

## Parenting Teenage Boys Means: 

### 1. You have to Listen

Your teenage son starts to explain his perspective and you immediately find the problems with his reasoning. As part of your parenting, you have an overwhelming temptation to give advice—even though you know that the conversation will end in frustration and disappointment. You have to ignore the impulse to tell them what to do and just listen to them. Your job from now on is to shut up and listen. Michelle Lehnardt from Today.com says – when you take the time to listen, truly listen, your kids will ask your opinion and NOW you offer your wisdom. 

### 2. Your parenting has to teach’em – IT’S NOT ALL ABOUT THEM!

It is about me, my plans, my thoughts! – That’s a teenage boy’s world. 

Fitting in – is now not only important – it is everything to them. This transition is also often filled with rebellious behavior and differing opinions, which can be frustrating for you. 

They begin to expect and even demand more than your love. They desire instant gratification and have the demand to receive something just because they want it. You often fulfill their demands and give your kids more, thinking it will make them feel better, but it actually places a higher value on things than on relationships. 

We all need to grow up and realize. We are the ones with the ability to make sense of all of the madness and chaos that they are producing. Teach them that ‘they’ are not the center of the universe. This lesson is hard but important.

### 3. Delay Their Gratification

Let’s be honest: Teenagers sometimes suck at being patient. Parenting them is teaching them to be patient. For starters, help your child work toward his goal with a step by step plan. If your teenager is working on a big project with the promise of a nice dinner at a restaurant, help him map out a plan to get to the finish line. You could develop a calendar for your child to review or establish goals that are written down and can be reviewed. Offer encouragement as your teen progresses through the project and motivate as he gets closer and closer to the goal. 

Be sure that you carry through on any promise that you make to him. If you promised your child that you would go to the movies after he or she brings up a math grade, be sure you make good on your promise once your child has accomplished the goal. 

In the end, your child will eventually learn that the choices we all make come with consequences. Delaying gratification can help your teen set his or her sites on bigger goals, and work towards achieving them.

 

### 4. Parenting Teenagers also means Getting Down and Dirty

You will embarrass them. You yourself will feel embarrassed. Even if they try and cut the topic, you do not have to. You have to keep working hard and continue to keep the [lines of communication open](https://parentinghighschoolers.com/communicating-with-teenagers/) about the ‘irregular talks’. Talk to them about drugs, alcohol, tobacco, STD’s, and sex. Talk about pregnancy and child support and what are the consequences of premature and unprotected sex. 

The fact is that there is very little discussion on these topics in the family amongst teenagers and parents, though there are reports that teens are getting exposed to all these ‘stuff’ at younger and younger ages.  

### 5.  Teach Empathy through your Parenting

Often, people bully or unintentionally hurt others because they lack the ability to think about and understand the impact of their actions and words on others. Without empathy and respect for others, it’s easy to act in ways that hurt other people. There are many ways your teenager can get what they need without having a negative impact on others, and your parenting needs to teach them these skills. 

They do not have to experience any pain to understand this. Rather, they have to just acknowledge it and let others know that they are there for them.

“Discuss current events with your children and ask them how they think the people in the story might be feeling. It can also help to discuss situations that your teenager might see on TV shows with fictional characters. Ask them if they relate to a particular person in the show and why. Then, ask them what other characters might be thinking and feeling.

Modeling is very important. For example, tell them a story about a time when you might have suspected a friend was in trouble, what you were thinking about at the time, and what you did to help.

### 6. They Can’t Force Someone to Like Them

We know and they too have to know that Rejection is a part of life. Not everyone will like them. You tell your teen that to you, he is wonderful and unique and special. No matter how hard they try, there will still be people who will not like them. They can’t change it. Your parenting needs to teach them that they can’t do anything about it, except to [be kind and move on](https://raisingteenstoday.com/ways-to-help-your-teen-believe-in-themselves/).

This is a life fact that has to be learnt as early as possibly by your teenage kids. 

### 7. Don’t Expect Instant Compliance

This is a very simple thing but subconsciously you might be forcing it on your teenagers. You want them to fold clothes, keep things in place, set utensils on the dinner table, etc. Never expect your kids to stop what they are doing and instantly do the [activities that you ask them to do](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/25-of-the-best-household-chores-for-kids-of-every-age-53410). Respect the fact that they might need a minute to finish what they are doing before they can move onto your tasks. Just tell them not to ignore you and respond by acknowledging that they need 5 minutes to do it.  

Just like we would not be expected to jump up as soon as our spouse or child called us, they should be given enough respect to finish what they are doing before moving onto your task.

### 8.  Important Lesson in Parenting Teenagers – NO MEANS NO.

Have you fallen into the habit of over-explaining and over-negotiating with your kids? With teenage boys in the house, the answer would certainly be a ‘yes’. 

If so, it’s likely that every time your teenager wants to challenge your authority, decision, or rule, you keep talking to him in order to get him to understand why you’ve made the rule in the first place. And often, you find yourself compromising and changing the rules. Understand that what you’re really doing is training your child not to accept your decisions.  

The situations are really complex when you have to listen to their opinions and at the same time teach them to understand consent. But, that’s teenage parenting!

I believe the best thing you can do when your child is arguing with your rules or consequence is to say:

“No, I’m not going to discuss this any further.”

And turn around and walk away. Don’t respond to any backtalk. So if you say no and your child starts saying, “But, but, but…” just keep walking. 

When things are cool, show them another aspect of this by telling them “When someone tells you no (your boyfriend or girlfriend), they mean they do not want whatever it is you are offering. Teach them to think before they react. 

Along with that, also teach him that he too has the [power to say NO](https://worldofmother.com/keep-your-child-safe-from-sexual-abuse/), and the right to follow his instinct when he feels like it is not the right decision.

### 9. Parenting to make them responsible 

Teach them to take responsibility for the wins and for the losses – Not to blame someone else. Role modeling is the most effective tool to teach this and anything else for that matter. Any value you want your teen to have, simply demonstrate it in your everyday life. So if you want your teens to take responsibility for their actions, you should do the same. 

Avoid blaming others. Follow rules, and don’t avoid the consequences if you break them. If you make a mistake, admit it, apologize, and make amends if possible. For example, if you accidentally bang the door of the car next to you in the parking lot, then leave a note!

Let them know and understand – “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.” \~ Charles R. Swindoll. 

### 10. Parenting actively and appropriately

Don’t invite rebellion by refusing to acknowledge that your son is growing up and [needs more freedom](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-to-allow-teen-independence-and-still-keep-them-close-4165998). But don’t be afraid to ask where your kids are going, who they’ll be with, and what they’ll be doing. Get to know your kids’ friends and their parents, so you’re familiar with their activities.",0,"Things No One Tells You About Parenting a Teenage Boy    I have been consulting a few of the school teenagers lately as a part of an assignment and I can say that the [teenage years](https://community.today.com/parentingteam/post/6-obvious-reasons-why-being-a-teenager-is-hard-today) are challenging, wonderful, and scary at the same time.

My sister is shutting down more and more and I don't know what to do.,"Hi everyone, not an actual parent here but a sibling.
My (F18) sister (F14) is straining away from us, she has become increasingly depressed and I don't know what to do. 

Now I understand why she wouldn't want to talk to my dad as it would do more harm then good (borderline abusive, lots of yelling and emotional abuse, he's not a ~bad guy~, just not fit to be a parent). He'd just start yelling at her if she opened up to him and make her feel worse.
My mom is better but my sister doesn't want to open up to her either, I felt the same when I was her age, my mom really tries to understand though, I just personnaly feel like she wouldn't really get it if we opened up to her. 
But now she won't even talk to us her siblings which really came off as a shock to me.
We did talk about 2 weeks ago, she confided in me she was depressed and was feeling worthless and that she was considering to end her life. I also found out she cut her wrists and saw she was looking for ways to kill herself with paracetamol.
She feels lots of pressure from school, she feels so overwhelmed and exceeded, she tells me she's lost and doesn't understand anything, her teachers make her feel worthless and never show any appreciation towards her (which doesn't surprise me, we went to the same school and I was handed the same treatement).
She also came out to me as non binary, which must be so hard to navigate right now as her body is changing, she hates that her boobs are growing and just wants to present as a boy. The pressure of hiding it from our parents, and facing remarks from other children at school must be unbearable. I think she only told me because I am a lesbian myself but haven't come out to our parents either.
She told me all this and she was crying and could barely speak and my heart was so broke I just want to know how I can help her.

This week she's been locking herself in her room mainly because she doesn't like being bothered during online classes, but she won't even come out when she's done at 4pm and only comes out for dinner at 7.30pm, she runs back to her rooms as soon as that's over. She didn't even come out during the weekend.
I tried to spend some time with her today after dinner but she was acting super cold and she didn't want to let me in, I asked ""don't you like when we just hang out and talk"" and she just said ""no"", so I said ""okay"" and left.
I just feel super lost, she used to open up to me before, and we would spend time together but now she won't even look at me. I think I am the most suited to understand what she goes through, as I was teen just yersterday, heck I am still a teen. I just want to know how I can help her.

Sorry for the long text, there was just so much to unpack, I am also not a native speaker so I apologise in advance for any mistakes regarding language.",0,"My sister is shutting down more and more and I don't know what to do.
