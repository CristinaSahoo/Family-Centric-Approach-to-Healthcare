Their dad and i had talks about this way before either was born and the result was essentially, ""doesn't matter; love kids.""

He just came to my room basically asking for fashion advice i am in no way qualified to give. I wear jeans and a shirt that will cover my belly 99% of the time.

Son two, on the way home from the dentist this week, said he's transgender. He shoved into my hand, while i was driving, some referrals to LGBTQ specializing therapists.

I'm so lost. I, of course, love them completely. I have no interest in anything that might ""explain"" or ""apologize for"" who they are. They are my kids. They are wonderful, kind, compassionate people. There is nothing to explain. The end. 

They are, no doubt, better than me.

But i am no fashionista that can help the one child find his soul. I am no trans advocate that can help the other find HIS soul.

I'm a pretty normal, straight, cis-gendered 40+ year old that does not know what to say or do or the best steps to take for either child. I'm alone. My family will not accept. Their dad's family is questionable.

48 hours ago,my wife's cousin have come to my IL's house,his clothes completely ripped,looks like he escaped from a zombie apocalypse and he was generally in bruises.We immediately brought him to the hospital we worked and at there we learned the all story.

He is gay and he is in a traditional Catholic family.My extended IL family is generally really abusive and they beat him out when they discovered porn material in his phone and he ran out,only with his phone and his ID card,in his pyjamas .He found a car to bring him to the city(they live in a rural village that is 3 hours away from where we live) and came to my IL's house. We immediately filed claims about them and with the letters they are sending to me and my wife(a long story),it is not going to last long but he is physically safe for now and also his dad and older brothers are currently arrested (they even did not deny what they did and his mom brought all his stuff to my ILs home really quick after saying that he is a pédale and his other brothers are real men.(which is kinda syn with saying f*g but worse)

I am going through a hard time(some shit in my family either) but if my wife's parents can not adopt him(which is a possibility because they are old),we will and both of us do not have any idea other than he needs mental health care heavily so we hooked him up with a therapist and also to an adolescent clinic.Other than,we do not have an idea at all (we were both child free but this is going to change as we see).

But I wouldn't be here if I didn't need advice and if I weren't serious.

So, for context and a bit of background, normally I wouldn't post about this sort of thing on reddit, since I'm not a avid internet user (I am a doctor in a small rural town, probably the only General Practitioner). This account belongs to my younger half brother who is 22 and I'm 50. (Long stor). We live together and I occasionally share the account just so I can browse on reddit. (Or lurk as the kids call it.)  So just to clarify for those of you who like to peak into account histories and what have you. 

Anyways onto the main event: My son, who for privacy we'll call Ryan, is 14, he has Aspergers or HFA. But he's a good kid, very sociable, and friendly. But yesterday evening when we were having dinner he came to me and said his best friend who is a girl who we'll just call Courtney for her own privacy, decided to share her true feelings about him and essentially gave him his first kiss according to him. Now my son, he doesn't mind the things that come with HFA, like a dislike of loud noises or being touched (He plays football at his High School for God's sakes) he said Courtney asked him if he would go out with her. He didn't quite know how to respond given the situation and the fact he's never dated before

I myself have Aspergers, so I can kind of understand why he'd feel confused about this whole situation, I was diagnosed when  I was in my mid 40s, but I could understand where he was coming from so I could help him, but this? I can't really explain. I also have another son whose 11. My other son attests that he was there when it went down and Courtney asked Ryan if he'd go out with her. Ryan said that he'd think on it. Now I don't know what else happened after that, I only know this was when they were leaving the park nearby when my brother took them hiking in the nearby mountains yesterday. (We live in the Pacific Northwest, USA)

He and Courtney have known each other since they were both around five, and like I mentioned, have been best friends since then. Now Ryan's mother (My wife) passed away back in 2012 due to bone cancer and he hasn't quite been the same since, he actually was very affected by it, but that's a story I'd rather not get too much into. To put it simply, he asked me what he should do, he talked about the fact that apparently he's had such feelings towards her as well but he never actually considered her in that capacity.  But today and later that evening he seemed to actually be happier but confused.

So to put it bluntly, what advice should I give him? How should I explain it? We already had the ""talk"" too, but this took me by surprise since I thought they were just simply friends.

My sister and I are sort of like mom figures to him, and he’s been living with us for a bit since he can’t go back to school due to COVID. My mom basically treats him like a little child and does everything for him (cook, clean, washes his clothes, etc etc). My brother doesn’t have any friends growing up, and still doesn’t today. He spends a lot of time alone because he says “people are the sources of all trouble.” AND AT 18 y/o, he still has COOTIES!!!

(You get the idea).

He doesn’t really know how to express himself. You take him to the doctor and he has trouble explaining his symptoms. He’s definitely a little socially awkward, and he he shuts down and doesn’t talk to you when he’s upset about something.

Ever since the pandemic started, he just likes to sit in his room. He doesn’t like to talk about his future, college, and has no motivation to think about what he wants to do in the future. He seems to just want to be a little kid forever, with someone there to take care of him.

Part of my conversation with my daughter last night (you can see my previews post for context) was that her sister becomes so angry so easily and constantly, and one resentment she have with my 15 years old is that sometimes ""she doesn't want to be with her"".

My oldest one likes to be heard when she ask for attention (but she could ignore you when you wants her attention). So my teenager said that her online school, homework, projects (plus her love for music) absorb her days, her thoughts, so sometimes she just doesn't wants anyone around, she also said ""you know that even I don't want you around either"" (keep in mind that we are close), it was funny so I just say OF COURSE I KNOW!.

Well, if you followed my previews post, last night was good but today she is stressed, her mind is in ""her problems"" which is fine.

I got a call from my 14yo daughter’s school wellness counselor yesterday while I was at work. She is suicidal, and I had no idea. She had asked to start seeing a therapist again because she was having anxiety and we’d been working on getting the appointments, but there were a lot of delays and her first solo appointment was just rescheduled to a later date that morning. She was meeting with the school counselor and an intern in the meantime. The head counselor called me while her meeting with the intern was happening, and they kept my daughter on the Zoom call to make sure she was safe until I could get to her. I dropped what I was doing and we went straight to the emergency room. They put her on a 5150 hold. Both the counselor and the psychiatrist she saw at the ER said it seemed primarily due to emotional abuse at the hands of her father. I know what he’s like, but the judge wasn’t convinced at our hearing and he still gets to see her most weekends and holidays and has equal legal custody. I’m so, so grateful that she had someone to talk to so we could get her help, because I DIDN’T SEE IT. Even after I knew, I came home to get her to take her to the hospital and she seemed like her normal self. We were in the ER for almost 12 hours waiting for a transport to a pediatric facility and she seemed like her normal self. She has been feeling this way for over a year, and she has seemed like her normal self. I am terrified.

I guess I’m asking for advice.  

Me and my daughter have always had a very close bond but lately it’s been rocky because of who she is seeing. My daughter is 16 and dating a 21 year old man. Just typing that grosses me out. 

About a month ago, she came to me to explain she was seeing him. She met him at a local job fair (that I now regret taking her to). 

Really the only thing that bothers me is his age. He has a job, goes to college, seems pretty nice but it gives me the creeps that he’s attracted to my child. I refuse to leave them alone in a room cause I’m worried he really only wants her for one thing. 

All we do is argue all day and night about this guy. I want to trust that she’s not going to just throw herself to this guy but it’s so damn hard. I wanna file a restraining order but that would ruin our relationship.

I worry about everything from boys to school, to making sure social media and things alike don’t cause mental strain.

I wonder if she might be growing up too fast? I compare things to what I was doing at her age (and I’m not old)

My ultimate goal has always been to make sure she is happy and equipped with the knowledge to make safe and healthy decisions.

But I still stress. Am I teaching her the right things? Will she actually take my advice? Does she think I’m overbearing? Will she be easily influenced? Will she come to me with important things?

She tells me things and I trust her but I STILL STRESS! I’m outspoken so I’m always gonna say what’s on my mind or what I think about things and I also worry I might scare her off?

Parenting is tough and scary. And I only make it harder because my brain doesn’t stop.

My parents desperately want him to stay in the US for college to be close to family but also they don't understand where this negative attitude came from, especially during a pandemic, he doesn't really understand what life can be like in the US. Every night ends up in a screaming match with my mom's argument is we moved here for you/you can't just move countries when you want/you need to adapt/our family is here now etc.  He is 100% determined to go to school in the UK which breaks my parents heart as they have sacrificed a lot to bring us to the US...

He has been going through some rough times in his life right now especially when it comes to dealing with my parents. My parents have expressed to me the same about him. I just moved out about 6 months ago in a fit of rage with my parent when they decided to take away my personal property as a punishment for my siblings. These items were various game systems and my personal computer that I all payed for with my own money. My parents are firm believers that using these technologies for anything aside from education is detrimental to our well being and mental state. 

Ever since I moved out from my parents house my parents have gotten rid of everything that my younger sibling finds entertaining because they felt after that I moved out, it caused my brother to lose respect for them. This is most likely true considering how he has been acting since. He knows full and well his responsibilities around the house and pertaining to school, however, whenever my parents ask him to do something, it is usually followed with a threat of taking something away which in turn causes him to specifically rebel and do the exact opposite of what he has been told.

The only person that can get him to hold him self accountable for his actions is me, and I can tell my parents despise that I still have his respect and they don't. This in turn causes them to punish him more for being disrespectful, and there have been a few times where it has gotten to the point where my mom will physically move him down to his room and ensure that he does not come out until he has learned his lesson. My younger brother has just learned to accept this and will no longer do anything willingly for my parents and my parents just push back in the same way and the situation isn't improving for either one of them. 

I have heard my Dad wants to give him up to foster care and that if this continues with no improvement he will carry out this. He does the things my parents expect when I ask him to do them because he knows I am sympathetic with his situation and understands his responsibility to keep his grades up and such because I had trouble with it when I was younger too. But I cannot be there all the time to hold him accountable and I want to teach him to be that way as well, but whenever my parents intervene, usually with some form of punishment, he ends up right back where he started.

Like many households, my wife and I made the decision to allow our children to have smart phones.  Again like many households, it started innocently enough with our first child in middle school with lots of oversight, rules and monitoring.  However, as time moved on and the perception of responsibility and maturity took over, we paid less and less attention to our oldest as our younger 2 boys required more time.

Enter snapchat.  We really had no clue just how devious this app was.  I understood the basics behind it.  Chat, send pics and vids, and everything is deleted.   I wasnt super worried about the social aspects of this for my kid as he is smart, does good in school, has lots of extracurriculars, and all in all is pretty well rounded.  To be honest, I was no angel at 16 and I do realize that kids grow up...16 years old and this is how the teenagers communicate, whats the worse that can happen...Boobs and d1ck pics?    My wife and I have always tried to be open, honest, and informative when it comes to discussing sexual relationships but in the end it is up to them to make and be accountable for their decisions.  All that being said...there was 1 thing I overlooked....the DRUGS!!!  

I had no idea...and not to spoil the ending here...but I think we caught this in time.   Anyway....if you arent aware, here is how it works.....There are literally drug dealers on snapchat...and lots of them.  One small aspect of snap chat are snap maps.  it makes it real easy to see where any of your friends are.  you simply go to the map and it shows you were everyone is.  Another aspect is your snap chat story...its just like facebook or instagram feed where you just post stuff and everyone that you want to see it will see it.   

Taking these things into consideration, these guys/girls constantly update their stories with a mixture of cars, bling, cash, guns, girls and then all the drugs that they currently have with them and how much it all costs.  as a kid, all you have to do is snap a dealer ""soccer practice ends in 10 mins, this is where I am, my moms gonna be 20 mins late, Ill take zannies, lean, cookies and cream and some shatter"" its that easy and your kid just bought xanax, codeine, marijuana and another form of smokable THC.  They can get vape, dabs, pills, pot, guns, whatever anyone is selling.  Doesnt matter where you live, how nice it is or how many gates there are.  There are people in your community selling drugs and they can and will get to your kids on snapchat.  Any moment your child is not within your sites, they can be buying drugs...its that easy.  You can go 500 miles away on vacation and your child can link up with a drug dealer before the plane lands or you park the car.  Thats just the reality of whats going on

&amp;#x200B;

Im my kids case, on his phone he was following like 15 of these guys.  Did he buy and use...yup!  Did I catch him..yup!  Is he now drug tested minimum once a week...yup!  I digress a bit from this to bring up mspy

&amp;#x200B;

i tried mspy for like 2 hours and realized it ain't the answer.  there is nothing out there that can monitor snapchat...i mean nothing.   even rooting an iPhone and adding mspy doesn't work...or work well....and on a side note, mspy...once they get your money, good luck getting a refund, they will do anything other than give you your money back.  As I said, I bought it, tried it for less than 24 hours and then realized it wasn't the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Im going to end this WOT with a request for any diligent parents to post their monitoring solutions.  Also, I appreciate all comments but if you're gonna tell me to not allow snapchat, dont bother...its the only way the kids are communicating unfortunately.  removing it puts them on a socially void island....believe me, I watched it for 2 months while he was grounded from his phone and its hard to witness them being cut out of their social group",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2819987,public,self,"Dangers of snapchat, mspy is HORRIBLE (read inside), any suggestions on monitoring",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/j870qy/dangers_of_snapchat_mspy_is_horrible_read_inside/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

My daughter is 13 years old, she is a shy and timid soul. The type that hides behind her long hair and actively avoids any situation she isn't comfortable with (we're working on that).

On Wednesday (7th Oct) she was walking back home after getting off the school bus and a woman drove up to her in her car and stopped my daughter and accused her of bullying a boy (also from my daughters school). My daughter denied this and eventually ignored the lady and walked away.

It transpires that a group of school children were throwing berries at each other. The group consisted of a friend of my daughters, the friends brother, brothers friend and another boy (lets call him 'J'). My daughter was not throwing berries as has been confirmed by my daughter and 3 of the other four pupils.

The woman who stopped my daughter witnessed the berry throwing and interpreted it as J being bullied. She has apparently pulled over to talk to J who has told this lady he was being bullied and that my daughter and my daughters friend were attempting to force him into eating the berries and were punching him. J is well known at the school for embellishing the truth and has been in trouble multiple times for punching other students.

I find it quite disturbing that this lady has then actively sought out a 13 year old child (from where she spoke to J to where she stopped my daughter is about 1/4 mile) to then berate her in the street. Furthermore she has then posted to a community Facebook group about the incident, giving details of what school my daughter goes to, what bus stop she gets off at and what year at school she is in (this is the UK btw). This post has over 100 comments from what can only be described as a Facebook mob (and of course plaudits for her). The comments consist of people calling for those involved to be exposed, to be expelled and encouraging people to phone the school to express their anger.

The later of the above has been happening and random people have been contacting the school demanding justice. 

My daughter is now scared to get the bus home for fear of these Facebook vigilantes. I am beyond angry about this - I have logged the incident with the Police as no adult should be stopping a CHILD in the street to intimidate them and to then further it by doing the Facebook post. The Police told me this is common and the people that post such things on Facebook don't actually care about any of what they're posting about, they're just looking for attention for themselves. 

I also feel that this woman is now in fact the bully, by intimidating my daughter and causing potential issues at the school.

I had written a long message to her calling her out on what she's done, but then I thought better of it as she'll likely ignore anything I say and just use it to make another Facebook post.

The woman in question did ring the school to report what J told her, which is fine, and is all the action she needed to have taken. But she has overstepped the mark with her additional actions, of which the Police agree with me on. The Police have said they will be speaking to her about stopping children in the street, I have also reported her post to Facebook, not that I expect them to do anything about it.

Apart from that there isn't any other recourse, I'm so very angry, if this gets around school and my daughters name comes up it may well cause issues at the school for her with other pupils (of course not something this woman would have stopped to think about).

He has two children from a previous marriage, let’s say, Alice (16F) and Larry (11M).  For the most part the relationships are all amicable, including between myself and his ex wife, Sara (42F). I am now pregnant with my first. The kids live with their mother most of the time but spend a night or two with us every weekend.  Nick drives them to sports, outings, etc whenever he can but he works 12-830pm M-F. 

Alice began applying for her first real job. She was applying at a mall that is a fair distance away, and so while she was applying I was asking my spouse, how will she get to/ from work ? In my opinion, a major part of having a job, for a young person, is to develop independence and life skills. This was never really addressed/ discussed further.  So now she has landed a retail job at that mall and I again asked, how will she get there and home ? The first thing I did was check out the bus routes and she can bus, will take about 45 mins and 2 busses, but I don’t think this is a very good solution when she’s leaving at 9-10pm at night. Our city isn’t the safest city (although that area is pretty safe). 

A couple days ago I get a text message from Alice asking me to take her to work on Thursday (today).  I was frustrated because 1) like I said, I think that a job is not just about the financial independence but also to develop independence and life skills and 2) I don’t want to be driving her every Thursday to work, I work full time myself, am 6 months pregnant, we’re moving next week and so I’m managing finding a subletter for our apartment and packing, I’m taking an Accounting course and I walk dogs in my spare time, I just don’t have it in me to add another thing on, especially when I don’t agree with the principal of it. 

Nick (and I presume Sara) and I disagree about this as Nick says he was driven around a lot by his parents, I responded that ‘you don’t know how to take a bus..’ I thought the point of parenting a teenager is to teach them to become independent adults who can manage on their own.  My parents didn’t drive me around every where, I walked to my first job until I could drive myself. I moved out when I was 18 and again I walked/ drove to work. 

To be clear, I’m not against EVER driving her to work, if it’s convenient, if the parents have nothing going on, sure.  But I don’t think it should be relied upon. I don’t think she should have even applied to jobs she can’t get to on her own, say, with more than 1 bus required, or within walking distance.

The child that was being bullied is from a very poor family. I am trying to figure out a way to go about this that opens my child's eyes to the real world outside of privilege.


I am a veterinarian, my children ( triplets M14) and I escaped from extreme abuse a while back and we are all in therapy. My children know how bad abuse can get. However my children have never been hungry. They have never had to do without or worry about if the bills would be paid. They have always had nice clothing and never had to deal with hand me downs. They have never struggled. 


I grew up as the youngest of 13 children born to Mexican Immigrants. We were very poor. I lost both of my parents before I turned 13 and afterward had to leave everything we had and lived on a street that was smack in the middle of two rival gangs. There was a bullet hole in my bedroom wall I could see out of. We had to choose between food and power quite often. I fought my way to the top of my field and was damned and determined my children would never hurt for anything but now I am worried that I may have done something wrong in that regard. 


My son knows very well that I fought my way to our current life so it angers me that he would treat someone who is currently living a life I lived for a very long time as less than human. I do not know if this is something that is stemming from all of the crap his father did that we are currently in therapy for or if he is just being an ass because he has more expensive things. My fiance thinks it has more to do with him being a teenager and just finding something to pick on someone for ( they adore my fiance so we know he isn't  acting out over me getting remarried).

We got some good people"" said the gang leader, and my son replied with ""Yeah, I need to get into one"", to which the gang leader said ""Alright, if you want to join my crew, I'm gonna fight ya to see if you can join. I'm an Isabelle, but I have someone who you can fight too. They're a Robin"", to which my son replied, ""Yeah, of course, is next Friday good?"" and the gang leader replied, ""Maybe, we're doing a crew battle with another crew that we had some beef with so depending on how good you are, we could use ya"". and my son replied, ""Yeah, don't worry I got you"". The gang leader replied, ""Alright I'm gonna head to work now, let's see if you're good enough for this crew""  


 At this point I was like, wait he's getting in a gang fight with people named robin and Isabelle? What the hell is he doing? I know some terms like ""beef"" mean they're into an argument and if he's getting into gang fights I just need to talk to him but I honestly don't know what to say.

I’d like some parenting suggestions as we’d like to go about this in the most healthy way as possible, but we’re all pretty shaken up about this. My little brother 2 years ago when he was 11 stole $200 in cash from my older brother to buy skins for fortnite. He got in trouble and things passed.   

Recently my boyfriend left his xbox at my parents and let him borrow it, my boyfriend found fraud on his bank for a purchase.  He let my little brother know he is not allowed to purchase anything and to not do it again.  This past week he gets another notification for a $200 charge going through on the Xbox. 

That same day our dad found another $100 purchase for a game.  Safe to say he’s grounded and has no access to any games anymore.  THEN, we find out he charged $300 to a credit card that we cannot find right now, someone else’s credit card that is no ones in our family.

THIS MORNING, we find out he found his tablet and bought $400 worth of games..... after he’s already in trouble for lying and stealing the money mentioned above. 

$1k+ in purchasing for gaming and lying about it still. 

He has fessed up to some of these and is making up lies and saying he doesn’t know where the other purchases came from even though it literally says his name as the purchase. 

It’s good to note that he’s been emotionally distant from the family for a while so we’re trying to find out what’s going on there. We have an enormous family and he’s the baby, but we’re all extremely happy and love each other.

I've been parenting as a divorced mom for 12 years. From age 5-9, my ex husband was involved in his parenting, less and less as time went on. And one day when my son was 9, he just didn't show up to get my son on his weekend--complete abandonment with no warning or explanation. He later voluntarily terminated his parental rights so he wouldn't have to pay the $18k in back child support he owed. So it's just been me and my son for the past 8+ years--no alimony, no child support.

When my son was young, he was a model child--sweet &amp; kind, smart, funny, social, great grades, etc. No parent could have asked for a better child. We were very close and loving with each other.  But since my son turned 12, it's been a different story. I know some of this is just typical teen stuff for sure, but some of it isn't and it can be extreme at times.

My ex husband is a psychopath. Very briefly, he and his new GF (who I caught him cheating with) made my life a living hell for YEARS. He dragged me back to court over and over for no reason--just to screw with me, my state of mind, my finances, and my professional reputation. I didn't do anything to bring this on and tried to be as amicable as possible, but it was a game to him. He was making $130k at the time we split and I had just restarted my career after 5 years as a SAHM, so our finances were in no way equal. He devastated me financially and emotionally because I had to hire a lawyer to defend myself and keep my custody rights. He lost every single court battle and kept switching attorneys, leaving a trail of debt behind him.  In the end, I prevailed but it cost me $20k that I didn't have in order to do so.

Just a small list of what my ex husband did to me: slashed my tires in a church parking lot while my son and I were in a cubscout meeting, threw a gallon of blood red paint on my garage door, brought multiple frivolous legal actions (I ""lived"" at the court house), stalked me in a rental car, sent me over 3000 abusive text messages (at a time when phones couldn't block callers), came to my house with a handgun and wouldn't leave until he was arrested, kidnapped my son from grade school on a day that wasn't his without notifying me (he was arrested for that), then in retaliation he had me arrested on false charges of communicating threats to his GF, libeled me to my colleagues about it, and left copies of ""The Blotter"" rag containing my mugshot in all my neighbors' paper boxes, etc etc etc. Imagine the WORST divorce you can and multiply it by 10 and that's what it was.

I hid nearly all of this from my son to the very best of my ability. He may have known there were a few strange things going on, but he didn't know it that his father was doing it. And I've never told him, or badmouthed his father in any way, because my lawyer told me to take the high road and it was the right thing to do. My son and I just don't talk about his father or even mention him except in passing very occasionally.

My son is extremely intelligent--IQ over 140, has always tested well and straight A grades come easily to him. He thinks he's smarter than everyone (including me) and he probably is, but he lacks wisdom (as all teens do). He started smoking weed when he was 14 and not too long after, psychedelics. He's honest with me about those things and I haven't come down too hard on him about it because I knew he'd just do it behind my back if I forbid it and the cat was already out of the bag and wasn't going back in. To my knowledge, he's never done any other drugs. And he's maintained his grades (all honors and AP classes--ranks near top of his class).  He's also popular--lots of friends (but it seems like most of them are losers) and he's had his share of GFs too.

Our house has always been the designated sleepover house. On any given weekend, there are 3-6 teen boys here. I've always been kind and friendly to his friends. We live in the same house we've lived in since my son was 4 years old, even though it's been very hard financially at times for me to keep up with it, and that's especially true since covid. The bills always get paid, he always has healthy home-cooked meals, he always has clean clothes to wear, I've always been involved with his school and gone to his school functions, etc. In other words, I'm a great mom.

But here's the problem. My son is an asshole. I feel used. I feel like nothing but a free vending machine to him. He's rude and contemptuous for no reason. I'm not a lazy or stupid or mean person--I'm kind and loving, smart, and hardworking. He has absolutely no appreciation for me or the things I do for him. I don't coddle him--he has chores and a job, and pays for his own gas money etc. But he did destroy my car by not putting any oil in it and I had to buy another (used) one--he paid me for about half of it but then he got in a fender bender and the car needed repairs so now he's back to owning none of it because I had to pay for that since he didn't have the money.  I have another old car that I drive.

I will admit that I have a tendency to forgive quickly and want things to go back to normal.  I sometimes allow him to get out of grounding early in exchange for extra chores.  I don't like being a hardass mom, and compared to some other parents I am a hardass, but I feel that maybe I'm a bit too soft at times.  My natural state is to be kind and loving, and it's very difficult for me to maintain being hard for very long.

I feel that some of this is my fault in that I had a live-in BF for awhile who was mildly emotionally abusive--moody and just mean at times.  He did not act as a stepfather to my son--they had very few interactions and just ignored/tolerated each other.  My son may have picked up some of his qualities.

One of my son's best friends (who I had treated like my own son) was extremely rude and disrespectful to me after I had taken him on a trip and paid for it (and it wasn't the first time). My son took his friend's side, and even after I banned this friend from our house (I didn't ban their friendship), he invited him back 3 months later and when I found him here I made him leave (big scene with the friend calling me a ""fucking bitch"" etc).  I suspect the boys had been drinking.  My son has also admitted that he's had alcohol multiple times (just like most teens I guess). This just happened 2 days ago.  My son doesn't understand why I was so upset that he invited his banned friend back.  He gaslighted me--""it was not big deal"" (it was), ""I thought it was water under the bridge"" and ""You're overreacting.""  This is typical for my son--if I'm ever upset for (very legitimate) reasons he always tries to downplay it and make me feel that I'm in the wrong. 

Once when we got into a huge argument, he pinned my hands above my head against the wall and screamed in my face for 5 minutes.  I couldn't move, I told him to let me go and he wouldn't.  I was afraid he might kill me.  He later apologized and swore he'd never do it again (and he hasn't) but I feel he only did that so I wouldn't have him arrested or send him to military school etc.  That's how I always feel--that he's just manipulating me to get whatever he wants and that he has no real love for me.

I tried to get him into counseling after this incident, but once the counselor found out that I knew my son smoked weed, her supervisor told her that she had to end the relationship because I was essentially condoning illegal behavior, and that was a legal risk for them.  I'm not condoning it, but I know I can't stop it so I don't try.  The counselor told me off the record that she understood my perspective and wished she could treat my son, but it was a legal issue so she couldn't.  I have not pursued any other counselor because the legal issues would be the same if we told the truth, and what's the point of counseling if you can't be honest?

I don't THINK my son is a psychopath like his father, but I wonder.  He never seems to have any empathy or understanding for my perspective.  He just uses me to get whatever he wants, and beyond that he doesn't seem to care about me at all.  He hasn't bought me birthday or mother's day or xmas gifts in several years, despite having the money, or if he has it's because I asked him to and told him exactly what I wanted--it wasn't done spontaneously out of love.  Some of this is definitely exacerbated by covid because school is virtual right now--I let him sleep in as late as he can, but when I bring him tea in bed every morning, he usually yells at me for waking him up.

Honestly I'm exhausted from parenting this child.  He just does whatever he feels like doing whenever he feels like doing it, and expects me to provide everything for him with nothing in return.  Yes, I understand that in many ways this is a typical parent/child relationship.  But is it RIGHT?  I'm a human being, not a free vending machine.  If this was ANY other type of relationship, it would absolutely be labeled abusive.  It's very hard for me to live with someone who is so negative towards me for no reason.  I'm constantly on eggshells and my physical and mental/emotional health are taking a toll.  He TAKES everything and gives NOTHING.  It's completely one-sided.  I just want to sell my house and move away.  I'm very tired of being used and abused.  He has 8 months of high school left, and then hopefully he will be in college on a ""full ride"" scholarship, but I'm not sure how much more of this I can take, or SHOULD take.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2798354,public,self,My teen son is abusive and I'm tired of parenting him,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/j53ucb/my_teen_son_is_abusive_and_im_tired_of_parenting/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

He’s introspective so I think there’s something I can say or do that would help him see the mistake of not going to college.  Thanks so much in advance.

My son is 17, 18 next month, and just graduated HS. He’s a smart kid and has done very well academically but does NOT enjoy school. He graduated with an Honors Diploma and some college credits. Up until recently, he wanted to study aerospace engineering and could reasonably expect to get into any college he applies to. (He has not applied to schools yet bc when school went online, we decided he should graduate a year early so we could leave NYC. He missed application deadlines bc he didn’t know he’d be graduating until after they passed.)

He met a girl online and they’ve been in a relationship for 7 months. She lives in another country and bc of the travel bans, he hasn’t been able to meet her in person. She’s a sweet girl and they spend almost every waking hour on FaceTime calls. She is also a bright kid and originally wanted to be a dermatologist. 

He’s planned a life with her and now he no longer wants to go to college, nor does she. He wants to go to a trade school, get married and live in an RV until they save enough money to put down on a house and have tons of babies. I think the RV is a cool idea, tbh. They plan on living a “tradcath” (tradition catholic) lifestyle which, if I understand correctly, he’ll be responsible for the income and she will manage the house and children. (She does plan to work up until they have kids but would not be able to work in the states until she receives a green card which takes over a year.) They’re putting religion high up on the priorities list. Prior to meeting her, he was an atheist. I am an atheist too but fully support him going through this conversion. I’m looking forward to attending his baptism and confirmation in April. 

I have major concerns about *some* of these choices. I’m disappointed he no longer wants to go to college. I’m uncomfortable with her not wanting to go college and wanting instead to be a housewife to someone who’s not able to take care of himself yet. She’s moving to a whole different country and putting faith into someone who is essentially still a fully dependent child. Also, the amount of responsibility he’s taking on at such a young age is a lot for anyone. I’m concerned they’re going to “accidentally” get pregnant before having a house. I’m worried that if she comes over to the US on a K1 visa that he’ll be financially responsible for her for the next 10 years. I’m embarrassed to tell family and friends that he has a girlfriend he’s never met but plans to marry this summer after online dating for 1/2 a year. I’m worried that she’ll be bored/lonely in an RV all day while he’s out working. I’m worried that her parents seem to support her plans when she’s 17 and a senior in HS still?! (This 100% for sure is not about a green card. She lives in a great country and could come over on a student visa with no problems.)

I’ve been trying for the last 4 months to get him into counseling but no one is taking a 17 yro thats about to turn 18. I have an appointment lined up for him once he turns 18 next month.

I’m torn. I know he’s going to do whatever he wants so I don’t want to alienate him but I also don’t want to under-intervene and miss my chance to get him to go to college. We’ve talked extensively about this but his ADHD brain is only seeing the fruit of his labors, not the amount of labor he’s got to put in for his vision to come into fruition. 

*He cannot see any problems coming up that would change their feelings for each other.*

I think she’s a lovely girl and they make each other happy. I’m glad they met and I hope they do live a happily ever after. It would be nice if she came over on a student Visa and they got to know each other in person before committing to marriage. But there wouldn’t be any premarital sex (by her choice, and he supports this) so there’s a sense of urgency to tie the knot. 

Is there anything else I can say or do that might convince him to go to college and slow down their plans? He’s already asked if they can live with me while they go to college and I said no. Which is why they’re going the RV route with him opting for the apprenticeship/trade route. 

I’m honestly thinking about buying a patch of land behind my house and letting them setup shop in their RV there if they go to college. On one hand I feel like any significant help I give will be bc they’ve essentially exploited my desire to ensure he grows into a functioning adult but on the other hand, I know he’s not doing this *to me* but rather wanting to do this for himself.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Like really, really difficult. Tantrums that lasted multiple hours, multiple times a week. 

She's been seeing a therapist for years, and the lady is lovely but my daughter never gets any better. Partly because my daughter doesn't actually divulge her inner truth, much less her actual behavior.  And partly, imo, because the lady is so nice she never presses my daughter to get better. Maybe that's an age appropriate treatment but it's extremely frustrating that the only""progress"" she has had is ""maturity"" (I don't feel there's been much progress and she is still very immature for her age)

Things got better, a bit, when she started on an anti-depressant and much better when she started on an 'anti-impulsive' behavioral rx. But she has decided she doesn't want to take them now. I do understand that prozac can make you feel blah but she has become an absolute jerk/crazy person when she's not on them. 

I don't even know what to do. She's back on the 'anti-impulsive' (aripiprazole) and it's so short acting that it's had an immediate affect. Things are peaceful and we get along. When's she off though? Oh my god. 

Now I'm just waiting for her to stop taking it again, and then everything will fall to shit, again. I don't want to force drugs but she is out of control otherwise (interpersonal relationships too, besides at home behavior).  She's in early teens. Can someone give me some tips?

She has lashed out and called rides to pick her up on school nights when I have told her she simply can not go out due to her grades. She had 3 F's in the middle of last school year. She calls these people's parent's and tells them she is allowed to go and flies out the door (the doorway and our street are about 15 steps away) before I can say a word.

I called the police the first 2 times and they said ""Just let her go"". and ""There is nothing we can do"".

Last night at 10pm, I received an email from her teacher. 12 assignments are missing already after only 1 month of school. She has an F in Algebra.

I refuse to let her go to this sleepover this weekend. She needs to work on all of these assignments. It is my custodial weekend. However, I am worried she will repeat her past behavior of calling a friend and leaving. She has no concern for her future. My ex does not care and says she is a ""perfect angel"" at his house because he allows her to do whatever she wants!

Thoughts? I was wondering if I should make a list for her to see the reasons she can't go this weekend but I know that will blow up on me. I need help.

I feel like such a failure as a parent and I honestly don't know what to do for my 17 year old son.

School has always been hard for him all the way back to kindergarten.  He was a slow learner/developer.  He was put on an IEP to help him in school, which did help through 5th grade.  Then middle school hit and he was bullied.  His mood and attitude changed when that started and we could tell something was wrong, but he would not tell us what.  Finally, towards the end of sixth grade he said that he was being bullied. I contacted the school principal to let her know and she did some investigating and found out that yes indeed he was being bullied and separated the offender from my son putting him into a completely different class so that my son wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. However the bullying continued all the way up through his now senior year in high school he has told us a few times of it happening and each time I have reached out to either the school counselor or the principal to voice my concerns and adjustments were made to his schedule or the offenders schedule. My son continues to struggle with school, he has at numerous times through high school fallen way behind and gotten D's and f's. He usually has C's B's or I should say had, during middle school and up until last year, junior year.  Knowing that he has always struggled our stance with him as always been as long as he tried and did his best, we didn't care about the grades.  

Then COVID hit right as they went on Spring break and would not return to school (still hasn't).  He had a girlfriend at the time, but that relationship turned bad after about a month of not being able to see each other. They started getting into arguments and fights over the stupidest things.  I don't know the full story but I have my suspicions that she was just using him. she would tell him oh yeah let's get together on such and such day or at such and such time and then an hour or two before would cancel saying oh my dad won't let me leave the house or I'm not feeling good. And it happened every single time they made plans to get together and they never actually could end up seeing each other. This left my son very heartbroken and lonely. It got to the point where he was saying things about dying but not saying that he would kill himself or hurt himself. He would say like I wish I wasn't here anymore or I wish I could just fly out into outer space and become a Star wars hero, he loves Star Wars by the way. I got him in to speak to a counselor because he was depressed really. The counselor was of no help.  We saw him 3 times.  Twice in person, then one via video once COVID shut down.  The only thing he wanted him to do was to practice some breathing exercises to help him relax so he can sleep better because if he could sleep better that would help with his depression. I don't know if that's true or not I'm not a therapist so I can't say for sure but that just to me didn't seem the right thing but who knows. After talking to his primary doctor she reluctantly put him on an antidepressant which he's been on for 6 weeks now and is showing signs of improvement but still has some setbacks here and there.

We are at a point in school his senior year he is so far behind on all of his work because he's just not doing the work because of being depressed and not wanting to do have anything to do with school or anything that reminds him of school or his ex-girlfriend.he has f's in every single class because of the amount of work that is missing plus he has what they call credit recovery from classes that he has failed in previous years that he has yet to work on as it stands right now he will not be graduating. And this is where I feel I have failed as a parent,  I don't know what to do,  he has repeatedly asked me, sometimes in tears sometimes not,  but very seriously has asked me if he can just drop out of school because it is just too much and too hard.  I was trying to help him with some work last night to start getting caught up and in frustration he said I give up either I'm going to die or I'm going to quit school but I'm not doing this anymore.  I, as his father, have cried over this to the point where I think I am creating a lot of stress for myself which is affecting my health.

He has no desire to get a driver's license mainly because studying for the driving test is too hard for him he doesn't know how to take notes properly he can't really remember stuff that he has read in the manual. So he hasn't even really gone past chapter one in our states driver handbook. He also has no desire to get a job and I have told him repeatedly he needs to get a job and make money and by doing that getting out of the house which will help him with his depression. But he just refuses wants to just sit at home veg and play video games.  I've tried threatening to ground him take away his Xbox his phone his tablet all of his electronic devices and he doesn't respond he literally the last time I did that unplugged everything and put everything on her bed and said sell it I don't care anymore, then he sinks deeper into depression and I get very worried that he will do something drastic, so I don't push him.  Am I failing as his father by not being stern with him?  Or am I taking the right approach by backing off, since he is depressed and make comments about wanting to die or no longer be here.  He even asked me a couple of weeks ago if we can basically fake his death and tell the world that he no longer is alive and he would then wear Star wars clone army get up went out in public so that nobody would know it was actually him.

He refuses to go see a therapist because of what happened with the first one then I have told him repeatedly that I am not going to let that happen again when we go see his somebody new I will make sure that they are going to take care of his needs and not just try to brush him off with sleeping exercises or meditation yeah I'm sure some of that does work but he needs something different. However he still refuses to go see a therapist.  

Do I just let him quit school and drop out and take a lot of that stress away from him for now and then work on getting him his driver's license so that he can get a job so he can be productive in society and get out of the house or do I push the issue and tell him you're not dropping out you will finish school?  I know there are skill jobs that do not require high school diplomas. I just don't know what to do anymore.

She has a little weekend job that earns her some pocket money but not much.

My husband and I are the legal guardians of my sister. TLDR, our family sucks. Our mom died from substance abuse when my sister was 13. My dad sucks too. He only cares about his wife and his big paychecks. He willingly gave my sister to us because she has mental health issues like self harm and depression and he didn’t want to deal with it. 

I don’t want to ramble but my husband and I have sacrificed so much to provide for my sister. We have bent over backwards endlessly to help her grow, to support her, to get her the mental health help she needs. She was grounded for two weeks for bringing her bf over without permission three times in a week. (Among other behavioral issues.) Two days before she was to be un-grounded we found she’d been using a trap phone to talk to him and see him anyway. We extended the grounding for a week. Then five days after that we found three more trap phones shed hidden in her room. We also got a call from her bf and his mom saying my sister told them she was going to kill her self. Honestly these suicide threats are not unusual for her. She’s threatened this so many times when she’s been grounded for very justifiable reasons like above. But long story short she had to be Baker Acted last night and is in a behavioral health in patient center for a few days. We’ve done so much to help her  (including getting her on antidepressants and getting her a counselor) but she needs even more than we can provide. I just hope so much she’ll actually put in effort to get better but based on her history I don’t think she will. Which sucks tremendously. 

Idk I guess I’m looking for any advice or recommendations for books on parenting troubled teens. It’s hard because I’m not her mom. The relationship isn’t the same and some basic parenting stuff doesn’t apply. I basically got this weird promotion to parent figure, but we are used to being best friends. Idk. I feel like I’ve tried everything for her. But the level of betrayal I feel because of her constant lies and deceit is going to make this all even harder (she lies about literally everything). How can we even move forward let alone figure out how tf to keep parenting her? I can’t give up on her but I’m at the end of my rope.

Her whole life she had been a very affectionate girl, often showering me with loving words and affection completely unprompted even as recently as the end of last year/start of this year. I was a single parent and she is my only child and the bond between us was very strong.

When her periods started it was like a switch had been flicked from child to teenager. It took just weeks for a complete change. She never offers affection anymore and is often reluctant to reciprocate hugs. She spends most free time in her room but to be fair to her during the brief times she comes out she can be good humoured and we can have a laugh. 

I’m sure her behaviour is all normal and nothing to worry about but the thing is I feel like I’m grieving. She’s my only child and I feel like that child has gone now. Of course I love the girl she is now to bits but I sometimes think I’m not just grieving the loss of one child but many - there were so many different versions of her through the years and my heart breaks knowing I’ll never see any of them again. Of course it’s right that she grows up and goes forth into the world - she’s overcome serious health problems in the past and I was worried she might not make it and so her growing up as she should is wonderful. But I still miss all those other girls.

I just wondered if there is something wrong with me for feeling like this. And if there was a way I could stop.

I was a young mother. Both my Boys were planned pregnancy. I have autoimmune issues and was told if I wanted Bio Children that I must start young. My oldest was born 3 days before my 20 Bday. My youngest was born 2 years latter with in months of His birth I developed inoperable cysts on my ovaries and my health declined So I was unable to have the third Child I dreamed of. I have always tried to be positive about my health and Infertility issues I realize I am blessed to have 2 perfect kids but the older they get the more the ache of Baby hunger or fever comes back. I feel like I am missing some one very important in my life like there's a blank spot. Where some unknown Child belongs to are family. I've thought about adoption or surrogacy. The dilemma comes in when I take into account my Partners age he will be 50 this year to my 38. Alzheimer's runs in his family Nearly every One of his mother's siblings have been effected by the age of 75. We had genetic testing done and was told yes he carries the gean but there is only a 50 percent chance he will get it. The other Issue is I swore I wouldn't raise my kids as only Children I am an only child and I hated it I feel like I missed alot not having that sibling bond. I know that if we adopted or used a surrogate I would not only be starting over but my Future Child would basically be an only child. Basically my Brain and heart are in conflict. So my question is are there other almost empty nesters going thru the same thing. Am  I needlessly letting a maybe diagnosis stop me from completing are family? We have had extended family go thru loosing a spouse to Alzheimer's. When children were young it was Horrible.

So a few days ago my 17 year old son wasn’t at home and I was putting some clothes up in his room. I noticed a small orange thing on the ground, after inspecting it, it seemed to be an ecstasy tablet. I wasn’t completely sure but was confused, as I’ve only known of him smoking marijuana and that was over a year ago. 

After searching through his room for a few minutes, I found a small box in the top of his closet with an almost full THC cartridge(which I couldn’t identify at the time). So when my son got back, I asked him what both the tablet and vape are. He didn’t know what the tablet is, but told me that the vape is a THC cartridge that he’s had for months but barely used. We later confirmed the identity of the tablet as a shaped sprinkle that came from a brand of cookies we usually buy. 

He told me that the vape was to relax occasionally, and that he only uses it on some weekends to not affect school. He also explained how when used in moderation, it won’t affect his “hippocampus” and memory. I believe him when it comes to not using it much, because he’s usually really close on weekdays but on some recent weekends, he’s distant and I don’t see him too much. I’m still not sure about it causing brain damage, he seemed confident about his information. Yet I’m still holding onto the vape and don’t know what to do with it. 

On one hand I don’t want him to resent me or be secretive for not giving him privacy and searching his room, yet I want to be assertive and unbiased. The time I found him smoking marijuana and grounded him a year ago, he went through a rebellious phase. And at this age it could be counterproductive to possibly put him in that phase because it could cause worse actions than without it. 

I appreciate any responses, thanks. 

TLDR: I found a weirdly shaped sprinkle on the ground of my 17 year old sons room, thought it was ecstasy, searched his room and found an almost full THC cartridge that he had had for quite some time. He proved that it was only used in moderation, and to relax occasionally. I don’t want him to get very secretive or go through a rebellious phase so I’m still holding onto it, I also want to be assertive but I’m still not entirely sure what to do.

Girl got a cell phone for her 13th birthday, despite my protestations. You don’t give a new driver a Ferrari, maybe a 20 year old truck. “I just want her to be normal and popular” was her mom’s argument.

Won’t bore you with details but it came out today that Girl has multiple TikTok and Insta accounts. I looked through the TikTok vids and while most are funny, cute, playful, some cross the line for me (E.g., clumsy quasi-erotic dancing to “WAP,” etc). 

Her mom has claimed in the past that she “has it all under control” using some app for parents for her to monitor what Girl does on her phone. I guess the Chris Brown song about “I’m tryna fuck you and not have a baby” slipped past.

I am an Aurelian stoic, and a very hands-off parent when it comes to my kids’ education in the world. Yes, I will protect you, I will teach you, I will guide you, but “Go outside, poke a snake, get some scratches, and don’t come in until supper time.” I do believe that is a fine way to allow children to learn their strengths and weaknesses. 

However, here I am at an impasse. I worry about this new cyber landscape where my 13 year old has 500 followers on a TikTok account and in my (parentally paranoid) mind , half are grown men.

We have a son and I don’t know much about raising/supporting girls,  any advice (big or small) on how we make this as safe and comfortable for her as possible would be beyond welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: this may seem like a bit of an arrogant assumption but every friend and family member we’ve discussed this with has said something along the lines of “it’s wonderful that you would help her” and told us ""what a great thing"" we are doing etc...  Please don’t, we are not doing anything great or wonderful, we simply have been presented with a young person who is in a horrible situation and I fully believe any functioning adult would do what we are doing if they were in our position.

Can anyone give any tips to 1) Motivate her to learn and 2) advise which techniques to use to start riding on her own?

Should the amount be calculated via my own income, the joint income of my household, the age of the child, or something else? I think $100/month is okay, but she has some expensive hobbies — beekeeping, for instance — that I want to support.

So far, she is the opposite of a spoiled brat. As a former spoiled brat, I can tell. However, I don't want her to think that money falls out of the sky.

This is going to be long. To give you guys some background first- I am 21, me and my fiancé have taken in my two siblings (15 &amp; 16) this past year. Their father was physically and mentally abusive growing up, and when we were with my mother, which was barely, she was also mentally abusive. Things seems almost too good to be true when we first bought our home and all moved in together, and they were. Over the past 6 months things have gotten bad for me and my sister. She’s rude, disrespectful, lies about just about anything, and was constantly threatening suicide. We had family discussions and things would be okay for a week maybe two, and then we were back to square one. So I got her in to see a therapist. That also seemed to help a lot. She started driving soon after so I gave her freedom and trust and basically let her live her life. Well that backfired on me because she had a bad acid trip with her friends and ended up in the hospital strapped to the bed. We had another family discussion. About the consequences of her actions, her mental health, and how she treats others. She was grounded for 3 weeks and complained constantly. She’s been ungrounded for a little over 3 weeks now, and today we had another argument. It’s honestly a bi-weekly thing at this point. She was throwing up this morning at school (which has been going on for weeks) and said it was her anxiety. But she was out with her friends in public all weekend, so I said what’s the difference between school and being out with your friends? What triggers the anxiety? And she took it as me being mean and basically just shut down. But this was over text. Fast forward to JUST NOW, I ask her about her day at school and she’s snappy and rude with me. It escalated into a full fledged argument where she said all I do is be mean to her and make her cry.

What do I do? Please believe me when I say I have been kind, patient, and sympathetic to everything that has happened. There has been numerous incidents where I could have reacted poorly and I’ve held it together. I don’t want to be our mother and I just want to give them a better childhood than I had. I know most of her actions is a result of the abuse we endured growing up, but when does some responsibility fall on her? She won’t eat, hardly sleeps, won’t take the medication her therapist gave her, and doesn’t communicate with me at all. Do I just let her be this way? Do I keep pushing? I’m so lost. I’ve called about family therapy but haven’t received a response. Everything I do is wrong in her eyes. And I know she isn’t going to understand because she is the child and I’m trying to be the parent, but the way she treats me (and everyone tbh) is awful. 

Please someone give me advice. I’m only 21 and don’t know how to be a mom/sister. I’m riding the line on punishment/patience 24/7.

Our agreement was that we would pay for the car, but he pays for the gas, insurance and start saving to cover maintenance and his insurance deductible. 

His job is a kitchen apprentice at a local and very popular breakfast and lunch restaurant. We are friends with the owners so that is how he got the job. Because it’s food service, restaurant has trouble getting and keeping good people, but there is a lot of staff that has been there for years. People don’t show up for interviews or decide at the test shift, they can’t handle the pressure when people are lined up out the door. The restaurant owners joked that they wanted to hire my son because he would show up. Well, 3rd week into his job and we were eating breakfast and one of the owners pops out of the kitchen to grab something and we exchange a “Hi”. That is when he tells us that we did a good job with raising my son. He is working hard and diligently in the kitchen. This made me so happy I almost cried. As I see my son become a man, it is incredible to know that what I taught him actually stuck. I told him my job as a parent is to make sure he is a good human and a positive member of society.

I (33F) have a 14 y/o son. I know that it's normal for teenagers to lie, not give a shit about helping out, struggle with being responsible, etc. I know he's got a lot of changes that he's going through and there are a lot of hormones/emotions for him to process through. However, I also know that still doesn't excuse his behavior and he still has to have consequences for his actions.

Background: My son is in virtual school for the semester due to COVID-19. I have a job where I work weekends but have three days off during the week. My son, my boyfriend and I all live together and my boyfriend is home with my son when I'm at work. When school started, I gave my son a printed-out schedule outlining how he was supposed to spend his time during his school day and his responsibilities around the house (take trash out, empty dishwasher, sweep, etc.). He has to message me when he starts school and when he's done with school. He also has to spend an hour of his time engaging in some hobby that doesn't involve electronics (he loves video games and would spend all day doing it otherwise). 

Here's my issue. He will lie to me about being done with school and about his hour of free time so that he can sneak onto his laptop to play games. He does this when he doesn't realize my boyfriend is awake (my boyfriend has a weird sleep schedule) and thinks he can get away with it. He recently got grounded for a week for lack of responsibility. I just grounded him again yesterday for a week for lying to me about doing his hour of free time when he really didn't. I gave him four hours of electronic time on his birthday as a ""present"" and he lied about how much time he actually spent on his laptop. He informed me that grounding him just makes him want to sneak around more to play games. I told him if he continued to lie to me then I would set a rule that he would not be allowed to use his laptop for anything except school while I was at work. However, I feel at my wits' end and don't know if what I'm doing is working or I should be doing more. These games are also how he communicates with his friends and cousin (who is like his best friend) so I don't want to just permanently take that away from him. We also are a family of gamers so I understand that this is his main interest, but it becomes an issue when it takes away from him completing his responsibilities and not being honest. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

He's an odd kid in that he has no friends as such, he like i was is painfully shy, he has no real interests as such apart from playing his Xbox.  He left school in June with the hope of doing an apprenticeship at college but with Covid he couldn't get an employer placement so my boss took pity and took him in and he's in with me for a year.  He like I was is over weight, I see my colleagues looking at him and little whispers, they wouldn't dare say anything smart to him but I know them judging looks all too well and they are judging me as well as their kids are all university graduates in fancy jobs and they do love to boast about them.

The road he is on is not easy, life generally gives you crap, I was over weight, shy, never had a girl friend until I was 20, spent most of my life putting up with crap in dead end jobs and as I say it lead me to years of depression and anxiety, I was a doormat.

I’m a single mom of a 13 year old young man. He is struggling with many self love and confidence issues. I’m lost. Any advice on how to help him find his happiness and support him through this tough time? He struggles with weight and possibly depression. Men of Reddit how can I help him!?

I have an amazing teen. He was a preemie, and was a mere 3 pounder when born. He has played soccer in younger years, was involved in Boy Scouts. And last year started Jr High football. 

Since March, when school went virtual I’ve noticed him becoming withdrawn, likely borderline depressed. I’ve talked to him without being direct- and tried to find out what is bothering him.

Also since March, he has gone full blown puberty! His voice has changed and he has facial and body hair that would put some grown men to shame. I’ve invested in nice grooming care gear for him and try to encourage him to treat himself and his body as well. He is self conscious about his unibrow and we do our eyebrows as well as nail care bi-weekly to monthly.

He seems to be coming (SLOWLY) our of the funk. However, the last two days have been hard on him. Over spring/summer he outgrew his 32s, then 33s, 34s and 35 in waist pants. He is extremely upset all of the new clothes I’ve bought him aren’t fitting. 

I have been concerned he may have diabetes. His dr
Wants him to have a 5 hr GTT next month, but I’m taking I and Os, daily caloric intake, charting activities, and documentation of his polyphagia, polyuria, as well as his never ending thirst. I’m thinking he may have some insulin resistance or perhaps even childhood onset DM 1. The nurse in me worries.

Should it not be a medical issue, I know he is simply defeated by his appearance. It’s killing me to see him struggle and begin to hate his body. This kid has been through so much in his life because of me. And the guilt is awful.

We are very close and I’m thankful he opens up to me, but I’m feeling helpless. Most clothes he has are new with tags, and he doesn’t want me to return them
For larger sizes, but I honestly need to! I can’t afford to replace his wardrobe otherwise. 

In the last month, he has had stretch marks that
Are increasing daily. They’re at the red and angry stage. I tried to call his insecurities by showing him my pics from when I was cheering at his age and my
Visible stretch marks. But nothing seems to calm his fears. It is breaking my heart to watch the light fade from his eyes. The stretch marks are everywhere and started only a month ago or so.
The cover his hips, upper thight, tricep area, arm pits, inner thight, and lower belly. He is starting to have enlarged, puffy nipples as well as a classic “cortisol belly”. 

I have full physical custody of my boys. Their dad gets them when he can, but not for regular court ordered visitation. And asking for child support of $200/mo proved to be like pissing in the wind. More than the financial support, the oldest son especially is greatly affected by his dad not being around all the time, and not responding to calls and messages. I understand I need to try to step up and cover as much as I can that he’s missing from Dad- but I think you guys will agree it’s no substitute for the advice a father
Gives to his son. 


Last weekend, the older boy started hunting with some of my family. Granted, we are not as close of a family as we were most of my life, being around the men in my extended family and goin on hunts has peaked his interest and is something he has fallen in love with! This past week, I’ve been trying to get him into 4H shooting club. But I would really appreciate some advice from you guys on how I can better support my baby and help him with his issues- self esteem, as well as the void I can see he has when it comes to a male role model. 

Parenting seems the perfect community to be able to seek some good advice. Due to the pandemic, even I have had trouble getting an appointment for my therapist. The younger boy is on the spectrum and even he is having issues getting an appt for his therapist. Today, I called most of the providers that accept our Molina insurance and so far no luck. Most aren’t accepting new patients, or don’t work with adolescents, or are booked out for months. 

I really want to help foster a healthy way for him to cope with insecurities, as well as realize all the amazing gifts he has. He is 5’6 at 13 and weight is now at 180. He checks the scale daily, even when I have tried to be adamant that he doesn’t obsess over the numbers on the scale.

He is so understanding that Mom is in a bad place financially, and that the pandemic made our situation more dire that before. He expressed today that he doesn’t want me to return the clothes I can for him to get some that fit. And I can respect that. As a woman I have a few totes of “skinny clothes” in my attic- as my weight fluctuates sizes from size 6- size 12 bc of the steroids I’m treated with for some major traumatic MVA injuries. So I “get it”. But not sure how I can make him realize the logic that I need to return the literal wardrobe he has that are NWT to replace them for stuff that fits him well and compliment his body type. 

I know it’s a long spill, but I’m truly desperate for help with handling this. I miss the sparkle in his eyes. Seeing his confident and self love diminish is heartbreaking for me. Any advice guys on how I could go about healing my boy’s negative self image? Any way to help him feel comfortable in his own skin.

I understand that taking him to pick out nice flattering and well fit wardrobe would likely do wonders, and I plan on it next month with hopes his dad pays his child support. Things are desolate financially for me. But I will take him next month when I get a little extra money I hope. Being disabled and in the process of appealing for disability has been a multiple year
Pain in the ass ordeal. But I always find a way.
He is understanding that I have been doing all I can. So besides buying him clothes for his body type, what else can I do to help my baby.

You guys seem to be a supportive sub and I’m hoping you can give me some advice on how YOU guys would want this handled if you were this kind souled 13 year

Her school is ~1/2 mile from her grandmother’s house.  The vast majority of kids at her school get dropped off and picked up every day; I’m talking like 99% of the kids.  I think a little exercise is good for her.   The clincher is that her backpack is legitimately  25-30 lbs since no lockers due to Covid rules.   She told me that her back and shoulders get sore from carrying all the weight, but I think she’s just a little soft.  She’s athletic but out of shape due to organized sport season cancellations.

He is on the autism spectrum. If I were to describe where he’s at, I would consider him higher functioning in the sense that he can bathe himself, make himself basic meals, get dressed, etc. 

My parenting style with him has always been open and loving. I’ve always expressed love and praise toward him. However, the way he acts someone might assume it’s very different. 

He is not affectionate with anyone. He is very abrupt and rude, especially with older family members, such as his aunts, uncles, grandparents and his parents. He acts as though most people inconvenience him. 

I always tell him I love him. He is reluctant to say it back, and if he does, it’s always in a sarcastic, laborious tone. 

He is home schooled, but even getting him to do things for his schooling is also difficult. For instance, a few years ago he decided that he doesn’t want to read books. To him, he wants to get his information solely from the internet. I have told him that if he is to finish high school, he is going to be required to read actual books and to make book reports. When trying to discuss this with him, the waterworks begin and he shuts down. Because of covid, these things seem much worse, as he isn’t able to really socialize much with anyone outside of home. 

He doesn’t want to even see friends in person. 

When trying to get him to help out, it’s like pulling teeth. He does or forces a person to accept the bare minimum or below minimum of effort from him for anything and everything. Many sites I read say that praise works well with autistic children, but he is unresponsive or dismissive. He will say he “hates” everything. There’s nothing outside of video games that makes him happy. 

When I try to discuss these things with him, he shuts down/gets mad. When I try to discipline him, he gets mad. When I try to be open and loving, he shuts me out and doesn’t take me seriously. I am at the end of my rope. 

I am at the point where I am not even sure how to parent him anymore. I feel defeated as a parent. I love him but I am sick of being treated like I don’t matter. I am angry, resentful and upset that I have sacrificed and done so much for him, and he genuinely doesn’t care.   

I know it’s not right to compare, but I even notice children who have had less of a happy or ideal upbringing have more love, compassion and respect toward their mother and families than my son does. They will do things for their families or help out, and my son doesn’t. He doesn’t want to do anything. No matter what I’ve done, he doesn’t give a shit. 

Has anyone else had this issue, or currently experiencing it? What are some things you’ve done to rectify or help? Any advice at this point would be helpful.

emotionally I'm done. I can't make more of an effort than he's willing to. He's sees a therapist, I'm just lost and clueless if I should just let him fail and see if he fixes himself gameless and phoneless until he decides he needs help or wants to change or?

Elder one was exceptionally good in math and very rarely needed help. Younger one struggled from elementary school. We tried enrolling her in many private tutoring and online classes but she was doing rather poorly. She was convinced that she is ‘not smart’ like her sister.
Recently, me dad (background Stem field, with university teaching experience) decided to jump in and was able to help her dramatically. Writing this down, hoping it will help someone.

1. Many teachers teaches kids to apply formulas or methodologies with out ensuring basics are clear. Kids look for certain key words and try apply formulas rather than understanding problem and solving it. In this approach, if a math problem needs a concept from past, kids wont be able to apply it. 

How I tried to fix it:
Try to get all info from problem and and ‘set it up’. Eg if problem states the shape is a cube, possibly sides are equal etc.
Now comeup with a plan to solve it. Write the plan in English. They should be able explain why they are doing it. Do not skimp. Let it take time. Try to be descriptive.
Now try to solve it.

This approach was painfully slow, and will frustrate kids initially. But soon they will see results. 

2. Let them attempt the problems without help. If they give up, give hints. Also explain how you figured out that was the direction. Ask them why they couldnt figure it out. This will expose gaps in knowledge and understanding. Go back to Khan academy or youtube and brush up.

Sometimes they will get a mental block and wont see the obvious. That is ok. If it is something they should know, give them a very subtle hint. Also ask them to think why they didnt see it. After every problem, do a retrospective.


3. Convince them that math is all about practice. There is Nothing called smarts. Take breaks, but keep the focus. It is really a slow grind than a sprint. Share their pain and be patient. 


4. Set a realistic stretch goal( something she think she cannot do.) It will be a huge confidence boost once the child actually reaches it.
In her case, there was a Math Kangaroo test which she failed miserably. My promise was by end of 2months, she will be able to do it all by herself. To my surprise, she was able to do most of it in a month. 

I cant claim that she loves math now. But her paralyzing fear to the subject is definitely gone.

While they were little people would tehe and laugh saying “wait for teenage years.” A big part of me thought it was silly and that these squishy little people would NEVER grow up to hate me.

I wanted to give you a message about why knowledge, and your education, is more valuable long term, than the quick and easy pleasure and satisfaction of video games and movies. I want you to take a moment to think about this.

When you are playing a game or watching a movie, it feels great right? You are relaxed, having a good time, and enjoying the experience. You want to do more of this good stuff, since it makes you happy, who wouldn’t want to do this all day every day right? 

But this pleasure, and this good experience, this only lasts as long as you are doing the activity. Once you stop your game, or stop watching a movie, how many times have you turned your device off and went from being happy and feeling good, to feeling bad? Or even angry and annoyed that you have to go back to the real world? I know I’ve had this many times. That positive experience and happiness disappears, and you have nothing left to show for it. You cant get that happiness back, unless you play the game or watch the movie again. But in life, how often are you going to have time for that? 

You know where long lasting happiness and pleasure come from? Developing a skill, or competence. In our case I’m talking about developing skills in maths. Skills and techniques that you can actually use to solve problems. The pleasure from having a skill doesn’t disappear, because once you learned that skill, it will always stay with you.

And you know whats the best part? You can share skills with others! If you learn how to play guitar, not only are you feeling absolutely fantastic about the beautiful songs you can play, that you learned by yourself, but you can also play those songs for others. Do you know how amazing that feels? I play piano myself, and nobody can take that away from me. It always makes me happy, and even when I’m not playing piano, I can feel happy, knowing that I worked hard to be good at piano and it’s a skill I can be proud of. 

Can you share a movie or a game with others? sure, but then you're all experiencing just another empty moment, and afterward the experience, there is nothing left, nothing impactful, nothing that enriched your lives or relationships and friendships with one another. 

The same goes for your schooling. Once you develop knowledge, you also start to develop pride in yourself and what you know and can do. It feels great to smash your SAC’s. It feels great to get those high marks in exams. And if you’re competitive, it feels great to beat other people in tests at school right? Let that competitiveness motivate you, if not in competition with others, then in competition with yourself, to always be setting new benchmarks of your skills and abilities.

They’re kind, respectful, responsible, good students, etc etc... (and they’re teenagers!). I’m a pretty laid back mom because honestly, whether it’s good parenting or just dumb luck, my kids have always been pretty easy going themselves. But everyone makes mistakes... We moved to this town 2 years ago and it hasn’t been an easy adjustment for my son. He’s well liked and got involved in extra-curricular activities but he still misses his old friends. He still spends his free time playing online games with them. This year has been especially tough, stuck in the house, in a town he doesn’t like, with little to do. He had wanted to get a summer job but that didn’t work out. And his grandparents (my in-laws) have been gravely ill from Covid-19 (getting better though). He’s been very good about helping out around the house and mowing, so I’ve been more lenient than usual about his gaming. Until today. School started remote learning a couple weeks ago here, but his friends have not started school yet. I’ve noticed he’s had trouble getting back on track and it’s because he’s staying up late playing. I gave him some stern warnings, and this morning he was up early and ready to get to work. I was impressed. Until around 9:00 when it became obvious he didn’t wake up early, he had stayed up all night! I was having to keep waking him up in between classes. I was so mad. As soon as class was done I dragged him out to the car to run errands with me. His eyes were bloodshot and he looked miserable. First stop to the county dump to haul trash, and he got to unload it. Back in the car. Every time he started to nod off I sprayed him with my water bottle. I lectured him the whole time about how he not only acted irresponsibly but also forced me to take time away from my own work. Next stop the grocery store. I made him push the cart and put every item in it. Then he got to pay all $94 of it with his debit card. He loaded the groceries in the car. Went home. He carried them all in and put them all away. Next we went to the park for a mile long walk around the lake. In the rain. I had a hoodie on. He didn’t. Got home and he helped me fix dinner. By this point he was about to drop and asked me how much longer he has to stay up. I said at least 8:00. He went to get a shower to help him wake up a bit, then came out, gave me a hug and told me he’d do better from now on. I’m not sure if I handled this the right way or not (this was so unlike me), but I’m proud of my son for his response to it. I think it might have scared him to see his mom go crazy like this.

1. Mental illness is very real and often times can rapidly get worse. If your child needs help, get them help ASAP.


2. Parents don’t always know best, because they’re not teens and can’t know everything. Teens don’t know best, because we’re fucking idiots. What’s best for us is somewhere in the middle of those two. 



3. We need privacy. If you have a teen, it’s not your job to police their friendships or romance life. But PLEASE teach them that sex is okay as long as it’s safe. In the US where I live, the sex education is truly awful, so it’s on the parents to teach it right.

Good evening everyone, I am a single father of two boys, 14 and 17 years old. I have concerns regarding both of them but right now I am primarily concerned with the older. I feel bad for saying this about my own son but in the interest of being honest I will say it. He is probably the most deceitful and lazy person I have ever encountered in my life. I did what I thought was best during his upbringing but having an ex-wife that was extremely belligerent towards me and my second wife (during which we/I got sole custody) didn't help. I am now divorced again (which I will leave alone) but now I am at my wit's end. The children's mother can't get her life together (despite thousands of dollars I have spent trying to help her get her shit together) and isn't any real help. I am not trying to frame myself as a perfect parent. I know I have plenty of problems. At this point though I don't know what to do. All he does it sit around and fuck off and eat everything I have in my kitchen. He has zero regard for anyone else and will readily steal food that was meant for other people. I have literally caught him on video doing things and have shown him and he will still deny shit and throw out more lies. Help me out please because I dont want to  just kick him the fuck out when , hopefully, he graduates.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2683485,public,self,I am at my wit's end with my 17 year old.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ip8bck/i_am_at_my_wits_end_with_my_17_year_old/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

They are here except every other weekend and a Wednesday dinner, so we are the primary parental figures involved and handle 100% of the school stuff. Note, I don’t go hands on with any of this, so it is her call, but we discuss and she isn’t on Reddit. 

My SS15 has always had issues turning assignments in.  Even if he completes them, they aren’t turned in. He seems to have either a concern about them being ""perfect"" (if they tax his genuinely significant brainpower), or a concern about wasting time (if they don’t).  So he has tons of uncompleted assignments. Then he fails classes and ends up in summer school.  On the years it doesn’t end up with summer school, there is a lot of catchup work, tears, and meltdowns trying to turn a bunch of work in at the last minute with our help, and still lots of ""0"" in the gradebook.  Nobody enjoys any of this...not us, not him. 

He has had behavioral and learning disability evaluations, he has dysgraphia that we work around by allowing him to type or dictate his work, and he has support to get things done (down to one of us sitting with him to mindmap for an essay he is overwhelmed by, being his typist, or generally ANY assistance he requests).  As long as he's trying, and turning in SOMETHING, we are happy. 

At the start of 6th grade, we made him a deal...give us ONE quarter/trimester of every assignment being turned in, and we will get you a smartphone.  They don't have to be on time, they don't have to get passing grades...just turned in. He agreed happily and readily to this plan.

Well - now he's starting 10th grade.  And we have NEVER had a quarter or trimester that met that goal.  Neither of us imagined that when we made this agreement, we would get anywhere NEAR this age without meeting it. Even when he failed English last year, and so had to take summer school which had far fewer assignments...and even when we told him, looking at the grade book, ""hey, if you just turned in in this one missing assignment, you get your smart phone""...he doesn't do it.  Even with COVID last Spring, with standards being WAY reduced and only very few assignments due, with us reminding him of the stakes and offering supports, it didn't get done.

We have been on the receiving end of a few “well everyone ELSE has a PHONE"" comments lately, and I commiserate. It’s a bit odd for a 15 year old not to have one. But we made an agreement that is well within his ability to meet, and no matter what help we offer, he doesn’t. 

What do we do?!?

I'm a grateful stepmom to two boys. They were 8 and 12 when they let me into their lives. Honestly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, it was bumpy with the older guy for the first little while. I never tried to be his mom, but it was a little easier to build a relationship with the younger guy. 

Anyways, years have gone by. It's true what they say- kids grow up. The older dude doesn't live at home anymore; his wings have spread and they work. So proud. The younger guy is in his last year of secondary school, and is coming out of a tail-spin that lasted two years. So proud. Things change, and still, I'm so proud.

Tonight was an impromptu throwback to when we did family dinner at the dining room table, except better. My husband and I reached out to the older guy to see if he wanted to come over for dinner. He said yes, so we mentioned to the younger guy that we were having dinner and that it'd be great if he could join us. 

There were no phones at the table, lots of ""thank you for dinners"", the boys cleared the table, we played Catan, and there were no verbal jabs between brothers as there had been when they were younger. Neither kid was squirming, just waiting to get away.

The simply discard whatever they are done with and leave it where they used it. 

I've always tried to get them to clean up after themselves but they just don't.

Outside of their bedrooms I clean up the house every few days. Because I clean every few days it doesn't get terribly bad. 

Their rooms on the other hand...

I've taken to going in there every other month and literally doing a deep clean myself. 

My youngest doesn't mind so much and he will actually work with me on it. 

The older one gets angry about it because it is an invasion of his privacy. I absolutely get that. I think back to when I was his age and I don't think my room was much better but it was clean enough not to attract pests like ants because I had an incident because I had a habit of eating in bed where I woke up covered in ants. From that moment on I was a cleaner kid...

This has happened to my older son at least a couple of times but still he discards food garbage wantonly wherever - under his bed, to the side, EVERYWHERE. It's GROSS. 

They have been at their mom's this weekend and I have been working on their rooms. The primary intent was to set them up with good learning spaces in their rooms so they can do their school work in a comfortable workspace. The younger one and I were at odds with how I planned to configure his room but I was able to keep it the way he wanted AND do what I wanted so when we were facetiming yesterday and I showed him he was happy and wanted to work with me on finishing it up. 

I started the older one's yesterday. OMFG

I can't even. He just doesn't take a moment to care for his space - NOT ONE MOMENT. So much, so disgusting. 

How can I get through to him? I don't want to punish him, I don't want to fight with him about it I just want him to care more for himself and his space. He's going through stuff, I know there is a component of depression going on. COVID has been hard on him and he and I are at odds often. He is diagnosed oppositional and ADHD and he is in Therapy and honestly we're getting ready to start a more intensive outpatient program to help him and I interact better.

He responded by explaining that he would love to have friends and he would if everyone in our town wasn’t a “greasy redneck”. He explained that whenever he try’s to do anything with kids his age all they do is talk about 4 wheelers, playing hockey, and hunting, all stuff which my son has no interest in. More recently i’ve been finding him a lot more irritable and angry with myself and his mother, I asked what was troubling him and he started yelling about how we’ve totally screwed him over for moving out of the city. He feels that if we still lived in a city there would actually be people he could relate to and be friends with, instead of just talking to people online. What bothers me is that I feel like he’s right. I don’t want to blame myself for moving, I still feel like it was the right move for our family, but I really do feel like i’m limiting his opportunities. What should I do here?

A couple years ago she ‘dated’ this boy, her age, for about a year and then they broke up. He proceeded to talk ugly about her, wrote mean things about her in a song, and then hopped from one girl to the next. Basically whoever would give him attention. We live in a small village and his dad is the mayor/correctional officer, so of course his son is spoiled. And by spoiled I mean his parents buy him whatever he wants, even allowed him to put on a ‘rap concert’ for his friends in his backyard with his dad snapping all these pictures and video (which I find completely strange but whatever).

Fast forward to last week, and she’s decided to become his girlfriend again. I told my daughter I don’t agree with this because of how he treated her and seems to treat other girls, but I won’t stop her. Two days ago I was talking to my sister-in-law and venting about how my kid is back with him again, and she said that he will never speak to her daughter again because he sent her dick pics in March. I was floored. So of course I told my daughter that she needed to check into this and sure enough, after talking with her cousin (who received the pictures), and then talking to the boy who admitted he did it, she blocked him on her phone. For a day. Now she’s back to texting him and has decided she wants to be his girlfriend.

I feel like I’ve failed to instill any kind of self-respect. I just cannot fathom why she wants to put herself in the same situation as before with this kid, especially now that we know he sends unsolicited dick pics to his female peers.

My husband's niece is 14. I've been with him since she was 4, so have known her for 10 years. We haven't been around her a whole lot honestly. She's bounced from house to house (her paternal grandmother, her maternal grandmother, her moms &amp; stepdads, her dads and stepmoms. It's just a huge mess. Her maternal grandmother had more respect from me than my own mother. I loved her so much. She was very dear. Before she passed away 2 years ago, I'd talk about my niece with her. You see her parents are huge, *huge* screw ups. They have been on meth, in and out of jail, etc. She's had little to no stability. She did live with her maternal grandmother for a period of time and was doing very well. Good grades, was engaging, etc. Once her mother met a guy, ugh...I'm sorry to say who was released from jail after a number of years, they moved away. It's been a catastrophe ever since. Anyway, sorry for the scatterbrainedness. I promised my MIL that I would do everything I could to protect my niece. She wanted to make sure she wasn't pregnant by 14, end up in jail, on drugs, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week she stayed with us. The way she talks is just sickening. She's not mean, well...she doesn't *try* to be mean. She did say to me, ""You're uncultured swine."", after I told her I didn't know who someone she was talking about was. I told her that was unacceptable and to never speak to me like that again or I would take her phone away from her. She has had her nose in that phone since she's been here. She literally only puts it down when she's sleeping. A few minutes ago someone sent her a picture and she said to me, ""Look!"" So, I looked and there was a penis on her phone. I told her to give me her phone. She was on snapchat. I messaged the guy/kid/whatever that he better never send that shit to her again. And that I would do him and tell his parents. He said, ""She's in sex chat group.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course she doesn't live with us. So, do I even have a say so? Idk what to do guys. This isn't the first insanely sexual thing that she's done. Apparently she sent nudes to a 30 year old. She said she never did that. Her stepmother lies about things and is very manipulative. My niece lies about dumb things. Her dad is a compulsive liar. Her step mom said, ""Idk what to do anymore."" I encouraged her repeatedly to go to family therapy and all I got for a response is excuses as to why they *couldn't*do it. What do I do??

So I have twins, a boy and a girl, and they’re 16. This morning, my daughter asked me bluntly “So I was wondering if I can get a vibrator.” I said I’ll think about it and here I am, on Reddit. As you can tell, she’s shameless about her sexuality. I’m generally pretty progressive about this stuff and I don’t really care how she expresses herself or if she has safe sex (age of consent is 16 here). In other words, as long as she buys it with her own money, she can get a vibrator. I’m just not sure I want to set this precedent, as if my son finds out then he may want something. And generally, my daughter may begin buying more of this kind of stuff and I don’t want my house to start looking like a sex shop. I feel like it’s almost unfair to my son because he deserves to express his sexuality with a toy if he so pleases, and I don’t want to come across as giving my daughter privileges.

Im 18, almost 19, and I take care of my younger sister (13) since we both experienced childhood abuse by our parents. We finally left after I barely turned 18. Yesterday, my sister started explaining to me how she felt, her worsening anxiety issues, ect. She’s clearly super traumatized by the situations we’ve experienced, and I feel like I’m a failure of a parental figure for it. Even though I wasn’t her guardian back then, I was still her only “protector”. I failed to protect her from the mental abuse and now she’s mentally ill because of it. 

So, now to my question: parents/other guardians, how do you deal with feeling at fault for your child’s mental illness? And how do you help them beyond getting them treatment?

(Also, we are already having professional help with our mental issues. She has already getting help for a year or so (for her anxiety disorder, not her trauma related issues), but I’m now in contact with her psychiatrist to make sure she can get a better, more effective treatment for both anxiety and trauma related issues.)

Lastly, I apologize if this question doesn’t exactly fit in this sub since I’m not her mother and am just her older sister who is her guardian (along with a grandmother who provides financial support).

In her high school for example, there is a work program that is for students with disabilities only. Honestly, sounds like the best program that they should offer to students who feel they could use the help but my daughter doesn’t qualify, yet in my mind I do feel like she could use all the assistance they offer with the amazing tools and guidance and internships.

Facebook memories just showed me the pictures of us celebrating last year.

This year I doubt she will even to see us. 

She was in our custody for 2 years while her mom was in jail. We did so much for her. She’s never had a stable home, so we tried to give her that. We were very open and upfront with her. At first she had a lot of freedom, but then she started betraying our trust. We would tell her “if you do X for Y amount of time you will get Z privilege back, we just need to see you try” 

Instead she just found new ways to get around X. So we had to add more restrictions. Try new punishments/reward systems. She was in group counseling through the school and we tried to get her into more therapy, but we are low income with 0 assistance for her. So we couldn’t afford most places, and anywhere that offered free help had a ridiculous waiting list or wouldn’t take her before age 13. We were again upfront with her about it and told her we were doing what we could and tried to find alternative help for her and get her around adults she felt comfortable talking to (example: my best friend would take her for ice cream and niece would talk her head off)

We tried so hard to be there for her and help her avoid the path her mother took. But she idolized her mother. Nothing we did would make her see that the way her mom lives isn’t okay, and just because you grew up in that type of environment doesn’t mean it has to define you. But she’s convinced that she has to go down the same path as her mom. 

Well, moms out of jail now. Niece wants nothing to do with us. She has talked openly about how she hates us for being “rich and white” which is laughable because A. She’s white. B. We are nowhere near rich, but both work, own our home, and have enough to sometimes eat out and see a movie. 

She openly defends gang life style, brags about how she isn’t scared of the “ghetto” areas in our city and we don’t know what we are talking about when we say it’s not safe. DHs a corrections officer and wouldn’t let her visit areas where he knows for a fact criminals straight out of jail live. 

SIL and my MIL let her do whatever the hell she wants. They let her go see whoever unsupervised and then complain when she comes home covered in hickeys. Even her cousin, who was her best friend, says she doesn’t want to be around her due to her behavior and the company she keeps. 

We tried so hard for 2 years, but it wasn’t enough to undo years of damage. We have our own three year old son and now a second child who will be here any day now. I hate that we’ve given up on helping her, but I can’t do it anymore. I miss her and want her well, but we never had the resources to give her all the help she needed. Instead we just turned ourselves into the bad guys who will never understand her.

Sorry for the long post, but I’m just pregnant and emotional at the moment.

His family are very much avid Trump supporters. His mom's political beliefs have rubbed off on him and he is constantly posting political memes and sometimes really offensive stuff. I usually just ignore it. I don't care if you are a TRUMP supporter or not. It's not about the politics but there was a big argument today when he posted something about racism saying something to the affect of there would be no racism if we all just quit talking about it. His aunt, who is half black, posted a comment saying ""Or people could just not be racist"". After that she started getting very negative comments from people. I made a comment taking up for her. I then was off FB for awhile but when I logged back on my nephew had made some new post about someone starting shit on his FB page and then reporting him because apparently the post or some of the comments were no longer there. People then started commenting asking what BITCH had reported him and he says my name. I was floored because I in NO WAY reported him for his post. I had no clue what he was talking about. I also couldn't believe he would let some random person call his aunt a bitch. I posted that he had the wrong person and i would never report someone for something on fb and that him calling me out like that on fb was rude as hell because you don't do that if you don't have evidence anyway. It turned into a shit show and my own nephew called me ""stupid AF"" and in the end I was just so shocked at the way he was talking to me and everything that I blocked my own nephew on fb. My four kids would never talk to me that way and have never talked to any of their aunts or uncles with anything but the utmost respect. I know I shouldn't have even engaged and argued with a 15 year old but it hasn't been the best of days either (my dad just had to have 3 stents put in today and i couldn't be at hospital with him due to COVID, plus my mom broke both her legs and i had to go give her a bath). 

Are kids really like this these days? Am I the only one that still believes that there should still be a level of respect there? I've never been nothing but good to my nephew so I just don't get it.

Also how do I go about talking with her on what happened? Do I just leave it alone or do I dive in head-on and let her do most of the talking?


Backstory:
She is 15 and her current guardian found video of her and a 25yo grown ass man on her phone having sex. The police were contacted and the guy and his mother were both arrested (mom was arrested because she knew and warned him not to get caught, but still allowed it to happen.) he got bailed out and contacted her little sister and made threats towards her life. That is why she's moving here because my spouse and I live 3hrs away and no one from her hometown know where we live. So we are taking her in to protect her. Both of her parents are not in the picture so we are her last resort for some kinda safety from this person.

15 yr old just got her restricted driver's license 3 days ago (allowed to drive to school and work only, no minor passengers allowed except siblings). Good kid, great student.

So she calls in the middle of the night and says the cops are there and need us to come get her - luckily no charges.

Here's the part where I'm questioning myself. Me (step dad), my wife and bio dad have all been discussing what the consequences should be.

So this is where I'm questioning everything. These other parents are good people, we like them a lot. We're not particularly close, but our daughters are best friends.

Although I’ve been involved in their lives since day 1. Alexander is 17. Isaiah is 15. Mom has 1 younger daughter from another relationship. And 2 more daughters from her current marriage. 
She has had a rough time with Isaiah for the last 2 years but she fights with me refusing to allow him to live with me. So we’ve managed to maintain a decent co parenting relationship where we usually support each other’s disciplinary measures.  
And Alexander hasn’t given us any problems. Hardly any issues with the exception of the occasional attitude from Alexander. 

That’s the quick backstory for my current dilemma. 

Ok.. so Alexander going into his senior year, has a girlfriend named Marie. She’s 19 but they’ve been dating for almost 3 years now. She’s a very good influence and helps to keep Alexander focused on his academics as well as provides most of the transportation he requires for school or work related activities. She also has been helping their mom with their little sisters quite a bit lately.
However, Isaiah is very rude to her and often speaks to her with a distasteful attitude. It wasn’t always that way with him. But recently he has told me that he resents her because she’s always there. I’ve tried to keep the peace between the brothers. But I’m afraid i let it get too far. You see, Alexander really tries to defend his girlfriend but always being careful not to pick a fight with his little brother. That particular boundary seems to give Isaiah a sense of power where he openly disrespects and blatantly tells her that she’s not welcomed at their house. He’s really causing a problem in their household. In their relationships. And I’ve never condoned his rude comments or poor treatment of marie. In fact, I’ve always taught my sons to treat women with respect no matter what. I think what’s going on (in a nutshell) is that he has lost nearly all respect for his mom. And he cannot respect any other woman if he can’t respect his own mom. Am I right about that? 

I just don’t know how to go about resolving this negative cloud surrounding their household. Any advice out there would be appreciated and valued.

A week before the wedding. It was really traumatic. I left with little (refusing against my lawyers advice to fight). I was a legal assistant for years. The emotional pain of fighting a legal battle, and I did the math. It wasn’t his dad. It was a newly bought house with zero equity. The value of our assets versus the debt. He original offer sucked. But I looked at lawyers fees to make it equitable. And it was going to be like paying my old boss 5-10k for another 5-10k. Plus the emotional anguish.

I don’t regret settling. 

But over time he developed the same same hobby as my ex (billiards) It makes sense. It was the hobby that got us together in the first place. Something I loved. He became good. Like really good. Over the years he’s grown. He’s own 14. But he’s the under 18 champ in the province. He plays adult tournaments. Competes in other countries. 

A couple years ago he signed up up for an adult tournament. A week later I found out my ex did as well. My son is was 12. Itching to play and “destroy” him. I said it was a bad idea. That he’s playing to avenge my honour or some shit. In my head I was thinking that if he lost it would be emotionally painful. He was too young to fight his mothers emotional battles. And yes. Part of me didn’t want to see him. 

Back then I messaged him. I asked him to politely rescind his sign up. He did. But I also asked the league commissioner to ask him to leave. She didn’t need to because he withdrew. He actually did withdraw when I asked. 

And he wished my kid the best. And that was it. He stayed away from tournaments in my city for a couple years. Also my son won the tournament. And many more after. 

Now now it’s happened again. Except my son is exceptionally good  maybe a little rusty with covid. They are both on the list to play the tournament. They are both at the same playing field. Maybe my son is actually better now. 

But...I think my son is still hateful and upset. He holds so much anger that he doesn’t even understand. He sees this as almost David vs. Goliath. He might not even play him. But if he does. If he wins. It will be great. If he loses it will be terrible for his soul. His memory. I know part of it is avenging all the horrible things he remembers that happens. To him it’s killing the demon that destroyed his mother. 

He is not responsible for the choices I made or he made. This isn’t is fight. He’s determined to make it. He’s been itching to play him since he got good at it. I know this. 

I don’t know if I should let this go. I am passed the point of not letting him play. He funds his own tournaments. I know I still have pull with the league commissioner. I just don’t know if it’s right. 

I guess. I’m sorry for the wall of text. I don’t know how to deal with the defeat if he loses. Especially against my ex. I also don’t know how to deal with the win. None of this is his fight. But I think even though he was young. He sees this as though he it’s against him too.

I wanted to thank you all for your contributions. But I had forgotten to add some more details I thought could help contribute to better advice. These are mostly things my son (m17) has noticed with her, and the following comes directly from him:
~~~~~~
She’s setting standards for herself that she can’t achieve with her current work ethic. 

Again, its like she wants greatness, but without the work that needs to be put in along the way. 

Also, her ego and stubbornness has prevented her from understanding the repercussions of what she is doing. She refuses any help that comes her way, and would rather struggle and eventually give up on her work herself than accept help.
From my time in high school, helping my sister and having taken some of the classes she is in (all of which are wonderful teachers who would stop the class to help her out), my sister is someone who, once she has the help she needs, does not pay attention to anything that her teacher is saying. Even after stopping to repeat or explain topics differently, she feels patronized, and that me or my mom are making her feel “stupid”, and she eventually walks out of the room and continues to do everything herself. 

Sometimes, when she doesn’t understand something, or when she gets frustrated, she won’t ask us questions, just feign understanding so we leave her room. 

I believe that her phone is the problem.  As someone who was (and still is) addicted to their phone, it definitely has an impact on schoolwork. She IS addicted, as she inflicted violence on my mother after her phone was taken away recently, and made a numerous amount of threats. I have noticed my sister skipping classes to go on her phone. This was something my mother failed to mention in the original post. 

Honestly, my Mom is falling into a depressed state, with everything so far having failed to impact my sisters grades. She is a lot more stressed out, and is putting all of her focus into my sister, leaving me to help my youngest brother (9m).

So far, it’s been a lot harder than I expected. Specifically, any time I give him feedback, he says he feels like I’m invalidating his whole being.

My parents and I all spend a significant amount of time doing things for him daily, and we rarely say no to his requests for help. Meanwhile, he almost never does anything for us. (Is it unfair to expect him to?) Lately, he likes to lock himself in his room all day and yell at us if we try to check on him.

Today, my mom asked him to help her on a major career-related project she has coming up. It’s a significant time commitment, so he responds with a slew of arguments about how busy he is and how she should do it on her own. I tell him he is selfish because he never wants to help others, and he says that just giving his point of view isn’t selfishness. I tell him he’s always defensive whenever I point out his faults.

Later, he accuses me of always making claims about him that are untrue, such as selfishness and defensiveness. But to me, he has shown a long history of both of these behaviors, always beginning sentences with “I” and always responding to criticism with “no, I’m not.” 

Additionally, he only does things that he set out to do, and nothing else. I gave him a book two months ago, and he still hasn’t finished it. I asked him to just try spending a single day without screen time, a month ago.

I wanted to thank you all for your contributions. But I had forgotten to add some more details I thought could help contribute to better advice. These are mostly things my son (m17) has noticed with her, and the following comes directly from him:
~~~~~~
She’s setting standards for herself that she can’t achieve with her current work ethic. 

Again, its like she wants greatness, but without the work that needs to be put in along the way. 

Also, her ego and stubbornness has prevented her from understanding the repercussions of what she is doing. She refuses any help that comes her way, and would rather struggle and eventually give up on her work herself than accept help.
From my time in high school, helping my sister and having taken some of the classes she is in (all of which are wonderful teachers who would stop the class to help her out), my sister is someone who, once she has the help she needs, does not pay attention to anything that her teacher is saying. Even after stopping to repeat or explain topics differently, she feels patronized, and that me or my mom are making her feel “stupid”, and she eventually walks out of the room and continues to do everything herself. 

Sometimes, when she doesn’t understand something, or when she gets frustrated, she won’t ask us questions, just feign understanding so we leave her room. 

I believe that her phone is the problem.  As someone who was (and still is) addicted to their phone, it definitely has an impact on schoolwork. She IS addicted, as she inflicted violence on my mother after her phone was taken away recently, and made a numerous amount of threats. I have noticed my sister skipping classes to go on her phone. This was something my mother failed to mention in the original post. 

Honestly, my Mom is falling into a depressed state, with everything so far having failed to impact my sisters grades. She is a lot more stressed out, and is putting all of her focus into my sister, leaving me to help my youngest brother (9m).

My daughter (15f) has been flunking the school year already, starting it off with a few Fs. She’s had problems with school and her grades before, but whenever I confronted her, she would explode at me and get violent. Last year, I attributed her low grades to burnout and tough classes. However, this year she has all regular classes, and already failing them a few weeks into sophomore year. The thing is, she is failing the classes because she is not turning in any work for them. 

I already have a few ideas as to why she isn’t even trying to do work anymore. She spends loads of time on her phone, texting people. But whenever I ask her about who she’s texting, she yells at me. Her phone seems like it’s getting in the way of schoolwork. 

In the past, she’s had an excellent work ethic, but now, she has no motivation whatsoever. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it so many times, but she blames it on stuff like her school laptop not working (my son(17m) has volunteered my help to her many times to fix these problems, but she yells at him to get out of her room), or her not understanding stuff (Whenever she says this, I always volunteer to help her, but she gets even more angry with me and says just to leave her alone). Personally, her behavior has gotten me to believe she is hiding something from me.

She does have depression, for which she is being medicated, and she has gotten better with aspects of her life.

He has money and anytime me or his mom tell him to get a reliable car, he argues and throws a damn fit about how they look or what he wants or its his money etc. I've told him repeatedly I'm tired of being his chouffer to every place he needs to go. I'm not going to wake up at 6AM to take him to his program, then pick him up and take him to school then go back and get him 5 days a week. What's happening now is already seriously affecting my ability to make money...I work for myself and all my time is devoted to him and it's frustrating.

This is met with ""you won't have to I'll just quit the program"" he says that because he doesn't think we'd actually let him do that or he'll be passive aggressive for 6 months telling us we ruined his future.

Where we live there's tons of water around and obviously, it's a necessary skill.

All my kids progressed wonderfully but when my daughter was seven years old, already a competent swimmer at the time, she was swimming into the deepest part of the lake when another swimmer, a twelve-year-old boy who was just learning how to swim for the first time, started drowning in the middle of the lake. In panic he grabbed onto her and she was shoved in. Both kids started drowning, way out in the lake. The boy had had a life belt on but I think in his panic he took it off so he could hold onto it and float but it popped out of his hands and floated away. 

I wasn't there at the time and the shorter part of the lake was only about a hundred feet across so she swam across a lot. They were alone in the lake and they were both falling underwater. The boy's dad noticed first that he couldn't see his kid, at this point they had already been struggling for a few minutes. He dove in and he went looking for them, he managed to grab them both and he took them to shore. Both had to be resuscitated. '

Ever since then, my daughter refused to touch water. There was a time where she'd have panic attacks in the shower and bath and even washing her hair. We took her to therapy and she improved to the point where she was able to bathe comfortably again but she was still absolutely terrified of the water. She's been to a collection of different therapists but she still has a severe fear of water and refuses to go anywhere near it. 

She recently just turned sixteen and finally was coaxed into her grandfather's backyard pool a few months ago. She stayed in the shallow end and tried to swim but she's lost the ability and wasn't able to even float. The therapist had been making a little headway in getting her back into the water but now she says if she can't swim, there's no point in ever going back to the water. Somehow, even though the fear was subsiding, it's come back a lot harder and now she's back to never touching the water.

I'm really out of options here. We've tried therapy, counselling, gradually easing her into water but none of it works. Last year we had to cancel our Disney cruise because she vehemently refused to go on a ship in the middle of the ocean. She said we were free to go ourselves but of course I'm not going to leave her on her own while the rest of the family has fun.

I just don't think it's safe, especially considering we live around so much water.

I’m going to try to make this short and to the point. 

Backstory: My BF and I have been together 6 years and lived together pretty much entire 6 years. He has full custody of SD13 and SS12. His mom also lives with us. She speaks no English and I speak very little Spanish. His mom and him are from another country and have been in the US for around 20 years. We also have custody of BFs nephew who is 13. His mom is fighting cancer and just started chemo this week. Bio mom is out of the picture for the most part. She comes around once in a while but usually stays away because her priority is drugs. 

His mom calls him today crying because SD and nephew got into a fight and SD threw a bottle of lotion at nephew and missed and it hit his mom. This poor woman is fighting for her life and SD can’t respect her and leave her the hell alone to rest. 
So BF gets home from work tells me what happened and yells at SD and tells her no electronics. SD was running m her mouth saying she was gonna call the cops if he touched her and was talking shit to BF. BF NEVER hits his kids and never really punishes them. 

Fast forward to right now (10pm) and BF is sleeping because he has to get up at 4am. I go into the kitchen and she’s sitting there playing on BFs laptop. I tell her to give it to me and she runs into his moms room talking crap to his mom and jumps into bed with her. Since I don’t want to bother his mom and she doesn’t want to listen to me fight with SD I just leave her room. SD knows his mom is sick and needs to rest but is such a brat she doesn’t care. I am so disappointed and disgusted with her. 

SD is selfish and disrespectful. I am disgusted with the way she acts and BF is too. I’m soooo mad and now have soooo much anxiety I can’t sleep. I want to wake BF up and tell him but am going to wait until morning. 

Is it bad that I wish bio mom would get her life together and take this damn kid. My life and everyone else’s would be so much calmer if she weren’t here.

Hi, so I have two daughters. A 17 and a 19 year old. I am a nurse and I work long 12 hour shifts. Since the pandemic started I’ve been having to work sometimes up to 6 days a week. My daughters both have been constantly at home since March. Neither of them have jobs (lots of unemployment here so places can pick and choose) but they are both going to school online currently. They both have their licenses and there is a car that they share that’s always available. I’m not sure if this matters but - The 19 year old is bipolar and has anxiety and the 17 year old has High functioning autism. Both do go to therapy online. And the 19 year old is on medication. 

Here’s the problem : I give them money to go buy food, they refuse to go to the grocery store to get themselves food. They both HATE driving. They both have a massive fear of driving. We live in a rural area so to get anywhere you need to drive. There is no public transportation. Also, I bought the 17 year old new glasses and they have been ready for over a month, she still hasn’t went and picked them up. The dogs and cats are out of hard food and they can’t be bothered to go to pet smart so they are just feeding them food they find in the refrigerator. I mean this is just getting ridiculous. There is no reason they can’t go get food for themselves, pick up cat/dog food and pick up your prescription glasses. They have more free time than I do. 

The last thing I want to hear when I come home from a long day at work is them whining that there is nothing to eat (there is food here just nothing they like), I only go to the store on my day off and if they refuse to tell me what they want or go with me then I just buy random food and either they eat it or don’t. 

I’ve had enough of it and I told them last night “you guys are 17 and 19 years old, if you don’t like what’s here to eat, then get in your car and go to the grocery store or make a list and I’ll go when I have the time. I don’t want to hear anymore whining about how there’s no food here when that could be solved if you went to the store and got food. You can’t use your anxiety as an excuse for everything. I work long hours and don’t have time to deal with this. I barely get a day off as is. There are people who have it way worse than you two, that have no choice but to fend for themselves. Also, *17 year olds name* why haven’t you picked up your glasses yet? The place is literally 10 minutes away. The place is not open when I go into work or come home from work so I can’t get them for you. I paid good money for those glasses, I suggest you go pick them up this week. This is just ridiculous. You guys are here all the time and rely on me to do everything for you. I don’t have time to do that. I am at work constantly.

meanwhile my brother was born playing video games and rarely went/goes out(this is partly because it is no longer considered safe to send kids alone outside)
he has no sense of self awareness, like not sharing every personal info to a stranger. or like thinking on the fly, if a shop is closed he would return home instead of trying to find a different shop.

My husband and I have 4 kids, 2 girls are his from previous marriage who are 19 and 13, and 2 boys from this marriage who are 4 and 1 ½. The girls stay with us some weekends, or whenever they feel like it, which sometimes has meant we have not seen them for weeks before they decide to come. 

Our house has 3 bedrooms, a studio, and a converted garage where we have a play room, the laundry and also some storage. The girls each have their room and the boys have been sleeping with us in our room. Even though each girl has their own room with their respective dresser and bed, side table, etc., they sleep together in one bed every night they stay here. They really enjoy each other’s company which is great for them. 

Since they sleep together anyway, and they don’t stay here full time or even half-time, husband and I decided early last year that it was time for the boys to have their own room and the girls could move together into the bigger room. They both got emotional and husband said let’s leave it alone, the boys are still so little.

So again this year, before the pandemic hit, we asked the 19 year old if we could move the boys into her room since she’s moving to college (from Florida to Boston) and she’s going to be there for about 7-8 years at least, and she again cried for days, said we were trying to get rid of her, that she was here first and it was her room, and her dad said ok fine your room stays the same. She ended up moving back home this year because her dorm closed, but she’s moving back to Boston this week as they have now opened.

We revisited the subject again last week, and she now agreed that she and her sister could share the big room so that the boys could have their own room. This bigger room fits both girls’ dressers and it works perfectly because younger sister will have her ‘own’ room while the other is a college, and when oldest comes home, she will have all her things there as if she never left. When she comes home for holidays and breaks she said she could sleep with her sister. Everything so far sounds great right? Ok, here’s the big issue now. After moving the 13 year old’s dresser into her sister’s room, she is now crying and crying because she wants to have her room stay the same and not have to move in with her sister. She is very upset and is saying things like, ‘It’s not my problem that you decided to have more kids’, ‘turn the studio into a room and put them there’, ‘why do I have to suffer for your actions’, etc. She is also not talking to her dad because ‘she can’t forgive him for what he has done to her’.

My husband is now telling me that he doesn’t know what to do and is thinking about putting her dresser back. The boys could move into the bigger room but there is a big dresser, side table in there full of 19 year old’s things that doesn’t fit into the smaller room, so we would either have to keep all her things in the boys room or end up converting the studio into a bedroom, just to hold her things. 

I am telling my husband that we already made a decision, that he cannot keep holding this off just because they object and get upset. She will be upset for a week maybe and then she will be fine. That we should offer her emotional support but not give in because we would then be reinforcing this sort of selfish behavior. I told him the same thing when the oldest also refused to give up the room for her brothers the first time. He doesn’t agree, he thinks that she is a very sensitive child and he has to cater to her emotional needs. However, I don’t think this is a ‘need’, I think it’s a tantrum. I mean she is basically going to have a big room to herself and she barely comes here anyway! During the last semester her sister was away at college, she stayed here one weekend and we didn’t see her again till her sister moved back home. Why should our 2 boys who are here full-time have to share a room with us? My husband says I’m insensitive and I’m like this because I’m not her mom, but I feel like giving in to an illogical, purely emotional demand would actually be a disservice to her. Am I wrong?

My daughter got her first-period last month, and if my predictions are correct her next cycle is coming up soon. I'm seeking some tips and insight on how I can help my daughter through her first few periods. 

A little history: After losing my wife, I sought out advice from my mother and also some online resources on being a single dad. I had stocked up the so-called essentials, as well as tampons, pads, and two sizes of menstrual cups - This would prove to be my first mistake. Having all those choices in front of her would ultimately cause a lot of confusion which I could not help at all. Eventually, she settled on sanitary pads but noted it was very weird. I encouraged her to talk to her classmates about their preference, and promised I would research into what was better. 

I had the talk with her after this, answering all her questions about what and why. I was satisfied with myself. 

I bought her a Nintendo console she always wanted and had a pizza party to celebrate my little girl becoming a little lady! Hopefully, this didn't come across as being too freaky over the situation.

So, Reddit, could you kindly tell me what I could do to help her situation? Do I need to make any changes around the house, do I need to behave in a certain way during her period?

I am very grateful for any advice you may have for me since I don't have any sisters(or even cousins) to talk to about this.

My heart goes out to the families who don’t have the luxury of asking questions like this and I truly don’t want to be insensitive.

Here goes: 
I’m a single mom to a 15 year old boy, W. We live in a two bedroom, smallish apartment in Florida. W has a history of relatively serious asthma and bronchitis that he’s mostly outgrown. But here in Florida, the Covid numbers are so high that I’m terrified to send him to school with 3000 other kids who don’t wash their hands and physically distance themselves

I’ve been working from home since March and today is the third day of school. All the fun newness of school has worn off and the realization that we’re going to be doing this for the foreseeable future is sinking in. 

I have ADHD and W has a little depression and anxiety already. I know this isn’t an ideal situation for anybody, but I feel like it’s taking a little harder toll on us. 

I’ve heard of these neighborhood “pod” schools that are like mini-schools for neighborhood kids, but I don’t know how that would work for high school. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to create a better physical and social environment for W? 

TLDR: Two hormonal mouthy people living, working, schooling in the same tiny apartment day after day need some advice please. :)

What time do you guys enforce bedtime for your early teenagers?
I’m the step-parent of a great 13-yo girl. For her last term in 7th grade she was in distance learning classes due to Covid, and still kept her grades up and achieved the Honor Roll. Proud of her. Heading into 8th grade distance learning in a couple of weeks. She was allowed to stay up pretty late this summer and wakes up between 11am-1pm, which I have to admit irritates me, but I figure, it’s summer and she really doesn’t have much reason to get up early. She does admit she can’t wake up early because she stays up watching TV or playing games. We didn’t regulate her internet access before this summer started. She has a TV in her room and has a smartphone device, both of which she uses often throughout the day. Currently I have her internet access  scheduled to be turned off at midnight on weekdays. 

Her online classes begin in two weeks and she’ll be logging in at 8:30 am. Seems a good idea to have her start going to bed at a decent time so she can get up in time to feed herself and do whatever she needs to prepare to log in to her video classes. I am thinking of shutting her internet off at 9pm with bedtime at 10.

He seemed fine when we got home but a little cagey so we started looking around. We found a small, empty bottle of wine in the recycling outside that he had drunk while we were gone. We had accidentally left it out of the cabinet when we put the locks on it (it was in the garage. We were going to toss it in the trash and just forgot about it.) We also discovered that he had found his phone and texted his friends. 

I am not sure what to do next. Every time he has done this, he has texted his friends and posted on social media that he is drinking. It seems as though he is trying to be cool or something. 

We have also started homeschooling all 4 of our kids permanently because they were not going to be successful in a distance learning environment. He failed every class his freshman year of high school as well. His high school counselor said that his was the worst case of ADHD the high school had ever encountered.

What do we do now? I am at a loss. My husband and I both work full time. My husband works from home and I am an ER nurse so I go in 3 days a week for 12 hour shifts. I have told him, and all of our kids, generalized stories from work of what can happen when they make dumb decisions but that doesn’t seem to be helping at all.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2607835,public,self,My 15 year old has been drinking,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/if85qa/my_15_year_old_has_been_drinking/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

Divorced from their dad for 5 years. We are both remarried. They all get along fine with both step parents (meaning that there are no arguments or problems). Ex and I have a cordial/friendly relationship. No issues with each other's spouses. We have 50/50 custody.

My daughter has always been difficult. When she was a toddler she was the one who screamed all the way thru the grocery store. Growing up she was the one who always acted up at the dinner table and was sent to her room kicking and screaming. For the past 3 years now she's been absolutely miserable. Talking back and giving me attitude, being mean to her brothers, etc. Last year I took her to a psychologist and she refused to talk. At all. It was awful. 

Then a few months before COVID I thought it was getting a little bit better.  She would ask me to watch movies and would kind of ""hang around"" me and talk to me a lot more. But then COVID struck and since then she's been back to her old self, but even WORSE.

She's always angry. She swears all the time. She tells her brothers to ""fuck off"" and has recently started saying things like this to me. She refuses to do anything that I ask of her. I've tried taking away privileges like her phone, her laptop, etc, but it doesn't help. I've tried and tried to talk to her. I've asked her why she's so angry. I've asked her what I could do to help her. I get no where. 

Her brothers tell me that she acts the same way at her dad's house, but when I ask him about it he says ""she doesn't act that way with me"". 🙄 He's very passive. He tells me that he'll talk to her about it and tell her to stop, however, he won't back me up on any punishments I try to enforce. So whatever consequence I try to put in place, it gets undone when she goes to his house. The other day she once again told me to ""get the fuck out of her room"". I texted him and told him about it and asked if we could come up with some punishment that would apply in both households, because even if she doesn't act that way with him (like he claims), does he really want his daughter to be the type of person who's so disrespectful to ANY adult? He just now responded and said no to a joint-punishment. He said that he ""discussed it with her and she knows it's wrong to talk that way"" and that she ""was just tired"". He suggested that next time I ""calmly correct her"". 🙄 He also told me that I shouldn't continue to take stuff away from her because ""that's just going to piss her off even more"".

OMG! She is not 3 years old. She shouldn't need to be ""calmly corrected"". She ADMITTED that she knew it was wrong, so what's the point in correcting her anyway? And tired or not, that's no excuse for talking to your mother (or anyone) that way. I told him that I don't care if I piss her off because we're her parents and not her friends. 

If we all lived in the same house I wouldn't hesitate to be a hard ass and punish her however I saw fit. But since we're divorced, I try to hold off because I have such a big fear that she's just going to then ask to live at her dad's house full time and he'd allow it. And as mean and nasty as she is, that would break my heart. And it would break her twin brother's heart because he's always been so loving with her (even though she treats him like crap too)! And as irrational as I know this is, now that he's remarried I have the worry that his wife would just replace me in her eyes. 

I am not a perfect parent, but all in all I'm pretty easy. I don't ask a lot of them and I get them whatever they want and/or allow them to do anything they want, within reason. I am available when they need me. I encourage them to talk to me about anything and I don't judge. I've always been very loving and affectionate. All three of them are on honor roll. I have to add that I have absolutely NO issues with my boys. They are both sweet as can be. So I've obviously done something right?

His father has every other weekend visitation which he has not always utilized.  He married his wife a few years ago and started spending more time with our son recently.  

Last week, my son wanted us to go shopping before school started for new things. I didn't think it was necessary as we have an abundance of brand new notebooks, pens, paper, note cards, highlighters, binders etc at home.  The only supplies ever needed on the first day are a pen and paper.  Class specific lists are given in class on the first day.  I buy whatever else is needed off of the lists the next few days after we receive them. No need to go buy things that we don't know if he will need or not is always my thinking.  

I had been out for the weekend and after a long drive, I laid down to take a nap. I opened my iPad after my nap to discover that my son had used it to chat with his step-mom. This is where I'm asking for advice.  I don't want to make a big deal or start a conversation with her about it for nothing. 

Step mom - ""Did your mom take you shopping for school supplies?""

Son - ""Nope, she didn't.""

Step mom - ""So, do you have a backpack? Paper? Anything?""

Son - ""I have a backpack. My mom said we have everything I need and I will be fine.""

Step mom - ""We just paid support on Friday. She must be using it for other things.  Is she home now?""

Son - ""Yeah but she's asleep.""

Step mom - ""I'm concerned she's sleeping when she could be taking you school shopping. Did you at least get new shoes""

Son - ""Yes.""

Perhaps my son has voiced some sort of worry to her about lack of supplies, and I appreciate her concern.  I don't feel it necessary or appropriate for her to tell him that she is concerned with my actions or to discuss finances with him.  It has always been a back and forth when he gets in trouble because his father doesn't carry punishments or consequences over to his home.  For example, my son had gotten grounded from his cell phone.  It made him upset so he called his dad to come get him, and his dad got him a new phone.  I only have a few years left of having to really communicate with his dad and I don't want to rock the boat if I'm overreacting.

Throughout this year I’ve noticed he’s been ordering books such as “state and revolution, the conquest of bread, and quotations from Mao Tse-Tung” 
I didn’t think much of this because he’s always purchased things like the unabomber manifesto, so I assumed it was just curiosity but after looking further into what he’s been doing online I found out he runs a political page with the following bio (this was linked to his Instagram account) - 

- ☭ Marxism-Leninism-Maoism ☭
   🚩Cultural Revolution 
   🚩Mass Line 
   🚩Internationalism 
   🚩Peoples War 

I was really concerned about this and after thinking about it for a while I tried to have a discussion with him but it didn’t lead anywhere.
He obviously knows more about this than me and I wasn’t able to convince him on anything. 
He has a lot of essays on that page and I would need someone more educated on these issues to get through to him.

Everyone (except her father who seems to be abdicating any adult authority) thinks she’s badly addicted to social media. Not that there’s not other things going on but she has an intense need to be popular. And that constant dopamine hit from her phone and the lack of daily structure during “quarantine” is pointing her life in a dangerous direction.

We took her phone away from her at which point she rummaged around for it and took it. After a couple of hours of back and forth she gave it back... and the proceeded to try to get it back again.

Frankly everything I heard from her sounds exactly like addict talk. “I don’t need it. I want it.” “I can put it down whenever I want.” She bargains, she blames, she threatens.

We are getting him into a community college type of thing that we have in our country (a 1st world western, not America) so he can obtain certifications for University. My mother is worried something is wrong. My brother is a recluse and rarely comes outside of his room, we have to knock 5+ times to speak to him or let him know food is ready etc. We can go a whole week without seeing or speaking to him. If we try to get serious and talk to him he just shuts his door, yells at us or ignores us completely. My mother has never really punished him but there's nothing to punish him with since he doesn't have friends and stays inside all the time. We can take his computer away but that's basically it. Why haven't I done anything? Well I'm 22 and can't do anything since I'm not his father and every bit of help elicits that response. Not sure what we should be doing. We can get him to therapy but how do we get him there if he just says no and locks himself in his room. We had to struggle to get him to take a professional photo for his passport. For reference he's the third child, I'm the first and our sister is the middle. My sister and myself are in University. We think something bad might have happened at High School since he stopped going to suddenly and refused to go back to submit his enrolment form. I had to do it. Advice would be great! My personal worry and maybe my mum shares this as well. I had people in High School commit suicide when I went there and also a few friends that became ""drop kicks"" and didn't move forward in life. We've never forced anything onto him, my mum is very open and lets us make our decisions as long as we're working or studying.

Since the pandemic began, he is now of course around 24/7 since school was virtual from home and his part time job has closed down due to Covid.  It had just been decided that for at least the first marking period of the new school year will be virtual as well and I doubt he will have football practice either.  Keeping up with his schooling is a nightmare because I literally have to stand over his shoulder and check everything since he lies about everything and will tell you he has done his homework - knowing full well he has not - and high schoolers have a lot of homework! 

He’s is messy and dirty, I have to remind him multiple times every single day to shower, brush his teeth, wash his face and wear deodorant - and to actually use soap and a loofah when he showers! 

All he cares about is Xbox and the only time he ever says more than two words it’s to drone on and on about stuff from whatever game he is into at the time.  I have to limit his game time to 2 hours and then take away his remotes - otherwise if allowed he would literally lay in bed and play nonstop from the time he wakes up to the wee hour of the night.  He often tries to sneak them back when he thinks we aren’t paying attention or going out for an errand.  

His other obsession is his phone - which I have found loads of very sick and disturbing anime porn downloaded on multiple times.  Call me a prude, and I know people will tell me “it’s a boy thing” but the stuff is seriously gross and well, disturbing.  We have had to activate parental controls on the phone because he just won’t listen when told to stay away from inappropriate sites/apps and I worry about him having a very unhealthy habit/addiction.  

If he gets grounded from his electronics he just lingers around me moping and moody hoping I’ll feel sorry for him and unground him. He is also only very really nice when he wants something, otherwise he is very rude and disrespectful. He steals from my room and my purse all the time.  

I can’t watch movies or tv with him because he literally sits and narrates/talks through the ENTIRE movie, and the pulls up YouTube clips of it and tells you what’s going to happen before it happens.

His room is gross and he leaves wrappers garbage everywhere.  He has been told not to eat in his room- a rule he constantly defies.  He has had mice in his room as a result and I found a dead mouse once- that he apparently knew was there - but didn’t bother dealing with.  🤢 I had to get a cat and move the cat into his room to get rid of the problem.  

Then, getting him to eat a normal balanced healthy diet is like pulling teeth.  He will sit there at the dinner table with the same spoonful of vegetables in his mouth for like 30 minutes - like a child.  And has been caught multiple times trying to low-key spit them out in a napkin while pretending to sneeze or spit them in the garbage or toilet.  I mean seriously.  It’s frustrating because I literally can’t leave the table until I’m sure he is done eating and swallowing otherwise he would eat nothing but bread and meat. (And candy of course)

I feel like I have to spend more time monitoring, correcting and micromanaging him than I do for my other two, much younger, children.

I love him of course as he is my son, and overall not a terrible person - other people always tell me what a good kid he is (when not at home) so that a good thing.  But, I am really dreading being stuck with him 24/7 for another school year and can’t wait until this is all over and he goes back to being gone at school/ practice and work most of the time.  ***Sigh.

Today, when I got home from work, she had left a plate with writing on it on the table, so I read it. It was out in the open with no attempt at it being in a private place - ie her desk or her room. 

In it she talked about sending nudes to boys, wanting to be able to “vibe” with someone and how much she misses her dad (they’re estranged). 

It came up later in the evening and I told her I’d read what she wrote and now she’s accusing me of violating her privacy, failing a “test” and reaffirming her earlier accusations that she hates me, doesn’t respect me and that I am a person of “low moral values.” 

Things are difficult in general with her as she figures out who she is, but truly, I am most concerned about her health, safety and well being. I am responsible for her, after all. 

I give her wide latitude in her online life - she has Instagram and snap chat despite my better judgement and full access to her phone at pretty much all hours. 

I am a single working parent with zero help from her dad and doing my best to navigate these waters. I was molested by my father and my mom was complicit in it so I have no idea what I’m doing here bc I know my childhood wasn’t “normal” and unfortunately, neither is my daughter’s bc I didn’t get any therapy before I hooked up with her dad and of course, he’s basically the narcissist without pedophilia that my own dad was. 

I’m not above apologizing if I’ve mis-stepped here but I have zero perspective and am triggered deeply by so much of what she says about how I’m worthless and a horrible mom when I work so hard to be a good, kind and loving parent.

Doctor said that was normal. Around a year old, he had still not hit the developmental milestone of pointing to something he wanted. A lot of times he would ignore me when I called his name. Doctor still said normal. 

He didn’t really babble like other babies do, and spoke late. He started really talking around 2 and a half, and suddenly had an impressive vocabulary at 3. Doctor said that is common in boys. 

This kid had no sense of fear or danger. He would often wander off and not notice or care that I wasn’t there. I’d be frantically searching for him, only to find him looking at something or happily chatting with an adult somewhere. 

He was very focused on certain things. When he was 2, he loved toy cars. He would push them slowly around on different surfaces and intently watch the wheels spin.

When he was 3, he became obsessed with Blue’s Clues. He’d watch the same episodes over and over, and later would walk around the house reciting them word for word. I made him a little “handy dandy notebook” and he would go around writing the “clues” in his notebook. He didn’t really make up stories with his toys but would use them to reenact scenes from his favorite shows. 

When he was 4, we put him in a co-op preschool. On the days I was in the classroom, I’d notice that he never interacted with the other children. Sometimes a child would ask him to join them, and he’d say “no, thanks,” and continue to do what he was doing. The teacher said some kids are just like that. 

He was a young 4, so we decided to have him repeat preschool when he was 5. He finally bonded with another child, one who was equally obsessed with Buzz Lightyear (his current interest at the time). I was so excited that he finally had a friend for once! I became friends with the child’s mom and we had regular play dates for the kids. 

In elementary school, my son did have a few friends (unfortunately his preschool friend didn’t go to his school) but he always was the leader and organizer of the play. Up until 4th grade, he’d bring his Pokémon stat book to school, and he and his friends would talk about which Pokémon they wanted to “be” and then have an imaginary “battle” with my son as the judge as to who won. He had that entire book of 600+ Pokémon memorized, along with their height, weight, and abilities, and even at home, he loved to talk about who would beat who. 

Unfortunately in 5th grade, his friends grew out of their interest in Pokémon while my son remained obsessed. When I’d ask what he did at recess, he’d say he sat and “meditated.” At home, it was hard to talk with him about things like how his day went, or how he felt about things. He spent a lot of time in his room reading or “thinking.” I’d often overhear him talking to himself about Pokémon and making battle sound effects. When he did make his appearance, he would talk and talk about Pokémon or whatever else he was into. It was difficult to have a meaningful two-way conversation with him about anything. 

He’s 15 now and has a good little group of friends in school who are also into fantasy and D&amp;D (his current interest). However, now that school is virtual, he makes little to no effort in contacting them. He’s not interested at all in social media or texting a friend just to chat. We did have a couple of his friends come to our house on his birthday over the summer, and he seemed to have a genuinely good time with them, but he never asks to have anyone over. I think he’s mostly just happy in his own little world with his books and his imagination. 

He’s an incredibly sweet boy who is very cooperative and easy. He loves his routine and does all his chores and schoolwork without us having to remind him. The only time he really gets upset is if we change his routine without prior notice, or if his little brother is in his space without his consent. His room is impeccable, with every single item having a place. He’s always been like this; my sister laughs about a time she babysat him when he was around 2 or 3, and when she was helping him clean up his toys, he corrected her and showed her the “right” way to do it. He has a very calm demeanor, and will teach his younger brother how to do things in a very patient and informative way. I call him The Professor sometimes because he uses a very formal speech pattern and big words. 

Throughout his life, I have often wondered if he is on the autism spectrum. He just ticks off so many boxes. I have asked his pediatricians and all his teachers, and they assure me that he is “quirky” but “normal”. However, I have had many people in my family and social circle who also have mentioned that they think he could be autistic. I guess in a way it doesn’t even matter? 

I love him the way he is, and I think that he has a lot of amazing characteristics. He doesn’t seem to really notice or care when someone is teasing him; it seems like everything just kind of rolls off his back. He has a great sense of what he likes and wants, and he doesn’t care what anyone else thinks about it. He is always very motivated to learn more about things that he is interested in. He was tested for GATE in 3rd grade, and ranked very highly. So he has been in accelerated classes since then. He especially excels in math and I could see him easily getting a job in engineering or computers after college. 

Sometimes though, I just want to know. I’ve thought about ignoring what the doctors say and just taking him somewhere to get tested, but I don’t really want to make it a big deal. I’ve never mentioned my suspicions to him either, I only discuss it with people when he is not around.

It was a constant struggle every day to get her into school, but I still had to deal with truancy. Once she got into the 9th grade, it was 10x worse, so I signed her out.

 I got her into home school and counseling, but she didn't want either one. I'm trying to help her get a general education certificate.

we cannot reach out to our parents, as our father is a raging alcoholic and our mom is just ... well the lights are on but no ones home... 

 the other day she hitched-hiked home (45min-1hr) in the back of two adult mens truck. She was telling me how good it made her feel when these men were telling her how hot she is, especially when they told her that she’s gonna be “banging” when she’s older .. this makes make sick! and shows how bad she’s truly feeling about herself 

I remember when i was diagnosed with crohn’s and RA at her age, it added to my feelings of worthlessness and self hatred... and having an abusive alcohol father definitely didn’t help!

she also in college completing her program in a Pandemic!

(She only knows about it because she saw mom's screen over her shoulder)
The app tracks her location and gives them access to her apps, text messages, calls, search history, and sets time limits. This is a serious violation of human rights and I need to help her get that privacy back.

Some of you may have a number of arguments for the app, so I'll address them:
1. My sister bought this phone with her own money and pays her own phone bill. Our parents didn't help her in the slightest, other than to set it up in the first place. It's hers, not theirs. 
2. She doesn't go anywhere alone. She's doing online school, doesn't hang out with friends outside of our parents' home, and only goes places with trusted family. She even works with our brother (22) during his shifts. A location tracker is useless to her.
3. She doesn't have any interest in porn or a significant other, so the app is useless if they're trying to monitor her for that.
4. Her most common uses for her phone are a) to text her siblings (including myself) memes and jokes, b) help her friends through PRIVATE mental health issues, and to c) look up things during bible study. (Oh my goodness! What evil things could she look up in order to understand a bible verse more? Gasp.)
5. She will be a legal adult in 2 months. She's a good girl and is more of a responsible adult than I am.

My question is how can I help her? She already has depression and anxiety due to past issues and this is just going to make it so she won't trust anyone. Including the people who are supposed to make her feel safe.

(Also, I know several people who had this kind of app as a teenager and were later in abusive relationships because ""it's normal for people who love you to spy on you!"" and it scares me to think she'll do the same at some point)",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2557269,public,self,My parents took away my sister's privacy and I want to get it back for her,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/i8rl82/my_parents_took_away_my_sisters_privacy_and_i/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

He’s not overweight, but has gained a good bit since he turned 11 and is embarrassed of the way he looks. 

His mother and I have him play soccer just about year-round, but he puts very little effort in when playing or practicing.

We bought him a Fitbit and have him get 10,000 steps in a day and have tried different rewards for getting the goal. The rewards don’t work and he’s fine sitting around and not getting his steps. So, we tell him if he doesn’t get his goal, he has to make up steps the next day before he can get electronic time. That didn’t work out because he just didn’t have electronics and was miserable. His complaint was that it took all day.

We gave him more options... If he came to the gym with us for an hour, that can count as his daily steps. The days he practices/plays soccer and puts in effort, that can count for his steps.

So, now he doesn’t try for his step goal, he wants to go to the gym with us, but puts in the minimal amount of effort, but he has started trying more in soccer. On days we go to the gym, he sits around and doesn’t do anything because he knows it’ll be extra effort than he’s required. He got frustrated that today was a gym day because he wanted to do something else, but doesn’t want to do more activity than is required. We tell him “You don’t HAVE to go to the gym. It’s just ONE way to be active.”

We’ve had him visiting with a child psychologist/counselor and she is not concerned about depression, but has yet to offer any guidance on how to motivate him more. However, the psychologist has been able to get him to open up more (something that was a separate concern of ours) so we don’t want to find another one.

We’re not sure how else to help motivate him. I know it’s common for teenagers to be lazy, but we feel as if this is more than just lazy. It’s complete lack of motivation.

Since I was 15 though, she’s been with me jumping from house to house. I couldn’t work an actual job at 15 and was stealing food and water for her from school and stores around town and doing side gigs every weekend to buy her clothes. Once I could work at 16, I quit school and worked full time- bought her takeout every night since we didn’t have a kitchen, always made sure she had clean and new clothes for school. 

At 18, I got my first apartment- 2 bedrooms so she could stay w me. She stayed with me until my mom demanded her back. Towards March 2019, she fought me twice- once broke every mirror and glass in my house because I caught her with a vape, and the second time almost broke my eye socket and broke all the windows. 

I limited contact with her after that, but in October 2019 she fought with my mom and mom had her leave the house to stay with me. She kept running away from me, but hadn’t hit me so I figured the sass is something I could handle. 

And now 2020- I’m renting a house. First time for 6 years that we’ve had an actual house to live in with our own rooms. I’ve bought her all brand new things to decorate with. We found two kittens that’s she’s been happy with. Our mom and brothers have been with us here as they haven’t had a good home to stay in. Yesterday, I was about to buy her an Apple laptop she’s been asking for forever, but we decided to order online so she could get a different color. 

About an hour ago she came out of her room yelling at my little brother then slammed her door. I opened the door back up and told her not to slam it- like I’ve told her for the past 3 months. She slammed it again, opened it back up, and grabbed me by hair and started hitting me. I was in so much shock that she’d even put her hands on me again. I told her to leave the house. She broke the screen door, then started throwing big rocks at all of the windows. I haven’t even gone outside yet to see the damage. My mom told her to cut it out and come back inside. I took the TV from my sisters room afraid she’d end up damaging it. She came out chased me around the house and started hitting me again. Luckily my mom pulled her off. She started throwing all of her things out of her room and down the stairs- probably all broken now. My mom said not to call the cops and that I’ll be the one getting arrested if I call- she said she can’t risk exposing herself or the littles ones to COVID if my sister is taken down to the police station. 

My little sister has been admitted to the hospital twice for suicide and been arrested previously when my eye socket was almost broken. I’ve spent the past 4 years working non stop- 6 days a week, 13 hours a day to take care of my family w 5 siblings. All I’ve asked is that everyone be respectful in my home so I don’t get kicked out and don’t set a bad name for myself amongst realty companies. I’ve asked my mom numerous times over the past 5+ years to get her a therapist because of her behavior. She refuses to because she’s scared it’ll make a bad name for herself- same reason why she won’t give me full custody of my sister so I could do make these appointments myself. 

I have nothing left to give already. I’ve wiped myself clean mentally. I’ve been giving all I’ve had over the past few years to make sure my family has a roof over their heads and food in their mouths. I’ve been doing all of the labor, the budgeting, the planning and have just asked that everyone just be respectful in return. I’ve sat down with my sister and have talked with her about the problems she’s faced and have been trying to teach her to have a conversation instead of fighting. I’ve been trying my best to do everything right and I still get attacked and ridiculed and disrespected. I’ve wanted to start my own life for so long- go traveling, go to university, meet new people. I’ve been okay with putting it all to the side if that meant I could be giving a better life to 6 of my family members. It all just seems like shit now. I just needed some place to let this out.

First, thanks for all your advice - as you will see below, I've been listening.


We met for an hour and I told him how I was probably trying to overcompensate for the limited time I had with him and it could not have been much fun.


Without bringing up his mom's family, I told him I was probably projecting my biggest fear - that he'd grow into a less-than-competent adult male, someone I'd love, but not respect. I said that I would back off on this, as he had shown no signs of heading that way.


I told him I firmly believe that our value system has helped make us the most successful immigrant community America, which was why I was trying to ingrain said values. I told him I am, of course, still the same person with the same values and expectations, but would learn to trust him to embody and live them.


I told him that I'd like to meet him to do stuff, so I'd have an opportunity to show that I was treating him as a person (vs a project) if he was up for it.


And, to appease the ""feelings"" crowd &lt;bad joke&gt;, yes, I did tell him I loved him and missed him.


We agreed to meet tomorrow for a jog with the dog and he's promised not to laugh at me gasping for breath as I try to keep up with them. He cracked a smile a couple of times during our conversation, so I am hoping that this is fixable in time.

---

As the title says, should I keep keep forcing my 16 year old niece to start waking up early in preparation for her online classes that would start on August 24?

&amp;nbsp;

Our country has been in lockdown since March and since it was summer vacation, I've been letting her wake up as late as 12 noon. Because her classes are nearing, I've been trying to get her to build a habit of waking up early so that she wouldn't have a hard time adjusting once school starts. This would be the first time she'd be having online classes. Her school will be having classes via video conferencing (Zoom) 3 days a week and it would start as early as 8 AM. The other 2 days are for self study.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been trying to make her wake up early since July but it's not working at all. 90% of the time she's still waking up very late and I'm at the point of giving up due to frustration. She's a teenager and she knows the consequences of her actions. If she has a hard time once school starts then that would be on her.

**Background**: Culturally Asian dad, now divorced for 6 years from culturally western mom. Got custody ~30% of the time as son was 8 at the time.


Ex wife's family raises strong (but incredibly overprotective) women but…how do I say this delicately…absolutely spineless men. Father in law ""retired"" in his early 50's and lives off his wife and the state. Brother in law has never held a job and lives off his wife. Kid's mom won't let him cross a street or do anything alone.


Due to my limited time with him, every minute has become a ""teaching moment"" where I would try to instill the lesson that life in the US is basically an open-book exam: arm yourself with academic prowess, a strong work ethic, the ability to think rationally and without emotion,show competence in day-to-day tasks and you have the foundations of success.

I thought my son and I had a great relationship. We'd go hiking, do yard work, walk the dog, travel abroad, watch football, cook together all the while busily giving him ""life lessons"", which he seemed to take to heart – he has straight As, does chores without grumbling and is generally a nice, pleasant kid. In retrospect, my lessons appear to have no resonated with him, something I was blissfully unaware of at the time.


I asked him several times if he wanted to change the custody arrangement to spend more time with me and he said yes, even going so far as to hug me after saying ""let's do it"". The ex-wife was having none of it, so I turned the (expensive) lawyers loose only to get a 3-page list of complaints from my son. Turns out he feels “criticized”, feels angry, and now won't even see me unsupervised. Conversations are stilted and he's dropped all his responsibilities (walking the dog, mowing the lawn, etc.) with his mother's blessing - feelings are apparently more important than responsibilities in this alternate universe.

Her mom doesn’t want one, but her dad does, and for very good reasons. She’s an only child so she would stay living with her mom because her dad doesn’t want to hurt her mom, but she’s the epitome of a daddy’s girl. She knows divorce is being talked about, and she sees how her parents are. Her dad always spends time with her, talks to her, makes an attempt to learn things she likes even when he hates them, but her mom does none of those things. She’s asked me “is it worse to have divorced parents or to know they fight all the time?” She asked me this because my bio parents are divorced. I guess my point in this post is how can I help? How do I respond? She knows the basic reasons this is happening, but I don’t want to place blame on either parent. Should I take her from the house more? Should I just let her talk and not respond?

My oldest denies that he drank any,then him and his friend go back to their room since the game is over. 

I tell my husband that he should have at least checked, or done something. That he's at that age that he's going to push limits, and our you gest just swore to see g it happen. My husband says he knows him , he's not some stranger, and he said he didn't. So he asks our oldest and he says he didn't. OK fine.

To us that means working hard, living below your means, saving some money, donating some and having some to spend. Things have gone well up until recently. My youngest (18) had earned about $7500 and was saving up for a car and for college. Right before The lock down hit, he blew virtually every penny of it and really had no idea how he was going to pay for either. We help our kids with college, expenses, car, etc. but insist that they pay a portion as well. We find that them having “skin in the game” makes them much more responsible. He was working one day a week and when the place closed, he applied for an unemployment. The government backdated his claim and sent him $12,000. Evidently, he is due for more when they sign the new deal. He was making less than $100 a week and has no interest in returning to work because he is doing better without a job than he would do with a job. Much of what we have tried to teach him has been undermined by these checks and he is presently shopping for a car and calculating how much more money the government will send him. He is living like the supply of govt. money will never end, despite our cautions. While I’m happy for him that he’s getting a car, I’m also sad for him because he has been deprived of some really important life lessons regarding finances.

I know I am not a full-on parent but my niece (13) has been living full time with my mom and I since January (her parents are going through a messy separation) even though she has spent half her life on and off with us. So I am pretty much her guardian along with my mom.

I cannot seem to build a good relationship with her. She seems to love me dearly and I love her dearly but the moment I do anything 'parent-like' she makes it in to a big deal. I noticed she gives me a particularly hard time to the point where her constant back talking and arguing has given me at least 1 minor panic attack and 1 major major major one where I screamed and blew up at her and I never recovered from this because she didn't recover from it, as it is scary to see an adult lose control like that. This was in February. I have aplogized and admitted how poorly I acted and that I, as an adult, should've had better control of my emotions. She is not over it and I understand. 

Yesterday she confessed that she gave me an intentionally hard time for years because when she was younger, she saw me yelling at my dad and she loves him (her grandpa) and wanted to make me suffer because of it. My dad is a horrible person, and it pains me that no one ever considers or remembers that I blew up at him because this piece of shit human decided he can insult me. My niece now knows how horrible my dad is as she overheard from other sources. I never told her. And I always regretted yelling at him with her within earshot and I tried for years and years to be better and to be the best I can be to her but because she hated me for saying mean things to her grandpa all those years ago, it was so frustrating. A few weeks ago she asked me if some of the horrible things she overheard from others about her grandpa was true and if I even knew about it, and I said yes (he cheated on my mom their entire married life, he used to beat her,  sabotaged her career, etc), I have never told her because a child didn't need to know those things and I encouraged her relationship with her grandpa as I know she loves him. So i guess this is why she confessed she was intentionally mean to me. It broke my heart because all these years I've tried to make it right that she saw me yelling at him and all i ended up with is a panic attack that once again traumatised her (the one in February).

After the panic attack I tried taking care of my mental health and I've done wonderfully. But no matter what i do, my niece still cannot stop thinking of me as a stupid person. She has no respect for me and has said as much. She speaks to me as if I am a kid and I can't even scold her for anything no matter how gently I do it without her being massively offended. One day I said: hun, you gotta be a little more organized with your school work (she mentioned three times in that past week: oh no, I forgot to do this.. it's due in 2 hrs, or similar). Did not go over well. 

No matter how hard I try, I always screw up and no matter what little thing I say or do, it is always a problem. I am considering not trying anymore and just leaving her alone for my mom to care for solely, due to no fault of my niece (I think she is wonderful and I love her with all my heart). She spent an hr yesterday saying all the things I do wrong to her and some of them are baffling to me like: u check in with my schoolwork and I am not used to anyone caring about me and my school work like that so leave me alone. I have always cared for her school work. I taught her to read and to count when she was little. 

I'm exhausted and I hate myself now. What do i do? I know I have done shit things like yelling at her grandpa with her in ear shot, having a panic attack, being overly harsh with her studies when she was younger (I saw no one else taking on the role and because she was already intent on being mean to me then due to her hating me for speaking harshly to her grandpa, it was a trying time for both of us), trying to discipline her when she was younger (I have given her 5 timeouts in her whole life and only when she was younger and then I just gave up, the only punishment she has ever received, and yesterday she told me how resentful she was and she spoke as if I was this mean, unfair monster who harmed her by giving her the cruel and unusual punishment of time outs - they never lasted more than 10 minutes). 

I dedicate my life to being the best aunty and guardian I can be and to know I've failed so spectacularly and miserably despite my best efforts is heartbreaking and soul crushing because this child deserves the best and I'm not it. I question every thing I say and do now.

In fact we have never actually been legally married.  But I lost my insurance and needed to get on his so we are having to legally do it finally after all these years.

We have no friends or family and are on a budget so we are getting married in an acquaintance’s garden and I’ll be wearing a $20 dress, then back home for homemade cupcakes.  We don’t even know enough people to have two witnesses so the owner of the garden is going to come sign and the officiant is bringing his fiancé as the other witness.  We have nobody taking pictures and it will be a ten minute ceremony.

Obviously this is nowhere near the wedding I always dreamed of but I’m making peace with it.  It is what it is.

Today our fourteen year old daughter showed the family a picture of her chosen outfit.  I had told the kids this wasn’t a formal affair and to be comfortable.  Her middle of the summer,  outdoors hot as balls wedding outfit of choice was a black Panic at the Disco tee shirt, skin tight Lycra miniskirt that ties up the side with grommets (borrowed from a friend) that barely covers her butt, fishnet pantyhose and a pair of my heels that are a bit tall for a kid in my opinion.  She also dyed her hair two shades of neon pink.  There are so many pieces of this outfit I am fine with.  Some of the pieces I dislike but have chosen my battles.  But all together it is simply not appropriate.  

Her eighteen year old brother begged her to “just once be thoughtful and a team player” and to choose something nicer.  His issue wasn’t the appropriateness but what he perceived to be a lack of care, thoughtfulness and consideration it seemed.  We are always battling over something and he
thinks she knew this outfit was going to be an issue.  

He’s wearing a button up and jeans.  He tends towards the goth look fairly often but chose to eschew that for the day.  Our other daughter is wearing a sundress and our other son a pair of jean shorts and a polo.

She just went nuclear on the family when I asked her to pick a different skirt.  The rest could stay I said.  That was a huge compromise for me.  She started screaming at us and then the littler siblings got upset and started crying and screaming.  Her older brother just got irritated.

I have been parenting nonstop without a break for eighteen years, including a severely ill child who has spent his life in and out of the hospital.  No honeymoon, no days off, nothing.  The past year has been horrible for me...my mother died, etc.  My daughter even made the whole family miss Christmas (that is a long long story).  It has been one trial after another.  

Ten minutes for me to be the focus is all I asked.  Not even the whole day.  Not even a night away.  

She’s in therapy and her therapist doesn’t know what to do with her.  (This is not the first.) I am actually afraid she is a sociopath.  She has been “diagnosed” as lacking empathy and also with pathological lying.  She holds us hostage every day.  We can’t even have a family meal without it going south.

I just want one day.  One nice day for me.  And I feel selfish even wanting that much.  I just feel that if I can put aside MY hopes and dreams and be content with what I’m getting for a wedding day surely she can be okay with changing her skirt.  Just one accommodation just once?

It’s too late to get in touch with her therapist today or in time for the wedding.  

Any advice?  Just for the one day?

I (M52) live in Boston, MA.  I have two teenage kids, my daughter is 15 (D15) and my son is 14 (S14).  The kids live with their mother (B44) in CT, they visit me every two weeks for the weekend (I drive to get them), and sometimes extended times (think X\_mas and holidays).  Their mother and I have a cordial relationship and agree on co-parenting styles.  Legally, we have joint custody.  She is an ok mother, but could be a lot better.

I work in scientific field (analytical chemistry) and have over 20 years experience.  The next step in my career should be heading up an analytical lab.  For several reasons, I am very unhappy at my current job, however, it is steady and safe.  I can be unhappy and keep going.  The Boston area is a good area to be for biotech jobs

in the before times (around Feb 2020)  I was approached by a recruiter about a job in San Diego, CA.  I decided to consider it and give it my all while pursuing it, to make the decision later on.  I finally had a Zoom interview July 14.  I gave a 45 minute technical seminar of my accomplishments, followed by 5 hours of 1:1 interviews with the team.  this was honestly the best interview seminar I have ever given.  Felt really good about it, the team and I clicked really well.  Things are moving slowly, but they want to schedule an onsite interview when conditions allow it.  All signs point to them making an offer at some point.  This does look like my dream job.

&amp;#x200B;

**This is the hard part:  the only thing holding me here is the kids.  I am very hesitant to move to the West Coast and far from them.  Right now, I am a two hour drive away from them, in case they need me, I go to parent teacher conferences, whatever.  I am planning to talk to them about the possibility and seeing how they feel about it.**

Overall I would appreciate some advice.  If I move to CA, I would come visit at least every two months.  Some things to point out:

1) I am from Central America and my parents sent me to this country when I was 13.  I always have resented them for this as I felt abandoned.  Since they will still live with their mom, this case is not so bad

2) I once took a job away form them in 2014.  It was hard.  I was away for 8 months, I would visit monthly and stay at an extended hotel.

3) With COVID19 travel will be iffy at best for the foreseeable future

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am considering a job that would make me move cross country away from my teenage kids who live with their mom.  I plan to tell them of the possibility this weekend and would love some advice please.

My husband ""C"" is 17 years older than his younger brother. He is 35 and his brother ""S"" is 16  I won't go into all the details of how we ended up taking custody of his brother but it's a long and sad story. ""S"" grew up basically an only child even though technically he has seven siblings. We have always had some sort of relationship with ""S"" but he came to live with us officially about two years ago. He has been doing really well and is generally happy, which take my word for it, is a miracle in of itself. When we brought him here we put him in the basement so he could have his own room and living space away from everyone else. It's nice because he can get away whenever he wants due to the fact that I have two toddlers and toddlers can make anyone crazy. 

I have a 4 yo and 2 yo and as many of you know it's a fight everyday to keep them on track. ""S"" pretty much stays to himself during the day and doesn't have much to do with the kids although he will interact with them on occasion. He has even been known to have pillow fights with them but like any teenager, he isn't ecstatic about little kids the majority of the time. Meanwhile, my two toddlers adore him. 

Last week I found out I was pregnant which was unexpected but not unanticipated because I have horrid reactions to birth control and I'm not on any. We weren't exactly wanting another child right now but ""C"" and I have come to terms with it and of course are happy to have another little one although we both agree the house will be full and we will both be fixed when this one is born. 

Needless to say, ""S"" is not happy. He's tried to convince me to get an abortion. he's tried to convince me to give my child away and he's mentioned selling my child. I'm not sure where he thinks I would do such a thing or more importantly why I would want to. He doesn't seem to understand why I want to keep my child as he thinks that it's too much money and he doesn't want to deal with anymore kids in the house (even though he only sees them on occasion when he's not working or playing fortnite). 

I remember being a teenager and not liking kids and I get it to a certain extent but it makes me sad that he is going to act this way. We spend lots of time together and I love him like my own son although the counselor describes us more as a sister / brother relationship. He calls me sis and I call him bro. It's hard for me and I feel sad but I certainly would not get rid of my child over a teenage tantrum. 

Tonight he stopped watching a movie with me because he said he was disappointed.  I'm not sure if there is something I can do to help the situation. I feel guilty when I know I shouldn't and that pisses me off to be quite frank. It's taking away some of my happiness about the whole thing when really it was hard to get happy over such an unexpected surprise to begin with.

Our child, 16 years old, has been with us for 2.5 years. She's made growth inany areas, but something I have a problem with is how to stay empathetic towards her past. My wife experienced a horrible childhood in foster care for nearly 10 years, and so we have an idea where she's coming from. The phrase i hear too much from our kid is ""Well I'm sorry I have _____ from [past event in foster care/birth mom]"" when we're in a disagreement about something. It also comes in the form of, for lack of a better term, oversensitivity towards things. Example is that we asked our kid to do some dishes (a chore they have everyday) and it always gets forgotten about. So I said before leaving ""Can you do some dishes? You know it should have been done earlier. The ""I'm sorry I..."" phrase came out. Her time in foster care, according to her, damaged her and she suffers from migraines that come about from heat and dishes, which wouldve been much easier to do in the morning if heat is an issue, and it resulted in a blow up at us. My wife knows what foster care can be like, she has told me of past horrors, but I can't feel empathetic anymore. I've tried listening, but it's like they like having an issue.

Last week my 15yo daughter told me someone she had been talking to online on Discord had threatened to “SWAT” her if she didn’t send him nudes. She told him no and then told me about it. I told her to block him and reassured her that the SWAT team wouldn’t just show up at our house because someone called them and lied about something. I called our local LVMPD substation and explained the story. We were fairly certain the guy lives in the UK, but we wanted to make a report if needed. We were told that since there was no specific threat and she had already blocked the guy that there wasn’t anything else to be done. 

Today, my SO came out of the bedroom and said, “Did you hear that? I think the police are calling someone out of their home. I heard them down the street but couldn’t see anything. I’m going to check it out.” Well, I’m a true crime junkie, so I put on my flip flops and headed out after him. My daughter followed. As soon as my SO got to the bottom of our walkway, we saw at least ten police cars at the end of our cul-de-sac and police officers with assault rifles pointed at us. We had no idea what was going on, but they quickly called my SO by his shirt color and told him to walk toward them with his hands up. Then they called me out by name and told me to do the same. At this point, my daughter wasn’t visible to them, so I told her to go back inside. 

We were cuffed at the end of our street, as we both were so confused, looking at each other and at the police, completely unaware of what was going on. They then called my children out of the house. My poor 13yo son had to walk down the street with no shoes, burning his feet on the pavement, wearing nothing but some underwear that were also too small. We were all handcuffed. My children and I were placed in a car to stay cool. My SO was not. 

They asked us continually who else was in the house, and we continually told them no one. They eventually cleared the home and only after that were we told what was going on. Someone (obviously the guy who had threatened to SWAT my daughter) called the police and said that someone had been shot inside our home. 

Now I know that “SWATTING” really is a thing and I know how it feels to be completely innocent and fear for your lives. Things could have gone much differently. What if we hadn’t gone outside to check out the commotion? What if they had broken down our door? (We are legal gun owners). What if my SO and I weren’t home and only my children were home?

- don’t make fun of what they like: let’s say your kid likes something, don’t make fun of them, don’t say things like: you like this? Why? (In a disapproving tone) that won’t make the kid feel good, and it will ensure they won’t open up to you 

- don’t make negative comments on the way they dress: teens express themselves through their clothes and choice of style, don’t say things like: “you look like a bum”, “don’t wear this, you look like shit”. That won’t make your kids feel good. 

- spend time with them one on one: my mom never did this with me and it sucks, because I have heard girls my age y’all about all the fun times they have with their moms and it stings knowing I didn’t/don’t have that. Please have 1:1 quality time together, your teens will remember that. 

Don’t be too critical: obviously teens need guidance, but being too critical will damage them, and let’s be real here, no one wants to be around people that criticize too much. 

Don’t compare your kids to other people: because let’s be honest here, what will you accomplish, what’s the point of comparing kids to others. And think about it this way, you wouldn’t want to be compared to other people, so how do you think your teens feel? Teens can compare you to others, and trust me, it hurts. 

Pick your battles: obviously fighting is inevitable, but parents are notorious for picking weird hills to die on. Before you do, think to yourself: it is worth it? Is this the hill I’m willing to die on? 

Don’t try to be their friend all the time: it’s not stable, if you act like their friend more than a parent sometimes, they will get mixed messages. 

Don’t forget what it was like being a teenager: remember, you guys were teenagers at one point, so you have an idea what teens are like. 

Don’t make teens feel like talking to them is a chore: teens notice that, and it hurts. Also, make them feel like they are important, with my mother, she talks on the phone a lot, so that made me feel like I am not important, don’t make your kids feel like that.

I tried getting her interested in many things, I introduced her to tv shows to help her learn the languages, I bought an iPad for her so she can draw on it, but apparently nothing was able to catch her interest but boys and online chatting.
I think I'm somewhat obliged to tell you that I spent my teenage doing exactly what she's doing now, I have been in some toxic relationships that took me years of therapy to get over, but now I regret that so much, if I spent it doing something beneficial I wouldn't have had such a hard time (for example learning english, I wish I did that earlier)
Sometimes I think I'm being selfish and that I should let her do what she wants and have her own experiences that she can learn from, but at the same time I don't want her to get hurt or regret it later, so HELP.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2479087,public,self,Am I making a mistake?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hzeeeb/am_i_making_a_mistake/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

She was a fantastic kid during primary and went to senior school with a mission to be ‘popular’. She then went from a sweet little girl to handful..

Picking her up obliterated drunk from the park at 14. Puking over friends parents houses at 15, sneaking into disused buildings and hanging out at crappy places.

During this time she would be disciplined, grounded, have phones removed etc and she was bullied after falling out with the ‘friends’ at school.

Her biological father has never been involved but is a drug user abusive manipulative man. This coupled with the bullying makes me feel guilty and go easy on her.

Recently we felt she had wised up, she was being more open and communications were better until recently....

Last weekend she was allowed to go to the park with friends she came home stoned.
This weekend just gone she wanted to go hang out in a rough part of town - we said we would rather she didn’t go but she’s older she can make the choice but we don’t think it’s a good idea.

She went, messaged at midnight to tell me she was going to a party and at 4 am I messaged her to check on her and she didn’t come home till 1pm the next day.

She wants to be an adult but she makes bad choices, she doesn’t introduce us to her friends so we have no idea who or what they’re like. She actively chooses badly. 

How do I empower her to grow up and still install discipline and rules? She pays for her phone, her clothes as she has an apprenticeship.

We’ve stopped taxi’ing her about which she’s annoyed about. 

She seems oblivious to the impact she has and is so self absorbed - help what do we do with her.

We want to take a holiday within the U.K. and she doesn’t want to come but I’m worried about leaving her behind.

She can be amazing when she wants, she’s funny and kind and bright.
I can see her peer group is not a positive group - do we let her learn he own path do we curtail all activity so she lies and sneaks about !!

February 2020

I have to tell you, I am shocked by the maturity of my 14-year-old daughter, Hannah (and the immaturity of her father).

Last summer Hannah started playing volleyball. She really fell in love with the game. She went to volleyball camp and joined a volleyball league in September. At first, Hannah played on a team for 14-year-old’s. She was one of the best players. Her coach told her that he wanted to make her a team captain. Then the program director noticed Hannah’s play and told me that Hannah had “good hands” and suggested that we transfer her to a more advanced team of 15-year-olds (Hannah just turned 14). I instantly started calling her “good hands Hannah.”

My wife and I hesitated a little, because we weren’t sure if it would be better for Hannah to be the best player on a weak team or a weaker player on a better team. (Malcom Gladwell’s books would suggest the former.) But Hannah told us that she really wanted to get better and it would help her to be on a stronger team. So she joined the more advanced team. This was a month ago.

Yesterday, Hannah and I got up at 6 in the morning to drive to a tournament that was an hour away in Colorado Springs. Hannah’s team played four other teams. Each game has two or three sets. Hannah stood on the sidelines for all the games and did not touch the ball even once.

I was really upset, for two reasons. First, I was thinking, what was the point of our using our Sunday to drive 65 miles and spend eight hours in a very noisy arena (you don’t know what loud means until you hear 200 teenage girls scream non-stop), just to see Hannah’s teammates play and Hannah sit on the sidelines. So, if I am honest with myself, this reason was more about me. We could have been skiing instead or doing something else fun.

The second reason was the one that was really breaking my heart. I saw Hannah on the sidelines while the other girls played, and I felt that she must feel like a second-hand citizen. But Hannah smiled throughout and cheered and high-fived her teammates when they scored. I looked at her and thought, she must feel miserable inside. Her pain must be my pain times a hundred.

Hannah’s team won every single game. The team moved on to a higher division. At the end every player got a victory pin. They took a group picture. Hannah was incredibly excited and happy. Her father… not so much.

When we got in the car to drive back, I asked her if she wanted me to talk to the program director about going back to the old team. Hannah said (I am writing this almost verbatim), “Dad, absolutely not. Being part of the team is not just about playing in the tournaments. It is participating in the practices. This was a very important tournament where we had the chance to move up to the next division. If I were my coach, I wouldn’t have played me, either. I am new to the team. She doesn’t know me well yet. Also, I am not as good as other girls on the team. They’ve played for years; I started less than six months ago. I learned so much watching the games from the sidelines. I could see the mistakes of the other girls and learn from them. I learned a lot today. I know where I need to improve. I need to work harder. Dad, I also got a victory pin!”

I said “Well, maybe we should go skiing during tournaments when they don’t play you. What’s the point of us being there?” Hannah retorted, “You don’t understand! If I don’t show up, then who is going to give them emotional support? When I’m on the sidelines, I’m cheering them on. I’m helping them. My team won! This is very important. I am part of the team.”

I was speechless. We drove for two minutes in silence. I had thought the smile I saw on Hannah’s face during the tournament was sitting on top of giant pain. I could not have been more wrong. She was happy for her team. She felt like she was part of something bigger than her.

My brother Alex called me and asked if Hannah got to play. (I had called him a few times during the tournament, complaining about Hannah not playing). I told him what she told me. I said, she is so much smarter and more mature than her father. My 14-year-old daughter showed me what it means to be part of a team. I have no idea if Hannah will be playing volleyball a year from now (I hope she will), but I know she is prepared for the life ahead of her. She’ll be a great asset to any company or organization she decides to start or join.

Ten years ago I would have looked at spending a full day at these tournaments as a chore. Driving an hour each way. Did I mention 200 teenage girls screaming? There are so many other things I could be doing. But awhile back I realized that there is a finality to everything in life and especially to kids being … well, kids. This changed my perspective on life. Instead of looking at driving my daughter to tournaments as an obligation and feeling victimized for being forced to do it, I *choose* to do it. And I really, honestly look forward to doing it. As we drive, Hannah and I listen to music and podcasts, and we talk. We go to lunch. We spend time together.

**Post-Script: BC (Before Coronavirus)**

P.S. I wrote this article in early February. I was jet-lagged from my trip to Europe, but I intentionally stretched this jet lag from a day or two into a week and used it as a creativity boost to write the series of articles I call the Jet Lag Series.

As I reread it today, it feels like I wrote it in a different era – in the BC (before coronavirus) era. Part of me is missing the normalcy of BC – seeing my relatives, my friends, going out to concerts and restaurants. I’d be delighted to drive Hannah to volleyball practice, or even to drive her 65 miles to a volleyball tournament packed with screaming teenage girls.

We tend to appreciate what we have only when it is taken away from us. In what I am about to say, I am going paper over the fact that people are sick and dying and that millions have (temporarily) lost their jobs. But a supermajority of people have been impacted by COVID-19 in a more superficial way – we are locked down with our loved ones at home.

This is now how I *choose* to look at the situation. Let me tell you a story. Ten years ago or so, my family – my wife and I, the kids, and my aunt – were driving through a park. I was driving my wife’s minivan and didn’t notice that we were low on gas and … we ran out of gas. The car stopped dead in the middle of a large state park. My wife was initially upset that we were stuck in the middle of nowhere. The normal me would have been upset, too. But the parent in me thought, “What would my father say and do?” I said to my family, “Think about it: If we drove through the park and nothing happened, it would have been just another time that we drove from point A to point B. Now we have a little adventure that we’ll remember. Our lives are not threatened; we are all safe. Let’s just make the best of it.”

This story lacks drama and suffering (thank god). We simply called my father and asked him to bring us some gasoline. In the meantime, we played soccer and walked in the beautiful park. An hour later my father brought us the gas.

My kids and I filed this little misadventure as a happy memory of when we ran out of gas in the park and did fun things. My wife put it into the mental file of when I forgot to check if we had enough gas in our (her) car before we started driving.

For most (not all) of us, the situation today is not much different from this drive we had in the park. We have an opportunity to turn it into a happy future memory. Embrace it. We cannot change what we are going through today, but we can change how we look at it.

Until last Friday I worked out of my office. My kids begged me to work from home. I stopped going to the office, and I am so glad I did. But not for health reasons (there is only one other person in the office, everyone else is working remotely).

I have never worked harder in my life than I have over the last month. I am doing research nonstop, building models, launching a new product (the [All-Terrain Dividend Portfolio](https://contrarianedge.com/the-all-terrain-dividend-portfolio/)), talking on the phone to my investment (friends) network, writing weekly letters to clients. Now that I’m at home, I try proactively to take time to do something with the family here and there. Mia Sarah sneaks into my office with Connect Four and tells me “I’ll beat you,” and we play a few sets. We all go for 15-minute bike ride, have lunch and dinner together outside, or go for a walk. I get a lot of work done but still spend time with the people that matter the most to me.

Our life is anything but normal, but other than the real pain others are going through, and despite my normal life being put on hold, I wouldn’t change a thing. I am embracing this experience. If not for coronavirus, ten years from now it would have been just another March and April in 2020. For now, and despite the real hardship many are experiencing, we have the opportunity to create happy memories that we will look back on when we transition to life AC (after coronavirus).",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2470123,public,self,There is no “I” in Hannah,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hye0hl/there_is_no_i_in_hannah/,all_ads,6.0,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '6V6w1DOiaWjuaE47ykGZkOkU5kLuC0cbvY1fubgyVsM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3UbaPjYQVV9pnJvbEiEBYDUhBWZr8cqx15l-l9qQWZY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5275b28e831965bde356eee902bb69bfe52517', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3UbaPjYQVV9pnJvbEiEBYDUhBWZr8cqx15l-l9qQWZY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba1052a7f9f95cbde97f576cd877749ed43fb8b6', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3UbaPjYQVV9pnJvbEiEBYDUhBWZr8cqx15l-l9qQWZY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76730bbb5214d4686d8b3d07a5d0cd21011e729a', 'width': 320}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3UbaPjYQVV9pnJvbEiEBYDUhBWZr8cqx15l-l9qQWZY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32af6e55a62995f8c0b5fbcddf7e839da37de07', 'width': 640}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3UbaPjYQVV9pnJvbEiEBYDUhBWZr8cqx15l-l9qQWZY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc8cdd50f9815d6cac18931e5c4f6578d5c23c92', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 750, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3UbaPjYQVV9pnJvbEiEBYDUhBWZr8cqx15l-l9qQWZY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b0d887f5ec08d225c333cb76781ff684af880cf4', 'width': 1000}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,0,

Her room does not go above 70. I found that she has been opening her window every night. She wakes up at 11am-12pm meaning the room is at 90 degrees by then and my AC is blowing out the window. Hence, the hot room. She is 15 and I have explained to her that hot day at noon + open window = hot room and she looks at me like I am insane. Her father thinks I don't have the AC on and am lying.

Then followed a bit of a rant/lecture about how even some grownups have toutous and it's really not that big a deal, but if it embarrasses her, he'll claim it as his own if they see it/tease.

Long story short, her mom has always engaged in some of the classic manipulative behaviors - fluid and unclear boundaries (asking her to keep secrets and be her mom's 'protector' at a very young age), unpredictable emotional responses (something is fine one day, terrible the next), use of guilt (how could you do this to me), moving the goalposts (of course you can do that, until the day of and then all of the sudden there's a reason you can't), etc, etc. Throughout her younger years, G has been very defensive of her mom and we have been careful not to challenge that relationship or say negative things about her mom, even though we have been pretty concerned.

My concern at the moment is that now this appears to have moved to financial manipulation as well.  There are other examples of her mom basically taking just G's money - of course with 'reasons' that make sense to a 16 year old but anyone else can see through - but here is the most recent. Her mom had an old Chevy truck that was sitting in a shed not running. Several years ago, she told G that if she 'fixed up' the truck, it would be hers. G spent the next two years working with her stepdad, who fixes cars, getting the truck in running order. Although her stepdad primarily did the work, G bought all the parts with her own money from working as a waitress. They mostly got the parts from the junkyard, so it was certainly less expensive then it otherwise would have been, but I believe G has put about $700 to $1k into that truck. Now, it runs great and is a pretty nice truck, and all of the sudden her mom told her that it was never G's truck and that she (mom) is going to trade the truck in on something new for herself. 

I don't have a problem with kids being asked to pay for vehicles. In fact, when I heard the plan I thought it was great. Nothing like paying for it and working on it yourself to help you learn about vehicle ownership! But I'm disgusted that her mother would just invalidate all the work and money her daughter put into it and take it for herself now that it's worth more and driveable. I think G recognizes to some degree that what her mom is doing isn't ok, but because of the manipulation and gaslighting her mom has done to her all her life, not to mention only being 16, she just doesn't quite get it. 

After learning of her mother's plan, her Dad and I told her that we didn't think she should put any more money into that truck and that we would help her get her own vehicle. When she told her mom that she wanted to get her own, her mom then countered it with a bunch of reasons why she shouldn't (she'll want to get a new vehicle when she moves to college, so why get one now; her stepdad won't work on the truck if she gets her own), and then offered to sell G their F-250 diesel truck for $2k. Which G is tempted by because she's 16 and loves big loud trucks. But of course, so expensive for a broke highschooler to drive (what parent thinks that's a good idea?) and anyway, we know that this offer is just about control. If G 'bought' that truck, what will stop her mom from just moving the goalposts again? 

We gently explained to her that the F-250 is not a good financial move for her and she seemed to agree, so hopefully she won't go that direction. But I really want to tell her to never enter into any kind of financial agreement with her mother again, because her mom won't hold up her end of the bargain. But I feel terrible for G - it can't be easy to recognize that your own mother is using and manipulating you. Any suggestions for how to gently help her figure this out? Or do we keep doing what we're doing and just make sure we are there for her when (if) she finally figures it out for herself?",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2456058,public,self,Teenager and manipulative mother,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hwfn6v/teenager_and_manipulative_mother/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

It's hard to reason with him and it would be a shame if I bought his brother (9) and sister (16) clothes and he's wearing a faded name brand shirt. The part that hurts my feelings is when our car broke down. I rode the city bus for months until I could afford another one. After getting it, he refused to ride in the car because it's old. He would rather stay home than to be caught inside it. If he keeps this mindset, he's going to have hardships unless he plans to work for the rest of his life to get all the lavish things.

He says he forgets but even when he sets reminders he still doesn't apply. He says his friends don't use it. 

When he's home I can force it on him. I have 3 younger kids and they apply sunscreen before going outside and periodically throughout the day. He doesn't mind using it at home and will even help the youngest apply sunscreen. 

Normally we like to use natural consequences. In this case that means he doesn't use sunscreen so he gets sunburned. However, is that the right move given how damaging sunburn can be and the increased risk of skin cancer? Part of me feels like it would be like knowingly letting him drive without a seatbelt.

Back story, my wife had him when she was 18 or 19. The biological dad wanted nothing to do with him, denied him his whole life, his family denied the kid, whatever. My wife stepped up and raised him as a single parent. I came into the picture 8 years ago so I've helped raise him since he was 5-6 years old. I am a strict parent, my wife is the easy lenient one. I will admit that I have spanked my kid, I was spanked when I was a kid and I feel all kids need that kind of discipline, especially when they are really out of hand.  
Fast forward to years 10 and up in his life. My wife lets him roam the streets in our town, alone with his friends. Now more recently, we've found out that he has been smoking pot with friends, unsure if he has done any other drugs but pot is a fact. I have left the discipline to my wife because we feel that if I get myself involved, I may hurt him more than I want. She has threatened to ground him, take things away, and he would cry and whine for a couple days and promise he wouldn't smoke pot again. Well that usually lasts less than a month and he's back to doing it. Now with covid and things, he has been out of school so he is free to roam during the day as we both work. His 11 year old sister recently sent us videos of his friends' social media accounts of he and his friends smoking pot on video! Little punk is smiling and laughing while taking hits. So a couple days ago me and my wife had a sit down with him, he wants nothing of it. He is freely disrespecting my wife and saying he doesn't care this, doesn't care that. So I speak up, not even raising my voice let alone getting physical and ask him why he feels the need to put down his mother like that when she is the one that stepped up to raise him by herself when his biological father abandoned him like a piece of trash. I even told him, he could hate me all he wants and he could stab me with a knife all he wants from the way I've treated him in the past but the last person he should be putting down is his mother. Granted I could have raised him and treated him better as a child, I was a strict parent to him. Meaning I would ground him over little things but I feel all kids especially boys, should follow some sort of guideline so they don't go out of wack.   
He has his own cell phone and he broke it recently and feels like we owe it to him to get him a new one yesterday. I tell him if he wants to be an adult so bad, when he thinks he can mouth off to us and go roaming as he likes, he can mature up like an adult and start paying his own bills like getting a new cell phone to replace the one he broke.   
We are just at a loss with this kid. If covid wasn't in existence, we really feel we'd be sending him away to some boarding school. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and refuses to take his meds. What are we supposed to do? We can't quit our jobs just to keep an eye on him.

This weekend he decided to buy a new dirt bike and the owner of the farm is such an amazing fellow, he told my young lad he could park it and ride it at the farm.

Today while dropping off said bike, the farmer says ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you"" at me.  ""How can I help you""? I asked.

""You did a great job with that one there"" he says...""Always on time, never misses a day, knows how to fix things and weld, always polite and cares about others"", ""Great job"", as he reached out to elbow bump me (Covid).

It was all I could do to keep my lump in my throat from turning to tears. Haha🤣

I dont know why it means so much, perhaps farmers are the best judge of character I can think of?

I’m kind of stressing disproportionately about something involving my 13-year-old child (AFAB, still primarily using she/her pronouns) and I just need some feedback. 

Basically, she told us about a year ago that she thought she was bisexual. We thanked her for telling us, told her “we love you no matter what,” etc — all the stuff you say. Since then, she’s begun identifying as lesbian and gotten very interested in LGBTQ culture. All of this is fine.

Over the last few months, she’s been expressing some interest in non-binary identities. And a few days ago, she told us she’s identifying as non-binary and wants to use a more androgynous name. To give you an idea of the kind of change I’m talking about, let’s say her birth name is Daisy and the new name is Payton. 

And I’m having a really, really hard time dealing with it. To us, it came out of the blue. She wasn’t a princessy kid, but all of her interests, hobbies, etc. have always been pretty feminine and she’s never expressed discomfort with her body or feminine presentation. She also doesn’t seem to want any boy’s clothes or anything, and showed us a meme about how “non-binary does not mean androgynous.”

Also, I have the typical old person confusion over what exactly “feeling non-binary” is. But I’m willing to accept that it’s a thing Payton identifies with even if she has a hard time expressing exactly why. I also wonder if some of this is just being bored in lockdown for four months, even though I know people don’t declare new identities out of boredom. 

I guess my question is, how can I best accept this about my child and be supportive when it’s hard for me to understand?",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2437895,public,self,Supporting non-binary child?,0,[],0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hto9s6/supporting_nonbinary_child/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

I know how it functions because I know biology and stuff, but obviously don’t have the experience and I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable, so how should I approach it? My husband is currently in the store buying pads but I wonder what can I do to make it as easy as possible

He doesn’t wake up until well after noon, he stays up playing video games all night, but since he’s my husband’s nephew and has only been living with us for the past 2 years, we’re trying to be realistic about his adaptability to contributing to chores and having expectations put on him for the first time in his life. It’s been a struggle getting him to even understand how to do his chores let alone doing them on schedule without being asked. (Mon - take out the trash and recycling, Tues - sweep kitchen, Wed - vacuum living room and hallway, and clean up the bathroom he exclusively uses, Thurs - pick up dog poo, then help with dishes Mon-Thurs.) We’ve had plenty of conversations about needing to wake up at a reasonable time and getting his chores done without being asked but the last two weeks (since we got home from a road trip and since we got him a VR headset JUST because he asked for one...) he’s back to not getting up until after 3/4/5pm and hasn’t been on top of anything. I have tried to not be on his ass about it because I feel like I’m always being the bad guy but the couple of times I tried to mention something needing to get done, it’s been met with exasperation and an attitude. Today I finally sat him down and explained that we’re not even asking for an hour out of his day and he has all day to do these tasks and it doesn’t warrant him giving us an attitude when he hasn’t done anything on time in weeks. So after he begrudgingly did today’s chores and one of his chores from yesterday that didn’t get done, he just went back in his room. The bathroom didn’t get cleaned up last week nor yesterday and this is a teenage boy’s bathroom so it’s basically disgusting enough to need a cleaning on a weekly basis (and until 2 weeks ago, used to be every-other-week but he always responded with “oh I thought I did it last week” so I finally told him it’s gotta be done every week then). So now I don’t know what to do. It’s 9pm, I doubt he has plans to get it done tonight, but we JUST had a conversation about this not even 3 hours ago so I don’t really feel like I should have to go remind him and I’m not looking forward the the response I would get from him...

My son talks to his friends quite a bit everyday on the xbox. I wouldn't allow it as much under normal circumstances, but this is how he is connecting right now. He's also an only child, so no siblings to interact with.

I am encouraging him to ride bikes and walk dogs with friends. Activities which I feel are safe. Hes done it a couple of times, but not often. (And now we have a freaking navy ship on fire so we can't go outside!)He has also done a couple of movie nights in a friend's backyard, but food from the host has now come into the mix, and others don't wear masks. So now I'm not comfortable with it.

It seems sometimes like we are the only family being careful. All of his friends are hanging out like nothing is going on, and I see this with other families all over social media. No masks, no social distancing. 

I check in with him frequently to make sure he's ok. He insists he's fine, and he's perfectly happy talking to his friends on the xbox. His school district just announced they will start online in the fall. I'm so worried about the social aspect! But, I think most of us are.

Her social anxiety means she doesn't go out at all except to travel between home and dad's home. Following years of school refusal, we managed to get some support. She is tutored at home by the local education authority because she cannot handle a school environment. Doesn't have real life friends.

At her dad's this weekend he noticed she was messaging someone and asked who. She's been messaging 3 other people, one in this country and two abroad, that she met on Wattpad. They then moved to discord.

I think we should know what she is posting online and should at the least have her usernames for her social media accounts, which we have for her other social media and for siblings. For example, she has instagram on the basis I can follow her. Same for sibling/steps fb and instagram pages (fiance follows his kids/I follow mine).

But she is reluctant to give her wattpad username, stating her reasons as anxiety and insecurity over the quality of her story writing.

The same applies for the discord group.

But for me, this raises red flags in conjunction with her not telling us she was messaging these people for the last couple of months.

I am really uncertain what to do for the best. Her dad (my ex) thinks its positive that she has friends, even if only online. I am more concerned that she's already closed off from real life, has no social norms to follow as she hasn't been able to attend school for years and wouldn't necessarily pick up on whether something was 'off'.

She insists she's being safe and not giving out personal information but she can't see what potential dangers there are.

She often shuts down. My concern is by insisting she shares her wattpad/discord, she will completely withdraw.

I have spoken with her to talk about my concerns and to get her point of view. I have said that I will need to talk more with her dad and step dad about what to do, given that she has not stuck to the boundary we set for all kids of knowing their usernames and being able to see what they post online.

Honestly, she’s funny, she’s smart (she doesn’t think she is, despite being told all the time), and she works harder than anyone I’ve ever known. During the global event that shall not be named, she’s been furloughed by her regular job and she’s been volunteering at the local hospital for three days a week, and a disability charity for the other three. She’s absolutely awesome. But, that behaviour doesn’t cross the threshold into our house.

Since she was little she’s had a problem with taking things, it started with food, in that she will eat and eat and eat and never feel full. When she was maybe 8, she went into the larder, took two weeks worth of lunchbox snacks and ate them all in her room. We didn’t notice until the next morning when we went to put her and her younger brothers packed lunches together and there was nothing there. I remember crying when I found it, we were living on a very small budget and we couldn’t afford to replace it. Questioning her has always just resulted in “I don’t know” answers, because she genuinely doesn’t know. She doesn’t know why she’s doing it, and she doesn’t know she’s not supposed to be doing it. She’s graduated from taking food now to taking things from our rooms, I’ve had underwear stolen, I’ve had money taken, Christmas gifts, she even took a compact out of my room that belonged to my grandmother that still has a little bit of the powder in it and took it to work, I didn’t notice for weeks and in the time she had it, it got completely destroyed. Now not only is the food cupboard padlocked shut, my room and her brothers room is too because we’re constantly having our privacy invaded, and when we asked her why, she doesn’t know and she doesn’t understand why we’re upset by it. It’s easier to lock it down than to try and get her to stop.

The latest thing is razors. She’s 19, so she’s wants to explore stuff and do the things teenagers do and that includes shaving her legs. The trouble is, she’s about 12 in terms of her mental age, and she can’t do it unsupervised. She tried, but she cut herself so badly that she left a trail of blood from the bathroom to her bedroom (that she didn’t notice). She tried again, same thing. I told her that she absolutely is allowed to shave her legs, but I would help her next time so I can point out where she went wrong but it happened again. She refused to ask for help, so I said that if she wasn’t going to, and she was just going to continue butchering herself then she wasn’t allowed to do it until she was more “ready.” Which, physically, she is, but mentally, no. So I put her razors in the bin, and told her exactly why, that I 100% understand why she wants to shave (leaving out the fact that it’s unnecessary societal pressure and she shouldn’t let anyone tell her that she has to), that I will help her, that I will ALWAYS help her and there’s no need for her to do it in secret especially if she is just cutting herself to ribbons every time (and not noticing the cuts, and leaving the blood trail for me to clean up), so until she feels ready to ask for help, her razors would be binned. She agreed, she doesn’t know how to do it, she does need help but maybe it’s not such a big deal for her just yet and I was like, cool. End of discussion.

Or so I thought. I’m a busy mum, and there are times that I leave my door unlocked because I’m doing other things and it slips my mind, and the same goes for my 14 year old boy. This morning, she’s getting ready to go to the hospital for her volunteer shift and she’s got a bright red moustache made of spots. Her legs are red and covered in the same spots. I immediately freak out and ask  if they’re itchy, has she eaten something unusual, I wonder if it’s an allergy. But in fact she’s been rummaging through our bedrooms in the relatively small windows that we leave them unlocked, finding our razors and shaving herself. She shaved her face. I asked why, she doesn’t know. I asked where she found the razors, she didn’t know. Turns out she’s used her brothers for her legs, and mine for her face. She’s actually even been taking used blades out of the bin and shaving with those. I’m sitting here an hour after she’s left for work and I’m still trying to figure out why she would shave her damn face. She thought she had a moustache, she didn’t at ALL, but she does now, albeit a. bright red, pus filled one.

I live in Fort Knox. The kitchen is locked, my bedroom is locked, my sons bedroom is locked. We can’t even leave them undone for five minutes or she’ll be in looking for stuff. We cant have any privacy unless we lock ourselves in our rooms. She doesn’t sleep at night, so every morning I have to wake her up. I have to help her get dressed because she just stands there for ages until she’s late for work if I don’t. Brushing her teeth is a daily battle, she doesn’t like the electric toothbrush noise, but if she uses a manual, I have to do it for her because she won’t do it properly. I’m exhausted. I love her to death, but it’s been 19 years of this. Medical professionals told us she’s probably outgrow her ASD as she got older, because as it goes, it’s fairly mild, so we don’t actually get any help aside from a couple of years of therapy when she was little. We’re certainly lucky, because we know it could always be worse. But she is *getting* worse. She doesn’t melt down as much as she used to but when she does, it’s more violent and destructive than it used to be, and now there’s this constant state of vigilance that we have to live in because she can’t keep her hands to herself. We went back to the gp last summer and asked for her to be re-assessed because we need some help with this, they agreed and told us a referral would be made and we could expect it in about 9 months. That would have been in March. The thing that shall not be named has obviously slowed it down, but honestly I don’t know how much more we can take. 

My mother wasn’t a good parent. She was physically and mentally abusive to me, and I am very conscious of that legacy and I have never, ever hit my children. I prefer to sit down and talk things through with them, most issues are solvable that way. But this morning, after a long weekend of her screaming at me instead of talking to me, of her sitting there with blood pouring out of razor burn on her top lip and swearing she doesn’t know how it got there, even though I know she can’t help it, I felt it. I felt the sheer bloody anger rising in me and I had to walk away. I know I’m not my mother. The fact I walked away shows me that I’m not but I worry that I have it in me. I felt it today for the first time and it scared me.

I'm in a hard spot, i divorced my ex wife when my daughter was two. She wad emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive and had been arrested for assault against me and her ex a few times. She was sober with me but after the divorce immediately went back to drugs. I got custody as she had no way of t as king care of my daughter and liked partying and using more anyways. I remarried fairly  quickly and even though we've had a couple big bumps my wife and i have always put kids first to the point my daughter calls her momma. A few years ago my ex went to prison for a bunch of separate charges but somehow got everything  deferred except felony child abuse. Naturally with the litany of things I've learned along with the laundry list of other incedents including going to pick my kid up from cps during her visitations, i was awarded sole custody. My kiddo is now 13 and after several  years is out of prison, against my better judgment ive allowed phone calls and facetime. On a semi related note, even though she is a phenomenal  teen her phone has gotten her into trouble in the past (basic dumb kid stuff) but now as a rule is subject to as non invasive  quick looks as possible. Basically check net history and apps for stuff she shouldn't have. I know that sounds bad but im 100% against the parent apps and she is smart enough to make parental control settings worthless. But at any rate she is damn near a perfect kid for this age. Now that its summer i got lax on bed time rules and usually tell her go to sleep when my wife and i go to bed (12ish), but ive noticed her clicking off her screen really fast. I let it slide at first because benefit of the doubt, but its happened more frequently  and her attitude has gone to shit. So i decided to check her phone and noticed the last text she had gotten was at 1230am from her mom. Ive already talked to both of 5hem previously and both know this is 100% against the rules. My dad senses started tingling so i checked her messages. For lack of a better word she has been grooming my daughter. She has her following  her work schedule to talk and text non stop, every  other text is increasingly aggressive i love you messages. I'm not talking oh i love you so much but ""i love you more than the whole world, you are my everything, i don't know what i would do without you well be together soon i love you 100% dont ever let any one doubt that shit"" was about half the last one. She is not going to see her any time soon, i know this pattern as ssf he did the same thing after she would ignore her a year at a time during my deployments leaving her with my wife missing all visitations and start this up as soon as i got back. Im at a loss, only thing i can think is phone and laptop are picked up after 9pm. Do i nix communication? I hate the supervised call stuff because it makes me look worse even though im trying to help maintain a healthy relationship with her mom.

I’m a 25 Male from the U.K. My Sister-in law contacted me said her son (he’s 14) has been searching porn, I said immediately that it’s normal and I was and my mates were doing the same at his age.

She said his search history shows he’s been watching porn of a disturbing nature,  father raping 8 year old girl, mother kissing son, rape in general etc. Hentai and lesbian kissing I think most teenage boys have been guilty of looking this up. He’s been caught searching porn before (who doesn’t delete their history lol?) 

There was an incident at school last year where he groped a girls arse and kissed her on the lips without consent. 

His mother is rightfully concerned and disturbed by this and we’re all a bit worried how he’s going to turn out later in life and would rather nip this in the bud now. I don’t have kids myself and so yeah, find myself here asking for advice? 

Some background context: My sister-in law was a victim of marital rape with her ex husband which her son knows about. Her new husband has abused her also (strangling, hitting, shouting etc) been telling her for years now to leave him. 

I reckon it’s a nurture over nature. If he’s exposed to these bad things and there’s no consequence to these heinous actions then is it any wonder if the boy is thinking it’s ok despite being told it’s wrong?

So before hand, I appreciate any and all advice.  

I am a career military man with two children from a previous marriage. I met “M” when I was about 26 years old in 2001 and my two prior born children were 4 years and 3 years old. We got together, had a quick relationship that saw us become pregnant with my second daughter, third child. I asked “M” to marry me and she said yes and we were not married until after our daughter was born. Before we were married she was great with my other two children, but a few weeks after our marriage, she sat me down one night and said “I’m not stepmom material so either you sign your rights away permanently to your other children and never see them again or I’m leaving you”. Well, that was easy, I had the marriage annulled and we went our separate ways with me still seeing our daughter under state guidelines and paying my support. 

Then I was told that I was being deployed abroad. Once that happened “M” said you can just stop seeing our daughter and then maybe she’ll forget about you while you are gone.  She cut off all visitation which led me to hire a lawyer who filed for an emergency hearing to force her to allow me visitations, which the judge approved and ordered.  I was deployed shortly after she turned 2 and gone for a year and a half. I had supervised visits upon my return because she was still so young, which “M”‘fought but the local police department enforced.  

As our daughter grew up, she slowly cut off seeing me and wanting to be with me, always siding with her mom about everything. I understand children can be influenced so just did my best to stay in her life. It finally got to where she stopped coming all together and avoided me at all costs. BUT, on a few occasions she did come to stay with me and we have had a blast.  I thing but smiles, laughs, and love with lots of photos of us doing just that. 

Fast forward to today. Our daughter is now 17 years old and only contacts me when she wants or needs something. Other than that she has completely cut off all communication with me. She’s super smart and just finished high school a year early and called me for help with college, which I had no issue with. I helped here do her FAFSA and worked with the college to make sure she is set to start this fall. After that was done, I haven’t heard from her again for a good while. 

Today I learned that her high school had its graduation ceremony, which she attended, but I didn’t learn about it until later this evening. I was not told nor invited. I sent her an nice message telling her congratulations and that I was proud of her and that she should have told me. She just shrugged me off. I also told her that  had she invited me I would have been there and I hope she invites me to her college graduation and that now that she’s done with school, we should work on our relationship. That message received no response at all. 

So, what in the hell should I do now? I love my daughter but her mom has instilled in her this deep hatred for me that has absolutely no reasoning behind it. I’m starting to feel like I am just wasting my time but don’t want to be another poster bad dad. I’ll take any advice that you have and please feel free to ask any questions.

We live in a COVID hotbed area in the US.  

It was taking a toll on their mental health and they had really stepped up (some happily some not) to do more around the house when needed especially with daycares closed and their dad and I WFH.

We decided to reward them each with one socially distanced, outdoors visit with ONE friend.

Today was my daughter’s turn.  She told me she and her friend wore their mask the whole time and other than walking to a convenience store were socially distanced at the park the whole day.  She even went so far as to put on a big show of asking if she could hug her friend.

My son came barreling down the stairs angry as hell and showed us some social media posts from my daughter, hanging out with a big crowd of people, at the store with no mask, taking maskless selfies with her friend, who was NOT masked for the day as requested, and finally, in SOMEONE’S HOME.

She’s definitely grounded, though I haven’t figured out the details.  

What do I do about isolation?  We bought her a brand new iPhone we scarce could afford in exchange for her helping with her siblings during this time.  I don’t think it’s safe for her to watch them which means another sibling will have to take her days.  But I have already ‘paid’ each of them in their various desired currencies.  It isn’t fair to the other siblings.  

Also I don’t know how to manage the shared kitchen and bathroom.  

Grounding during a pandemic is also tricky with no other outlets.  They each have a tv and gaming system, a laptop, etc.  They aren’t deprived although this particular child always feels as though she is.  To take it all away when there’s nothing else...I’m just not sure about.

I’m fuming mad.  Any advice would be helpful.  

Please don’t shame me for letting them go out- they have literally not left home in four months and I had to balance all the needs including mental health (the teens all suffer from depression, it runs in the family.)",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2400060,public,self,Teen defied COVID restrictions.

My wife goes to pick her up, and she is in a swimming pool, with her best friend (female) and 3 boys. She took her pants off and was swimming in her panties and a shirt. Wife was livid, and I feel rightfully so. I was at work, and she told me.

I just feel that underwear is a more intimate thing, something you should keep private. Our daughter argues that it covers the same as a bathing suit.

My daughter is smart, beautiful, and usually makes very good choices, but I believe the pressure to be accepted by boys that she is attracted to will cause her to not think things through.

My family lives in a large Canadian city.  About 5 years ago my oldest son (now 17) took to basketball and immediately fell in love with the game.  He has always been a very tenacious, single minded, strong willed kid, and when basketball became his passion he was all in.  He began practicing all the time, waking up early, going to the gym 2 - 3 times a day, training with his school team, training with his rep team, getting individual training, training on his own, etc.  The level of dedication (obsession) he gave to sport began to be all consuming.  He radically changed his diet to what he thought it should be, (tonnes of fruit and veg, very little protein) despite my wife and I explaining what a proper diet should be.  It got to the point we had to take him to sports DR. to set him straight with his diet because he wasn't listening to us and bordering on an eating disorder.

My wife and I are not sports people, but because we love and support our kids we are committed to helping them achieve their dreams.  My son, around the age of 15, decided he wanted to play D1 or D2, and then maybe a career playing in Europe if he doesn't make NBA.  (He's now barely 5'10 and plays point guard BTW, so quite short in basketball world)  He has managed to get himself onto some good reps teams , but has spent much of that time on the bench, playing very little. He is still 110% committed to his dream, training most of the time like an elite athlete would, but he is often disappointed in himself and his performance in any given game or training session.  He can be very hard on himself.

Because my wife and I are not sports people, we are having a hard time judging his true potential.  We are told by our trusted advisors who know way more than us that he certainly has the spark and tenacity needed, but he seems to choke more often that not when he does get his chance to shine.

He gets good grades and applied to a few schools in the states, but ultimately he was only accepted by a Christian Prep school with a basketball focus in a southern state.  My wife and I are both non religious (both grew up Christians though), but our son has expressed a passive interest in religion so we're not too opposed to  him going to a Christian school and learning religious / christian teachings.    My son wants to go, despite the raging pandemic in the U.S., despite any of us having been to the campus, despite 2 to 3 to a dorm room, despite never having been away from home more than a week for camp, etc...

My son wants to go, no question, but my wife and I are really struggling.  On one hand, who are we to stand in his way?  He has worked very hard to get to this point, to get accepted to the school, and his single focused nature tells him going to the U.S. only way to get better and seen by U.S. scouts.  On the other hand, there is a very scary pandemic going on obviously, and sending your kid down into that is a very uncomfortable thought.  And if he's benched a lot of the time on his rep teams here, is he good enough to make a go of it down there?  If Basketball gets shut down in US, then what?  (He will continue going to a high school with a good basketball program in Canada if he doesn't go to the US, but no assurances he will be played much)

This decision needs to made soon.  Do we let him go or say no?",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2384059,public,self,Should I send my kid to school in the U.S. to follow his basketball dream?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hnk3b5/should_i_send_my_kid_to_school_in_the_us_to/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my post. I have a 13.5 year old. He has been going out with a girl the same age for 8 months now. We have open conversations about sex and safety, he has told me he is not thinking about it. He says when he does he will talk to us. But, I know it only takes a few minutes behind a closed door for teenagers to make and irrational decision and get pregnant.

What should I do to make sure they are smart? Should I have an open door policy whichever room they are in? Communicate with her parents to make sure we’re on the same page and that they have the same rules at her house? 

I feel like if they really wanted to do something they could find a way. I think I’m overly nervous because I had him when I was a teenager and I don’t want him to endure what I did to get where I am.

School was cancelled when COVID hit. I’d often ask her to do a chore here or a task there to help around the house when she wasn’t doing online homework. I work full time and am a single parent. I also have a 3 year old. School ended in early June and I found out that she didn’t complete her courses like she said she had. 

We’re now into week 3 of what’s officially summer vacation in our state and she’s constantly needing me to tell her what I need help with around the house or she does nothing. Like, it isn’t obvious that she needs to launder her clothes, clean up dishes in her room, feed and change her cats litter (which makes her room stench like hell itself), and last, but not least, help me with the dishes in the kitchen. 

I’ve had multiple talks with her that I’m at work 8 hours a day and I ask that she help me with one or two things so that I’m not stuck coming home to work after work. I come home to find that she’s just now decided to shower, is hungry, and nothing but her hobbies have been done all day. At that point I’m finding myself trying to cook around dirty dishes, needing to shower myself, and my 3 year old. And all she can account for doing is, well, shit. 

Today I had enough. There were a minimal amount of dishes in the sink. I texted her at 4pm (one hour before leaving work) to ask if she helped with some dishes. No answer. I get home and she’s watching tv on the couch and texting on her phone. She picks up her things and goes straight to the room. 

I avoided talking to her because I’m just gonna explode. Instead I send her a text saying, “from now on don’t use my dishes if you’re not going to help clean the kitchen.” I baked some frozen pizza for a quick dinner and she came out to get some...put it on a piece of paper towel and retreated to her room.

We, like everyone, did online schooling for the last 2.5 months of the school year. Despite having every possible advantage (good school system, computers, internet, etc.) The end of the year was a struggle from the time our governor announced no more in-person schooling for the year. 

I chalk that up to a few things, depression, grief at missing year-end events, ad hoc instruction by teachers with little or no online instruction experience, and heaps of procrastination. There's a good bit of parent prodding that happened to get us across the finish line, I'll admit. It was not the happiest of times.

It was always our plan to do a high school requirement as a summer online course this summer. We registered and paid for it months ago. Well, it started today and so did the tears.

It's as if we just opened a barely healing wound here today. Feelings are still raw, and DD wants to throw in the towel already.

I'm trying to explain all the benefits that we get from doing this now. I am explaining how this is a course that's always online, taught by teachers who are experienced at delivering on line instruction. How we get a chance to build new distance learning skills in a relatively low-risk environment, which will serve us mightily if we are forced back into online learning next year.

I dont know what to do. I'm heart broken and depressed. I think my oldest child hates me now and theres nothing I can do about it. 

My first born lived with me until he was 3.5 years old. Right just before he was 3 I had left for training for a job that didn't work out and I left him with my mom for that time. His father wanted nothing to do with him during his first few years and had barely started seeing his son so I didnt feel right leaving our son with him solely. I was gone 1 month and 6 days in my attempt to build a better life for my son and I. 

Being gone from my young child like that did a number on me and i was a mess by the time I was able to get home to him. A few weeks after returning home I was sexually assaulted. I was not doing well and my mother continued to bulk of the care of my son. I had turned 18 about 2 or 3 months prior to these things happening. 

While i was trying to recover mentally, my mom sent my son to live with his dad against my wishes. She told me it was best for him and I believed her. He immediately cut as much contact with my son and I as he could. He even went as far as literally forcing me to sign papers only allowing me to see our son every other weekend.

From there I spiralled pretty bad and started seeing a therapist regularly and got on meds. Once I hit 19 I got on some medications that were starting to help. I started going to the community college. And I got a vehicle. As soon as I started doing better I started pushing for more time with our son. My ex took him and left the city. Every few months they would contact me and let me see him. I never knew the address and when i did find out where they lived they would move. They would constantly change their phone number and I couldnt afford a lawyer. After a few years of this hell they moved back to tucson.

 I used the documentation I had stating every other weekend to force them to allow me visitation. This was going well until our son started telling me things like his father told him his step mother was his real mother, that I didn't really love him or want him. I started to repair my relationship with my son and show him and tell him how much I loved him and wanted him. 

When my son was almost 10 he told me he didnt want to kill himself but that he wanted something else to kill him. I took him to a behavioral health place to get him help. They spoke to him with me and then alone. They gave me a referral and a paper stating that he was being abused at his dads and that he was showing symptoms of suicidal ideation. 

His father refused to allow therapy and since we technically still have joint legal decision making they wouldn't see him without consent of both parents. Then my ex said they were moving out of state. 

I borrowed money and found a cheap lawyer. My son came over again and his father made him take a cell phone. I found bruises on his arms and took pictures. My son told me how his step mom would punch him or grab him and sometimes made him bleed from the pinches. 

After he returned to his father I found the cell phone in his room. I went through it and found countless texts between two adults about drug deals and selling pills. His father or step mom doing the selling and people texting to buy. This was the phone that was left in my kids care. I made a police report. I printed screen shots of all the texts and gave everything to my lawyer. 

When court happened my lawyer didnt submit any of the evidence I had compiled against my ex. This included threatening texts from my ex about letting them move or he would disappear again with our son and other things. 

Due to a clerical error my mom still had my portion of custody (I was 15 when I had my son). So that messed up the court hearing and they wouldnt talk to me because apparently I was not the legal guardian at this time even though I had visitation papers. The court let my ex move with our son as a temporary thing and I got everything transferred into my name. 

My lawyer continued to tell me he would submit the documents eventually (before the next court date) blah blah blah. And he didn't. I lost another court hearing which ended up with me only getting a total of like 4 weeks a year with our son. 

I borrowed more money and hired a better lawyer. She ended up getting me most of his school breaks but by that time he was in school and the courts deemed a move of households and schools wouldn't be fair to my son. So I was stuck. 

Every time my son came out to see me I had to repair my relationship with him all over again and when we finally got to a good point he would have to go back to his fathers house. 

He was supposed to come here for 10 weeks this summer. This is in the court papers. My son refused to fly so we agreed to come and get him and drive. He refused to come at all and stated he wouldnt even leave his bedroom. His father told me I had to agree to only 4 weeks and that's it or I wouldnt see him. 

I called my son on the cell phone that my husband and I pay for and asked him why he doesnt want to come here. My son said he doesnt wanna be stuck in a ""2 bedroom studio in the ghetto"" and that hes realized all of the lies ive told him ""over the years"". I know I have never lied to him about anything except things like santa or the easter bunny. 

We have had some financial issues during his time here where we weren't able to do everything we planned but ive tried making up for that with quality time spent together. 

Since all of this he wont tell me what he believes ive lied about. The police In his city wont help without a court order stating that they have to. I called them. My son won say anything more to me except ""I love you and miss you too"" and only in response to my messages. He wont talk to me at all beyond that. 

I explained to him that we pay for his phone so that he and I can have a relationship with each other. That got me a couple short responses and then it was back to silence with the exception of the love you miss you too. 

He wont talk to me, he wont let me talk to him. My lawyer said I could file papers holding his dad in contempt and force the issue but im afraid doing that will just hurt my son if I force him down here. 

I cry every day and this has been going on since early to mid May. My younger son is heart broken. I hide as much as I can from my younger son though because I dont want him to know how hurt I am. My oldest doesnt really know much about that either. 

My husband wants to cut my oldests phone service temporarily as punishment. We havent sent his birthday gift to him because we always give it to him in person when he comes down for the summer. He even refused to come down for his brothers birthday.

In terms of covid, we definitely are on the more vigilant end of the spectrum with my wife setting the standard (and living by it). The challenge is our boys have friends from families that are much more lax. They don’t maintain social distancing, wear masks when they probably should, etc. Makes it hard on our boys when they try to get together. It pained me to hear from my younger son last night that he feels made fun of by his friends because of the higher standards he’s expected to adhere to. And I understand where they’re coming from because we have not been hit hard but covid where we live and don’t know anyone that has had it. In the bigger picture, this is not that big of a deal. We will eventually get through this. And I think this is a pretty typical teen challenge even without something like the pandemic. Still, it would be great to get some additional perspective from other parents. What’s worked for you? How are you teaching your teens to be socially responsible and to hold the line while still allowing them to interact with friends? How do you balance between respecting their POV but not compromising on what you feel is ethically right?",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2344047,public,self,Holding the Line During Covid,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hhyski/holding_the_line_during_covid/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

My cousin and I are very close, she got divorced 4years ago, around that time I moved to the same town as her and we live less than 5 min away of each other. Since then we become even more closer, sometimes I help her out with her daughter (now 14) she has  stayed hundreds of  times at my house for sleepovers, or to have dinner with us, she has traveled with us for a weekend getaways and all that, at first I always though she would be the perfect mommy helper ( I have 7M, 4M, 3F) but after she started spending more time with us and becoming more of a teenager I realize that while she loved my kids she wasn’t into that “role”. 
Today we spent the afternoon together after 4 months without seeing each other, at some point when I was fixing the kids dinner by myself  my niece approached me and say “ Hey look I made a Instagram group accidentally and you are in it, it was an accident you weren’t meant to be in it, just erase it” I didn’t pay much attention and carried on with my evening,  it wasn’t until later that I checked my IG, the group was her, another girl her age and a 22yo guy. She send them 2 pictures and a video, one picture was her with a bored face, another was my daughter and son playing together, and the video was very short maybe 10s, the kids playing together in toy kitchen set up  and it had an IG caption in the corner that said  “This is Fucking Disgusting”.
I  contacted her mom, and asked her about it, and  told her how uncomfortable it made me feel. 
It really broke my heart, she claims that the group was accident, that the video was sent to her group of friends as a joke, and the caption was about the kids saying they were eating chips with hot sauce. 
Still I’m utter uncomfortable about her sending videos/ pictures of my kids with this caption to unknown people, I get that this wasn’t  meant for me to be seen, and it was probably more like she was bored to be playing with babies.
She’s is suppose to come back in Wednesday for my 4yo birthday, but now her mom says she thinks we hate her... she says she’s gonna talk with her, but I honestly not sure what to do, just to leave it to her Mom or say something to her if she indeed comes over on Wednesday. I also no longer feel ok with letting her alone with my kids, since I don’t know if she’s sending pictures of them to who knows who.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2343073,public,self,Accidentally saw a video my 14yo niece send to her group of friends regarding my kids,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/hhtklm/accidentally_saw_a_video_my_14yo_niece_send_to/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

My oldest is 18.5. She won’t do anything, she has switched schools a few times and is currently working slowlllllly towards her GED. She’s in a Running Start type program where she can earn free college credits till she’s 21 but she’s only managed to get a couple credits in two years (? Lost track??) so now is “focusing” on the GED. 

She won’t do chores, she gets easily overwhelmed and will rather cry than just DO it, and I’m talking ONE or two chores. She will stand at the kitchen cabinet rooting through every glass complaining they are “dirty” but won’t just wash one by hand if it doesn’t meet her standards. She will tell me “by the way, the bathroom floor needs to be swept”. My response, “ok the broom is in the closet”. But she would never actually sweep. She’s rude to her sisters, constantly bossing them around and not letting them near her. She’s a terrible role model and causes her sisters a lot of distress. 

She’s NOT mean and she’s NOT a risk taker (meaning she’d never do drugs or drink or even cross the street without looking). She never yells or curses. She’s kind, caring, and artistic. She’s actually very smart. 

She does have anxiety and depression, but she won’t do anything about it. She won’t go to therapy, she will start and then stop going. She won’t take her meds, she is always waiting for the “right time”. For example now she has a new RX for an anti anxiety med that the bottle says to take in the morning. But she sleeps till 2 or 3pm so won’t take it since she’s never awake in the morning 🙄 She doesn’t like germs so now won’t work because of Covid, she won’t even entertain the idea of an at home job.

I know all these lockdowns and everything going on in the world right now has taken its toll on all of us. And I’m sure that bears some weight on what I’m about to say, but I am literally losing it here. 

When COVID-19 struck, my anxiety was already through the roof, as I’m sure was the case for many others. My 15 year old is severely asthmatic, so thing number one is keeping her safe. As she’s gotten older the asthma symptoms aren’t as frequent, but they’re no less severe when they do come around. She’s an athlete and being so active has actually seemed to help with it. 

She’s extremely social. She hates staying home. She’s involved with so much stuff at school that it literally kept her busy all day and she was so exhausted by the evenings she would be asleep by 9:00 every night. Straight A student, she’s on the cheerleading squad, she runs track, she does choir. 

Then enter lockdown. I knew it was going to take a toll on her. I knew things were going to change for her, and as much as I knew she understood, she started seeing her friends hanging out again and doing stuff as things started to open back up. 

Eventually, about a month or 6 weeks ago I started letting her hang out with a few friends whose parents I knew took it seriously and etc. But what I’ve noticed in the last month is a whole different kid. 

She’s always been a little mouthy since she was about 11 or so. I pick my battles. I don’t think every little eye roll needs a severe consequence. She does get grounded and gets her phone taken, etc., when the attitude turns into disrespect, for sure. 

So cheerleading is about to finally start back up THANK GOD because she needs that structure back. But lately, the attitude and the things she says have made me completely crazy. 

And it’s over the smallest injustices. Like not letting her and her boyfriend hang out in her bedroom with the door closed. What?! I allow them to hang out, he comes over, but he’s not allowed here when I’m not, she’s not allowed at his house when his parents are gone, they go to the park, they go get ice cream. Appropriate things for 15 year olds. He’s a nice kid and his family seems nice enough, but they’re teenagers and I’m not naive to teenagers making bad choices based on hormones and not brain cells. 

Or not letting her walk places alone. Or even walk with her friends after dark. She accuses me of watching too many episodes of Dateline. Ok, whatever. But these are safety concerns, nothing to do with me trusting or not trusting her or her age or anything else. Do you think any kidnapper ever that wanted to kidnap someone said, “Eh, she’s only 15. I’ll go find a 20 year old.” NO! It’s not safe ever. Not at 15, 25, or 50. Just not smart. 

And she cusses. A LOT. She’s never cussed at me, and really not that much in front of me. But when she’s on the phone, half the block can hear her. I try not to make a big deal, because my language isn’t pristine either. I could pull the “do as I say, not as I do,” line, but I don’t think that’s entirely fair. She’s threatened to run away. She says she hates me. She called me the worst mother on the planet yesterday because I made her put her seatbelt on 🙄 I always tell her to put her seatbelt on, but yesterday I guess she just didn’t want to. 

It’s almost like she’s regressed in maturity in the last 4 weeks. And it doesn’t help that I’m very reactive. And I know it, and she knows it. I really try hard not to be. I try to check myself. I try to say things like “I’m sorry you feel that way,” but it comes off more sarcastically than I intend it to. 

I’ve been told my whole life that I’m brash. I’ve never had that soft “mom” voice that you see in movies and stuff. I was a mom at 17. I’ve made plenty of mistakes along the way. As I’ve gotten older, obviously I’ve matured, changed my own behaviors, etc. 

But for the longest time I was like, no way is being a mom this easy. My kids have been easy-ish until now. They’ve generally listened, followed the rules, got good grades. Pushback here and there, but for the most part, pretty laid back kids. 

I realize my daughter is at an age where she is trying to break free and assert some independence, but she’s not an adult. She still needs guidance. And I’m torn between saying (not literally to her, but to myself) fine, go ahead and do that, because I know what happens and you’re going to see that I was right.... or, you’re the kid, I’m the parent, tough shit. 

I don’t believe in invalidating children’s feelings, but we all get frustrated and say things we wouldn’t say in a rational state. I’ve said to her the “because I said so” line. I’ve said, “I don’t need to give you a reason.” I’ve said, “My house, my rules.”  All those things my parents said to me growing up that I don’t necessarily know whether they still apply to kids today. 

I’ve read books. I’ve went to counseling. Kind of seemed like a waste of money. Maybe just not for us, I don’t know. I just wish I could remain calm and in control in the moment. I tell myself, “This is what I’m going to do.” And I don’t care about getting the last word or being right. She can make whatever smart ass comment she wants as I’m walking away, because I feel like I’m the adult and I need to be the mature one. So I feel like walking away when things are getting too heated is the right thing to do. That way I can cool off, she can cool off. 

If we’re somewhere that I can’t walk away, like in the car, I try to shoot her a warning and her favorite thing to say is, “I don’t care.”  Then I tell her, “You’re in control of what happens next.” Because I want the onus and accountability to be on her and her decision on whether to stop or keep going, because I feel like a lot of times she has tried to put the responsibility on me for punishing her and “ruining her life” because I took her phone or whatever else. And usually at first, I won’t engage or I’ll say, “I’m sorry you feel that way,” or “Okay {daughter}.”  

I try to tell myself that if I was a bad parent, she wouldn’t have any rules. I wouldn’t force her to take responsibility for her actions. I wouldn’t hold her accountable for her behavior. But I’m starting to feel like a complete failure. She doesn’t ask to do all that much and I actually don’t usually tell her no. She hangs out with the same group of kids all the time. I know the kids, I know their parents, and I don’t have any qualms with her hanging out with them or going to their house or whatever else. The things she does get told no about, is because it’s either inappropriate or unsafe for a teenage girl. That’s it. 

I may be slightly overprotective. Her asthma almost took her from me twice. Once when she was 8 and once when she was 13. ICU for days, on a machine, full respiratory arrest. And it was terrifying. And as a result, I’m sure I can be a little (or a lot at times) smothering and overprotective and I’ve tried to back off some. 

These are all things I realize about MYSELF as a person, and the one thing I wish I could develop better skills on is remaining calm IN THE MOMENT. And not reacting and engaging and regressing myself to a battle of wills with a 15 year old. Counting to 10 doesn’t work. Walking away works sometimes. It takes me less time to cool off than it does her, so I usually try to talk to her before she’s ready and I end up just leaving her be. It could be hours and sometimes days before she’s not mad at me anymore. And then I try to passively y’all to her about it, like if we’re driving somewhere and just casually bring it up. And she does apologize for things she’s said and so do I, but it seems less and less time is between the apologies anymore. 

I’ve literally said all this long-winded backstory to ask if anyone has anything that’s has worked for them that’s not some, “go take a walk, count to ten”. I expect 15 year olds to try their parents. But I also expect more of myself as the parent to not allow my 15 year old to control MY emotions with HER words.

She'll be 18 in October and will be entering her senior year of high school this fall. That means next year she'll be heading out our door for college. She's a pretty responsible kid and has never given us much trouble. 

She started dating her boyfriend in October. They have known each other since elementary school. His family lives 3 doors down from us and their younger two boys and friends with my boys. Their daughter has babysat for our younger kids when my daughter couldn't. Overall I feel very comfortable with their family dynamics and the relationship. I am not naive enough to think that my daughter tells me everything but she tells me a lot. For example, she has told me that they thought about having sex but didn't because her boyfriend is leaving for college this fall and she doesn't want to do a long distance relationship. He ended up being okay with that but she was worried they would break up and confided in me.

His family invited my daughter on a beach trip in July. It's just them and their kids. They said their son will have his own room, my daughter will share with his sister, and their younger boys will share a room. They are super Catholic so I was surprised they offered but was okay with the trip given the details. My thoughts are that they are 18 and 17. If they want to have sex then they can probably find a better place than the room next to the parents on a family trip. My daughter's father disagrees. She splits her time between our house and her dad's but has been staying at her dad's because she wanted to see friends without risking her T1D brother. He is not completely against it but says he doesn't think it's a good idea and is inclined to say no. He said he would be more okay with it if she was 18 even though she'll be 18 in a few months. We are going to further discuss this with him but before we do I wanted to see if I am off the mark on this.

Need some advice. My step daughter experienced some trauma a few years ago and has since struggled with a number of things on top of just being a regular, moody teen. Right after the trauma, she started working with a therapist while with her mom, but then six months later, the therapist said it didn’t seem to be doing much for her and she just wanted to talk about school friends and their drama. Her mom stopped taking her, but then a few months later, we noticed she was experiencing more depression-like symptoms and we asked her mom to restart therapy sessions. Our daughter shared after a bit that she didn’t feel comfortable talking to the therapist, and stopped going again. 

Fast forward to six months later, and she kept asking if her dad and I could find her a therapist, so we did, back in January. First few months were great, she overcame a lot of topics, but now she’s feeling like she can’t really open up to her therapist anymore, and even when she’s sad, she feels like she can’t bring it up. 

I’m a bit frustrated her therapist just keeps swiping the card and not telling us she isn’t getting as much from our daughter as she used to. BUT, I’m here to discuss that my daughter has now asked to go to a new therapist. 

I have seen one therapist sporadically for the last 8 years. I haven’t been in over 9 months, and just pop in when I need to vent or unload things, but he and I really clicked. I can’t imagine doing that if I didn’t click with someone. 

Is it weird to switch therapists often? Do you think she just needs to find the right one? Tonight she even said she feels like after a while she just can’t talk to the therapists anymore, but I worry they’re losing the history and the progress.

It started with attitude and being disrespectful to us. Then, it quickly escalated into a bigger mess. He started skipping a few classes and sneaking out occasionally, which quickly turned into flat out missing school and attempting to run away. We punished him, but that made him escalate his behavior (eg stealing our money to buy burner phones when his phone was taken away) Therapy didn't help because he would lie and say that we were abusing him (which is not true at all) to avoid taking responsibility for his actions and to make us look like the bad guys.

Last summer, after we busted him for running away, my son threatened to commit suicide. We took him to a psychiatric hospital, where he was observed and evaluated. When he got evaluated, he was diagnosed with ODD and some anxiety disorders, as opposed to his previous diagnosis of ADHD. We got referred to an ODD specialist and had him put on ODD medication. These things helped in a major way. He stopped sneaking out. He stopped stealing. He started attending school regularly. 

However, yesterday I got a call from his teacher saying that he had not completed any homework since the end of April. When I asked him about it, he pretended that he didn't know what was happening and refused to tell the truth. Eventually he admitted that he did not do his work because he was tired of school and thought that it was stupid that he had to do his work. We spent much of last night fighting and arguing about this because he refused to do anything. He even attempted to run away. Now he is finally completing his work. 

I can't believe we are back here again. We have been nothing but loving and supportive towards him, and we really thought that things were looking up, only to find out that we had been lied to and that his bad behaviour is returning.

I've tried her having her own treat jar. I've tried buying a big box of individual snacks and each kid gets one. I've tried getting her her own big bag of something and requesting she leaves everyone else's stuff alone. Nothing works.

As well, she'll often not finish her dinner, which she needs for the protein, veggies, complex carbs, etc, saying she's ""not hungry"" only to raid the cupboard later.

As it happens, oldest daughter enjoys time with dad and they share sporting hobbies, so this is fine. 

Then my daughter tells me she got drunk. I was taken aback and was pretty shocked but let her keep talking. She had 6 drinks so yes, fair to say she would have been. Dad got her the drinks and was with her and some of their friends and his home. This conversation happened in a moment when she dropped by to grab something, so I thought I would address it when I had some time to think and decide how to approach it because honestly I was in shock but we had guests and she was with a friend. When I did approach it the next day she burst into tears and told me that I am why she feels depressed and it’s no big deal and to leave her alone. So then I text dad to say we need to talk about this. His response, “I was with her the whole time and was talking to her”. Talking about what, I don’t know. Turns out it’s happened more than once but possibly not to that extreme. So, he lets her know that I have contacted him. She freaks out and wants to basically live there. Tells me that I should talk to her, not him. 
I made it clear that I was unhappy with this, that it is about her health and well-being and the relationship with alcohol that concerns me, we have a history of alcoholism on both sides and not only that, I’m also her parent, i will step in when I am concerned. I got advice from my therapist who suggested finding an opportunity to talk to her alone, addressing the facts of alcohol on teenage brains etc. Was a bit uncertain of this was the best approach but was readying myself for a conversation. A couple of days later I see her, it’s her birthday, not ideal for a heavy conversation but assumed we had the weekend and I would bring it up. She decides to get picked up early so time was cut short. Next day she posts a meme on social media about alcohol, so I text her to ask her what is happening, I feel worried. Again, will be coming to collect some stuff, would like to live with dad. I feel like my options are talk to dad again, risk damaging our relationship by doing this and/or involve authorities. Or try and find a way to talk to her again.. I’m not sure and I feel like any of the above will bring on more anger but clearly I can’t drop it. Just feel very stuck and afraid.

I've had issues with my 16 yr old daughter sneaking out of the house with her (now ex) boyfriend in the middle of the night, and the device being missing is worrisome.  As I was looking through the car, I kept hearing rustling near the house.  I thought it was an armadillo that I had seen a few nights ago going under my house.  I was making loud ""TSSSSST!"" hissing noises to try to scare it off.  For some reason I decided to say out loud, ""Ok, come on out.""  And someone stood up.  It was the 18 year old boyfriend.  We had forbade him coming here and forbade her from speaking to him over three months ago.  It's a long story, but in addition to him coming to help her sneak out frequently, he called an uber and helped her run away and hide in his back yard.  His dad is an explosive dangerous person who has made threats against my wife and I stating that we are ruining his life by my daughter and his son talking on the phone at 3am and because his son had to take a trip to planned parenthood to get tested for STIs when my daughter tested positive for chlamydia.  His dad accused my wife of distributing drugs to minors and made claims that he would report her to the DEA and other people that he knew.  This guy apparantly pulled a gun on his own son the night my daughter ran away, but he also said loud enough for her to hear that he was going to blow her brains out.  The son confirmed this in a facebook messenger conversation with my daughter afterwards.  


Fucker was in my yard at 3:30 in the morning.  I've never cussed anyone out.  I may have woken the neighbors I was so loud.  I know better than to touch anyone and was satisfied with him speeding off as I tried to photograph him and then calling the police.  He's lucky I'm not any other human being.  


 I eventually found the iPad in my 6 yr old son's room under his pillow.  Sneaky... but no evidence in browser history or running/installed apps on any devices that she's been communicating with him.  


One time this fucker was inside my house around this hour.  But that was back when my daughter and him were communicating.

So this isn’t some kind of “straight girl not understanding her gay kid” issue. 

My daughter is bi. She told me about 6 years ago. Obviously it wasn’t a big deal and it didn’t change anything. She only told her older sister, myself and her dad. She tried telling friends but they recoiled like she was some sort of toxic monster and it destroyed the relationships.

She is known for doing “things” for attention that are over the top and only last a few weeks. I’ve posted about them before. (The last one was fake stuttering. Within a few days of my post two of my other kids called her out about the stuttering and she hasn’t done it since.)

The. Next. Day. Suddenly she’s out and proud. Fantastic. I love a supportive coming out story. Here’s the problem...

She is shoving it down absolutely everyone’s throats. She hung a pride flag. She changed a sign in her room to a quote about being gay. Every profile picture on absolutely everything has some sort of LGBT photo or reference. It’s EVERYWHERE. If it can have a rainbow, it’s now got a rainbow. She works it into every conversation. She captions every photo with some sort of flag, rainbow, quote... something. 

All of her friends are also posting photos of her saying something like “my bi bestie” and just things that wouldn’t normally be posted.

I’m genuinely nervous this is one of her “attention” things. Not being bi, but the way she’s going about coming out.

My other concern is that where we live, it isn’t “ok” to be different, especially gay. To which obviously I take massive issue with. But my fear is she doesn’t understand the hatred in the world and shoving being gay in their faces when they don’t understand isn’t going to go well.

She has been granted dozens of scholarships, most of which are religion based - I can see those being taken away. I won’t go into all of the other concerns but they all center around her screaming about being gay when it isn’t necessary and her accomplishments being diminished over it.

I feel like I need to say “Be who you are, you’re fine... but the way you’re doing it is problematic...” Opinions?

TL;DR My bi daughter is shoving being bi down everyone’s throats and I’m concerned because she does things like this for attention and she doesn’t understand the hatred in the world. I’m concerned about how it will affect her. 

And, just to clarify - I don’t care that she’s coming out. I LOVE that she’s comfortable. It’s HOW she’s doing it. She is also not claiming to be bi for attention, she’s being SUPER EXTRA about it for attention.

Our daughter has been driving for months but passed her test a little over a month ago and is waiting for her license in the mail, it was a rough year for everyone and she was looking forward to being able to drive her best friend to go do mundane things and just have fun doing what teenagers do. She invited best friend to go get brownie mix at the grocery store and then go over to bake at her grandma's and initially her mother said she could, but then bestfriend's mother went back on it and decided she wouldn't allow bestfriend to be driven by my daughter since she just got her license. My daughter said she's not mad because it's precedented behavior by best friends mom, but she's disappointed because she doesn't have anything to look forward to and there's nothing good going on in her life anymore.

Basically what the title says. My 13 year old has been going through a really rough patch the last couple of months. She's stolen money and weed from our roommate, and nicotine vapes/vape cartridges from me. She was grounded for a full month over the theft from my roommate, and we forced her to give everything back to him and apologize. 

So last night I forgot to bring my pack of cartridges to my room when I went to bed, but my partner thought it would be a good idea to leave them there to see if one would come up missing. Sure as shit, it was gone this morning. No one in the house uses the same vape device that I do, so that rules out everyone but my kid. 

She will not fess up to it, we've searched her room and came up empty, but we've searched her room soany times in the past month it wouldn't be surprising if she hid it somewhere else in the house. 

Would we be wrong to ""steal"" something out of her room and tell her we don't know what she's talking about when she asks about it? She has to learn a lesson here, and it doesn't seem like anything else is working. We don't want to make things worse, since she is/has gone through a lot in her 13 years, but we can't just let stealing or nicotine addiction slide. 

If it's a bad idea, please let me know. If you have a better idea, please share. We're lost. TIA!

Edit : We have removed her phone, it was taken for a month for the first theft, and we've taken it again now. We've added to her chore load, we've been spending more time together as a family in case this is a cry for more attention, we've had long serious discussions about how stealing can and will ruin her life, we've had a police officer come and talk to her, we've had her school resource officer come and talk with her.

Additionally, I wanted to try it because of how controversial topic it is in politics ( I’m a poli Sci major) 

Anyways I smoked a street away from my house and my neighbor basically saw me in the middle of a anxiety attack and offered to help me and my bf. (He only smoked that day because I wanted to and in reality he hates weed because of the anxiety it gives him) 

Anyways this happen a month ago and I guess my neighbor decided to tell me mom this week. BTW. MY MOM IS A STRICT HAITIAN MOM. SO SHE thinks it’s basically the worst thing on earth I could’ve done. And now she’s saying he can never come here again and I can’t see him. 

I don’t know how to make this right. I just wanna be able to stay in my relationship because I’m in love and i don’t really have friends and him and his family are basically my only friends.

Step Dad has taken a second wife in another city. Mom is emotionally not taking it well which I understand and only focuses on her 2 toddlers. The house they live in is in rough shape. 

My nephew has a wonderful heart but has no drive to do anything. He struggles a lot in school and lies about school work/completing chores. He goes to sleep at 5am playing video games and wakes up at 2pm most days during the summer. I feel like his mom has tried to enforce rules but that doesn't last long since she is tired with everythingelse. They don't have a particularly good relationship. The one thing he does do very well is take care of his two younger brothers. 

I teach students his age but I know being a guardian is totally different. Where do I start as far as fostering good habits like a sleep schedule or showering?

I am looking for advice with my 13 year old daughter. She is an incredibly smart , beautiful, funny , artistic kid . Unfortunately, she does not see any of these qualities in herself and is painfully shy . I won’t go into too many details but I had her quite young (21) and was married to her dad until she was about 6 . Her dad was quite abusive towards me and had absolutely no interest in being a parent . Unfortunately, after I eventually left , he refused to see her unless I paid his rent ( which I did for a while but could not sustain while raising a child on my own ) . Obviously that was quite hurtful for her and impossible to explain . I have tried counselling for her but she absolutely hates it and will refuse to talk . Whenever I try to talk to her about anything emotional, she totally shuts down . About a year after we left I actually started to see a really positive change in her , she was starting to socialize, doing well in school , taking part in extra-curricular activities.  Last year ( grade 6) I noticed she started to withdraw from her friends and only really hung out with one other girl . They seemed to get along well and had fun together so I wasn’t hugely concerned. This year they started middle school and something happened between them to cause a falling out . I am not sure of the details because whenever I ask her she gets really upset and does not want to talk . It breaks my heart because now I just see her becoming more and more withdrawn . She is too shy to try to make any other friends and just has no confidence in herself at all . Before the lockdown happened I had her enrolled in an art class with 2 or 3 other kids which she seemed to like but she never spoke to the other kids . Whenever I had meetings with her teachers they would tell me she does not talk at all during the school day . At home she is really talkative with me ( as long as it’s not a sensitive subject ) and will joke around , dance, etc but as soon as we step out of the house it all changes .  I try my best to fill the role of both friend and mom but I am not 13 years old and I can only fulfill that so much while still being the parent . I am worried because now that she’s been out of school for so long I feel she will continue to regress socially . I don’t expect her to suddenly become super popular and confident but it would make my heart so full to even see her interacting with one other kid her age . Does anyone have any experience with being shy at that age ? Any advice on how I can help her to make friends and become a little more confident in who she is ?

I'm going to have to write some long backstory to explain what I'm dealing with here, so please bear with me. 

Backstory:
I (F24) had a really rocky relationship with my mother in my teens. More so I think than the usual teen drama. My mother is an alcoholic and is extremely unpredictable, emotionally abusive, sometimes physically as well. I got out of there when I was 16 (went to live with my father and grandparents 6+ hours away), and have slowly been able to rebuild that relationship with my mom with distance. I had a baby at just barely 18, and my mom has, out of wanting to know her grandchild,  been on ""best behavior"" around me for the most part since.

I still have 2 younger sisters (currently 14 and 15) living with her, though,  and they haven't been so lucky. They've gotten to live with her through a long, stressful, abusive (from both sides) marriage, the aftermath of that divorce, 3 suicide attempts,  multiple involuntary mental hospital stays,  the list goes on. Their father (different from mine) had been supporting them as much as he could, but financially was unable to try for custody. In 2018, he got in a terrible motorcycle accident and passed away at 39 years old.

IMO, both of my sisters are in extreme emotional distress, and dealing with it in very different ways. For this, I am going to focus on the older one (turns 15 in 2 weeks). Let's call her K. My mother initially tried to take my sisters to therapy after their father died.  But right out of her playbook from when I was a teen, she took them to her therapist and insisted on being present, so that the kids couldn't really talk freely or bad mouth her. I think they went a handful of times, but obviously wasn't very productive. Younger sister (P) copes by retreating into a shell and watching tv all day to ignore her feelings. K on the other hand has always been more social.  Even before her father died, she was very angry at my mother for her suicide attempts, and would do everything possible to avoid being home. She'd go to her dad's for the most part, but now that he's gone, she's mostly been staying with friends. 

Current events:
It came out last week now that the friend K has been staying with for the most part has ""relaxed"" parents who basically let them go do whatever they want. So the two of them have been going out and partying, getting drunk, and having sex. For K, I think a lot of this is her trying to escape from the stress of my mother's issues compounded by the death of her father, which she's never really been given an opportunity to process.

My mother, I think, did actually take some good steps with K. She got her to a gynecologist to get her examined/tested for STDs, and also get her on birth control. 

But K is clearly spiraling out of control. Mom called me to talk about it, and I suggested that K come out and stay with me for at least a few weeks. The idea is that distance from her friends and that situation will help her breathe and reset.  We also figured that she might be more open to talking with me than our mother. K is on board with any plan that gets her away from mom for an extended period, so I'll be meeting my mom half way to pick her up next weekend.

My problem is that I am no therapist, and I truly think that is what K needs. Being that she's underage, I don't think I'll be able to take her anywhere while she's here with me. So I just wanted to pick the brains of you all. How can I best help her?  My instinct is to just let her talk to me when she's ready and let her tell her story, no judgement. But past that, I have no idea what to do or say. I'm pretty young myself, and in the grand scheme of things, really not that much more experienced in life than she is. I just desperately want to help her in any way I can.

I talked to her on the phone yesterday, and she's already saying ""yea it'll be nice to see you, but it'll all just be the same when I go back"". She said some other things too that make me fear that she could be having suicidal thoughts as well.

But I don’t know what’s the matter. I treat my family with respect and I’m never hateful to them. Now we have disagreements but I am a very relaxed person I never raise my tone it’s never physical and overall it’s usually just common disagreements. That’s with the rest of my family. However, my mother is a different type, she’s always hateful to me calls me an asshole calls me a lazy fat ass which I’m 6’5 and weigh 180 pounds which is pretty normal. Overall she just seems to cuss at me and I’m getting really damn tired of it. Anytime I bring up a valid point against her it’s always I gave birth to you and you live in this damn house for free and then I have to tell her that’s a normal family works. And she always says how I’m gonna be a failure in life probably flunk out of college which I don’t see how because I’ve never done drugs, alcohol and I make straight A’s. She always brings up when I say you need to calm down and stop screaming how her mother was so much worse than her and how I am not even compared to her mother. And anytime I would also try to tell her that what she’s saying is hateful, all she does is give a shit eating grin and smirked at me and say shut up, Another thing is when I talk to her if she’s going to relay the information to my dad or something which my dad is a very kind man sure relate like I was fucking either screaming at her or saying it like a total douche bag and being a total cocky asshole which I don’t I literally never raise my tone to her or anybody else. And when we go anywhere either she doesn’t invite me, Or she acts like a big brother having to drag his sister along to go meet with friends which if you’ve been in those shoes you know you don’t want to. But I am the only one she is like this towards in the family I have tried lots of approaches I’ve tried going face-to-face I’ve played the passive game I really don’t know how to get her to treat me like her own freaking child. She also goes off on how I don’t do jack shit around this house, and how in one year I’ll be moving to college and then my lazy ass can do it then. Which isn’t true I do everything they ask the first time and I do it right so I don’t have to go back and do it again now there’s a couple times like I’m not gonna be able to do everything at the speed of light, but everything does get done within a small timeframe. At this point now when I leave for college I will probably never come back unless this gets fixed I will never see her again she will never see her grandchildren and I’m dead serious about it I really don’t understand why she’s so hateful to me 24/7 and then she says how hateful I am to her when in reality I’m always pretty nice to her because I’m trying to have a good relationship with my mother. But I’m open to any and all suggestions because at this point I don’t know what it is.

Obviously he has some serious issues going on. 

I'm just at a loss as to what should happen. He isn't equipped to deal with the world and will undoubtedly land in jail one way or another without some sort of intervention. I have a 14yo daughter (his half-sister) in the house that I am now concerned about.

His mom doesn't know how to deal with this and for the moment is letting it go... shes currently in full mama bear mode.

And I was just telling her I’ve been on it for a year and a half and she was asking me if I started having sex then and I said no not then. Long story short I guess she assumes I AM NOW currently having sex. (Which I am)

I’ve been with my bf for 8months and we started having sex about four months ago. He’s my second boyfriend but my first. 

Furthermore, when my mother came home from work today she said out of nowhere “I heard you’re in stuff” in Haitian creole (basically insinuating sex). Then I just laughed it off and thought nothing of it. Then we were talking about our days whatever and I ask what did u mean by I’m in stuff. And then she said “I would hope you would come to me about it first but I think you’re starting too too early. I thought I could trust you. I thought I could trust you to make the right decisions but I guess not.” And I was just puzzled. So I replied “what do you mean?” And she said nothing, nothing. 

Anyways I’m pretty sure my gramma told mY CRZY STRICT MOM I’m having sex with my bf. 

I would like to know how can I address my backstabbing grandma because I never said those words and I never asked her to spread the word.

Friday, he starting making statements like ""if I get sick (COVID-19), don't try to save me."" I got a hold of his counselor right away, trying to be subtle about it, and asked to have a meeting right away. While I waited for a response, my son and I had a lengthy conversation about how not only would I fight tooth and nail if he ever got sick, but that effort doesn't just apply to times of crisis. We're always there, and we can listen or direct him to someone who he feels comfortable talking to (just in case he doesn't want to mention some things with us), and that's completely okay. At the end of that conversation, we got down to him not seeing his self-worth. Told his counselor everything as soon as I got a chance, and started going through text lines and such for my son reach out to. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as he got out of his meeting with the counselor, whom he confides in pretty well, he was anxious and wanted me to hear what the meeting was about from the counselor, not himself. Finally, he just said that he hated his sister, and that hanging out with her, or even her presence in the room, was a stress for him. He's never tried to harm her, he just really wants to avoid her altogether. Not only that, but he wants to kind of monopolize the time with us and exclude her whenever possible. His counselor doesn't seem to think of this as an urgent matter, and let me know that he'll be calling me tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I let my son know that I'm not mad at him for what he is feeling. He always brings it up when it comes to his sister wanting to hang out with him, or even talk to him, so I don't want to facilitate a manipulative behavior in him. We were kind of redirecting her to keep them separated, but this cannot go on forever. And, she's going to question why they went from close and laughing all of the time to Frozen-sisters status in a matter of  weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months back, his school showed the dangers of school shootings and how to detect a student that may be of concern, how to report to an adult and try to get anyone in need of help to the right people, news reports of the school shootings this year, etc. This was the first trigger. He would text or call my husband and myself (we're both teachers) every chance he got. He would panic if one of us left the house for groceries, appointments, anything. This is when we started taking him to counseling. Now, though, the new triggers are the current pandemic and quarantine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seriously not sure what to do, I'm losing sleep, and seriously just slowly taking things that he could possibly use for self-harm or any kind of attempt. As for his sister, she's pretty oblivious at the moment. She's just concerned whenever he seems to want to be alone, but then ends up hovering over him and trying to make him smile. He has warm-line numbers, and all options open to him. I've even told him that if his thoughts get really dark, or he's worried or scared, just to come to us and ask to talk to someone, no questions asked. What else can I do? We're trying to get him back onto a routine that he had before (he does well with check-lists and schedules), and that seems to help a little. But, what of a relapse?

For example, in one of his classes he would have had a 97 if he just did a short assignment the teacher assigned every week. All he had to do was read one chapter and answer a couple of questions. He didn't do any of them because he said he knew he could still get an A in the class without it. He ended up with a 92 instead. I am not upset with him. I know he still worked hard but it annoys me a little that such a simple assignment got blown off because he didn't feel like spending 20 minutes doing work he thought was pointless. Freshman year we had some issues with him trying to use his disability as a free pass to slack off. His teachers and sports coaches were being way too lenient with him because he is Deaf and it took me going up to the school to get them to hold him to a higher standard. I know some things will be harder for him but we never let him use that as an excuse. He has an interpretor for class and his teachers print out notes or upload them online so he doesn't have to copy notes. He is entitled to accommodations but wr try to limit it to things he truly needs. 

I don't want to punish him or anything. He is doing well and I am not going to punish him for having a A- average. I am hoping this will sort itself out. Next year he will be taking 1 AP course and 2 honors courses so I am hoping that he'll naturally have to push himself more but this year he took 2 honors courses and found them to be easy. He didn't push himself in those courses either and still ended up with a 92 in honors English and a 89 in honors European History. 

I want him to push himself because I think college is going to be a shock to the system if he's used to not studying or trying and I don't want to pay for him to flunk out freshman year. I also want him to have plenty of options for college. My oldest just graduated high school and will be starting college this fall. Her GPA was pretty much perfect, she founded and was president of a club, she did a varsity sport and was involved with other clubs that held competitions. Yet she was still rejected for her top school.

Our son is much loved and he’s making me proud every single day because he’s everything that I wasn’t as a child. I made sure he got everything that I was lacking growing up. 

So basically the past decade or so friends and family have been asking me whether we’re going to try another one. I mostly shrug it off because I’m not interested in going through another pregnancy (mine was hard) and taking care of another child (It’s a huuuuuge of responsibility as you know!) whereas I see people around me having kids every year and they don’t seem to care about their kids future (I say this because I know that they’re not financially stable/jobless and they barely make ends meet), they’re not giving their kids enough attention because they’re too busy worrying about money and the kids end up neglected and addicted to gadgets.

I’m a parent but I actually think that many parents mess up their kids. Adverse childhood experiences stay with you and you don’t get over it even when you’re 50!!! (I’m not 50 but I see a lot of messed up adults). My son is wonderful but I still don’t know how he’s going to turn out as an adult! I’m afraid that I might mess him up because I give him too much affection and not enough rules!! This is one of the reasons why I think it’s best that I shouldn’t have another child.

Background: My (23F) sister-in-law (14F) lives in another state but my husband is considered her legal guardian (her mother has some legal residency issues). I've known her since she was 9, and I see her as a full sister. Her mother is a single mom and is working a lot and out of town a lot. 

I have always tried to be supportive of my SIL, and I've tried to maintain a judgement-free zone with her. At the same time, because her mom isn't able to be around much, I've done a lot of parenting with her. SIL has told me things that she hasn't even told her mother or brother (my husband).

I have always kept our conversations private, and I have been very straightforward about sex and if she needs contraception EVENTUALLY. I told her that I think she should wait til she's at least 18, but if she decides to do it earlier that I would help her so she doesn't get an STD or pregnant. 

I've talked to her a lot, always trying to listen and be an open ear/open mind. She started talking to this boy and would constantly FaceTime him when she would visit us. I had my suspicions that they were a thing, but she said he was just a friend. I left it at that.

Fast forward to this evening--I finally started a TikTok account and found her profile from my contacts. She has a bunch of inappropriate videos (none visually sexualizing herself) but some where she TALKS about getting ""freaky"" on camera with the guy she's been talking to (she has screenshots of his Snapchat reactions to her teasing him that way...etc.). She has other videos where she basically says ""what am I good at??"" And some of the Snapchat responses she screenshot were ""s*cking d***"" and ""being a dirty wh**e.""

I was shaken and horrified. I called her, CRYING, expressing to her how I felt like I had failed her, that I was sad she didn't trust me enough to come to me about these things and that she lied to my face.

She just said ""Ok"" in a kind of careless, rolled-her-eyes-through-the-phone way. I was absolutely devastated.

While I know she might not actually be doing these things, it's strongly implied with these videos. 

I'm frustrated:

1) at her mom for not being more on top of her and being there for her emotionally 

2) at my SIL for doing all these things and responding to me so heartlessly

So what's the advice here? My husband and her mom are going to have a heart to heart with her about her emotional needs like ""we haven't been here for you, how can we be better emotionally available to you??"" because to me something deeper is obviously going on. I'm so hurt, but I'm not sure what kind of say I can have in it since I'm not blood.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2277458,public,self,14 year old is posting about doing sexual things on social media.,0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/h82rde/14_year_old_is_posting_about_doing_sexual_things/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

(14)  


For background, for all of elementary and middle school, he was an A/B student, with one C in math in the 8th grade. This year however, freshman year of high school, his grades have plummeted. In the first quarter of the year, I was unaware of his grades. He said he lost his report card and didn't actually look at it before leaving school because they got rushed out (my house is out in the county and my children go to school in the city, so I drop them off at my mother's house in the morning and pick them up when I get off work in the evening, most days). I didn't think much of it at the time, as he tends to lose things quite often, and had told stories before of his school's, at times, somewhat dysfunctional management.   


Fast forward to the second quarter. Report cards go out again, and this time he brings his to me, and there are multiple Fs and Ds across both quarters. A long winded conversation ensued and he spouted some nonsense about ""not having developed autonomy,"" and ""not consciously realizing"" that he actually had to do his homework due to ""precedent."" His words. He's very intelligent but can be so infuriatingly stupid sometimes.  


I decided to let it go for the time after he made promises to improve himself.  


Again, fast forward to now. A few days ago I received a call from his biology teacher while on my way to work, and she informed me that my son had completed *none* of his biology work. When I called him and asked him why this was, he said he'd been working through the other classes and biology was last in line. Okay. I hung up and continued my drive. Yesterday and the day before, he was working all day on his biology work. I asked him just last night if he'd completed all of his other classes, and if what he was doing for biology as all he had left. He said yes. The high school children in their district were to enroll in all of their classes on some site, and just have at least 80% of each class's coursework done by today. I was contacted by the school today and informed that, apart from biology, he had done *no work whatsoever.* I was *furious.* Not only did he not do any of his work prior to the biology teacher calling me, he had the audacity to *lie* about it!  


He was in his room reading. From the look on his face when i entered the room, I'd say he already knew this was coming. I flew into a rage, asking him repeatedly for what reason he had decided not to do any of his schoolwork. All I got was mumbled ""I don't know""s. He's been on his phone and the Xbox for a considerable amount of time since the shutdown, so of course I took those, but there were also stretches of time where he'd be doing something else, like reading, so there's got to be some other reason and solution I'm not seeing here.

I have to hide my money and bank cards because he has stolen close to $1000 from me. His room is beyond disgusting, it's not just dirty clothes, its dirty dishes, rotting food, he doesn't keep up with the cat he insists he has as a support animal, so the cat pisses on all the clothes on the floor. Most of which, are clean clothes that I just spent $100 to wash everyone's clothes when the washer was broken. I will tell him he needs to clean the room, he will just play games instead of cleaning. So I will change the wifi so he has to clean his room first. It always turns into him crying saying he is suicidal, which only would come up when I was trying to discipline him. He has gone to a mental facility twice, and is in day therapy. He is a cutter as well. His room is a health risk, but if I push him to clean it, he cuts or says he is suicidal. In one of his journal logs at therapy he had even written that he wanted to kill me.

I also have an 18 year old, in high school, that refuses to get a job, and doesn't help with the house work unless I say something. We did have a work contract set up where he would clean the bathroom and take out garbage daily. He wouldn't do it, so I changed the wifi password. His response was he was going to turn himself in for smoking pot. I know now that I should've just called his bluff, but being the caring person I am, on top of the mental and emotional issues that he has, I didn't want that to happen.

I had an abusive marrage, so I was always the overly caring, soft parent. I have tried to be the strong parent, however they just walk all over me and manipulate me now.  If I try to discipline it always ""I'm suicidal"", or ""im willing to throw my life away because im not getting what I want"". 

Now I have a boyfriend that lives with me, he is supportive of me, helps me with the house and bills. He has been there for me more than any other guy I have dated. The boys and him don't get along. He doesn't hit them, he makes sure they have necessities. Yes he has raised his voice at them. He is angry about the way they treat me, and he can't do anything to help, because ""your not my dad,"" and he is the boyfriend, not parent. No, he doesn't interact with them that much, he has also seen the disrespect since the start. The boys want him out of the house because he gets angry with them, and he gets angry because of thier behavior and disrespect.

Edit: the ex husband hasn't been in our lives for 6 years now. The 15 yr old didn't start bringing up thoughts of suicide until he was middle school, after the ex was no longer in our life, and since than would only say anything about it when he was in trouble. He has also dealt with bullying at every school he has been to. His response to bullying is to try and make others think he is a violent bad ass, he is not a violent person. He pushed a bully once, but that is the extent of his violence towards others.  

Him and I have been working closely with his councilors, the social worker at school that has helped us since we moved here, and the crisis line. I'm doing my best to be as supportive as I can. I do believe that he is hurting from everything, it just makes things difficult when the suicide talk only happens when he is in trouble. I've been honest with the boys about how I was as a teen, and things I had done, and what the outcomes where. He went to the facility twice in a month, when he went the second time he added things to what is wrong, he added things that I had done/felt when I was younger to what he is saying he has done/felt. Him saying he wanted to hurt others didn't come up until after I told him how I was. As a teen I was a bitch, I didn't care about anyone, including myself, I was a cutter, I set things on fire, I dropped out of school, and a multitude of other things. I had things happen that made me do a 180, I went from being a bitch to being an over caring doormat that has pretty much put others feelings above my own.

Edit: I sit down with the boys when they are in trouble and talk about what happened, why they felt the need to do it, and what consequences are going to happen because of the behavior. If they are honest there is still a consequence, but if I find out they lied the consequence is a bit more. 

I know I have been too easy with the consequences, after what we have been through I have been as understanding about thier actions as I can.  I'm more of a mediator, conflict and arguing bothers me greatly, I have always felt talking about what's wrong is more productive than just arguing or yelling. Yes, there have been times I have been overwhelmed and raised my voice. Unfortunately, just talking about it, and being too light has contributed to part of the problem because it is hard for me to be stern.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2272963,public,self,Completely lost,0,[],0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/h0nywr/completely_lost/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,1591895666.0,,,,,0,

I'm pretty new to parenting and the only experience I have with kids are young (ex preschool teacher/ early childhood development psychologist). The kid we are both dealing with is 15, and flunking out of school badly. We both offer to help but she lies about homework, we came to the decision to stay in touch with all of her teachers next semester to find out what she actually needs to do so have that somewhat settled. She is extremely spoiled to the point that I'm worried she is going to have a very rough time when she gets older because she can't and won't do anything for herself. She does absolutely nothing around the house and her room is so filthy it's grotesque, so she often takes over the living room even though she has more than she will ever need to entertain herself in her room, and gets it filthy and refuses to clean after herself. Also she is unhealthily overweight and refuses to do anything about it, so I'm worried about her physical and mental health. She says she has depression and refuses to go to therapy, and won't listen to what either has to say about the matter. She also lies to her friends about her home situation because I think she enjoys the attention of being pitied. For some reason she tells them she is somehow abused/ neglected wich is very false, she will tell them she hasn't ate for days   or there is no food in the house, but she refuses to invite them over. My fiance has even been willing to go on vacation &amp; travel in order for her to in my opinion stupidly visit friends she's only met online and I think that could be dangerous for both of them. With all that being said I still care about her daughter regardless of all the stupid stuff she does. And sorry for the blog post, needed to vent.

My husband and I like to go to dinner every Friday night for date night. That has been stopped lately but our city is slowly opening back up and we would like to get back to it. We used to leave the oldest in charge when we went out but he didn't have to actually do much of anything. He would usually just play video games the whole time. My 13 year old is the better babysitter. Granted my nearly 9 year old doesn't need constant supervision but he'll play with her and keep her company. One time he wanted to go to a friend's house but his sister wanted him to stay home and babysit. He decided to stay home, babysit, and then go to his friends after we got home so he could make some money. I thought it was a mature decision. We didn't want to make him stay just because his sister wanted him to babysit but he decided that the money was worth it and stayed a little longer. 

We pay both boys but pay the younger one more because he does more work. He's the one playing outside with her, helping her make a snack, playing board games, putting on a movie, etc. The oldest just goes to the computer, puts his headphones on, and tells his siblings to let him know if the house is on fire or if someone needs an ambulance. Other than that he doesn't do anything but he thinks he deserves as much money as his brother. I don't want to treat them unfairly but I feel like I am paying them for their effort they put in. I don't want this to come across the wrong way but my older one almost never leaves the house so it's not like he's giving up a night with friends to keep an eye on his sister and we don't even make him do it. If he wanted to be completely free of responsibilities and wanted his sister with another babysitter then we would do that but he wouldn't be getting paid. He wants the money but puts in minimal effort. The 13 year old likes to hang out with friends so he does sometimes wait to hang out with friends until he's done babysitting if he wants the money.

I could try to make excuses but I'm not going to. For 12 years I paid child support but was never there. 3 years ago I found her mom after loosing her number. I've been building a relationship since then.  I live in Wisconsin. My daughter lives with the step dad in Washington because her moms a mess. 

With our relationship becoming better we have been talking a lot. We were having the occasional 2 hour conversation. About a month ago I noticed weird stuff. First was when he forced her to stay still so he could shave her head. He did it to her sister too. That seemed like a asshole thing to do but I didn't think much about it. 

Little things cought my attention but I dont remember them.  Tiny little remarks basically. When all the riots started my daughter went out into woods on the step dads property with some friends. They were doing teenage girl talk stuff and the step dad decided to go spy on them and listen to them.  That's odd but that's not what concerned me. He brought a loaded gun with him and fired a few rounds to scare them.  As a gun owner myself this cought my attention and scared me. You don't use guns as a joke.  

Fast forward to last week. Wednesday night I only get 15 minutes with my daughter because of ""phone issues"" on the dads phone. She tells me she was hit a few times and her head bounced off the wall every time. If she didn't answer his questions ""he had another side of the face to use"" that's what was apparently said.

Thursday I didn't do anything. Friday morning I called cps. I was concerned and had questions. I'm on the other side of the US but this is starting to really bother me. It sounds horrible for her.

Friday night we have a good talk. She really opens up and we talk about her step dad. Physical abuse is not normal but he will back her into a corner when yelling at her. The more ""normal"" abuse is mental. She's not his daughter so she's told constantly that she is not as good as them. He won't allow her to learn to drive or do college type classes. She's possibly open to moving here. She would miss her siblings but she hates it there.

Monday cps showed up at his home. I guess I should of expected that but I didn't at all. Now I can't get a hold of her and according to the step dad she told the cps people that she has no interest in moving here. 

At this point I'm feeling lost. Not really sure what to do. Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Edit: apparently a kid saying they are getting beat and abused holds no legal ground in Washington. Cool. Not really something I wanted to hear but I called a lawyer for help since I'm clueless about this stuff.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2268490,public,self,I'm really not sure what to do.,0,[],0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/gzrjgj/im_really_not_sure_what_to_do/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,1591726683.0,,,,,0,

She will be fifteen this fall.

Her dad washed his hands of her a long time ago.  He was not a good person, AT ALL.  He abused our son.  However, he made some accurate observations about our daughter that I ignored until recently.  

He kind of just disappeared after the divorce and started a new family within a month with a new wife and two step kids.  At first he took about half of his visitation but lost it in part because of how they treated my daughter.  

Every time she was with them she was very combative, understandably.  Their stepmother acted like she cared but would send messages through my ex husband that she didn’t want to deal with the harder aspects of parenting when it came to our children (for instance, my daughter got lice EVERY TIME she went over there but they didn’t want to have to comb it out.  They refused to buy her a toothbrush during one visit because “that’s what child support is for.”  Her stepmother wouldn’t wash her clothes so my daughter got an infection from dirty undies. 

First was the anger.  Constant anger.  I chalked it up to trauma and the divorce.  She would say incredibly nasty, hurtful, personal things to everyone, like telling her brother who had attempted suicide that she wished he’d been successful.

Then came the acting out.  She said she would do ANYTHING for attention and she certainly did.  Acting out sexually, behaviorally, etc.  In a school of 2,000 children she became “the” problem child.

Their step dad arrived on the scene about four years ago.  He saw what was going on from the very beginning and wasn’t deterred.  He has loved them fiercely since day one.  There was a learning curve as he had never been a parent, and he and our daughter have very similar personalities and clash a lot.  He would previously lose his temper when she would get really nasty but has done a ton of work in therapy to fix that.  

We are a sex positive family that holds strong beliefs about self improvement and believe in taking care of your mental health.  We take things very seriously when one of our kids has a problem.  

We were not happy when she began acting out sexually without proper protection.  We took her to the pediatrician to have the doctor back us up.  She scoffed anyhow.  

She started running away from school claiming to be in a fugue state or having panic attacks but it came out later these were maybe faked.

She has either refused to continue with every therapist she has seen or they ‘fire’ her.  Her last one said he thinks the only solution is a wilderness program.

She got on some anti depressants which  helped a bit for a while.  Her psychiatrist watched very calmly as my daughter threw a temper tantrum in her office, slamming her head against the wall, pulling her hair and screaming profanities.  She told her the meds would help, if she would give them a chance.  

Even with the meds though, she is mad at everyone all the time.  It is someone new every day.  Some new issue every day.  But she is never at peace with everyone in the house.  

Every time I ask her to do something she explodes and argues with me and starts a fight.  She is constantly screaming at her brother. 

If any of us makes a mistake, no matter how small, it is held against us and as she says “she doesn’t accept apologies.”  She said that she doesn’t want to live with people who keep making mistakes, sometimes the same mistakes.  I told her that people usually struggle along the same lines consistently and that she would be unlikely to find people in life who would never repeat a mistake or made a new one daily.  (To give an example, her brother talks too much, or I am too sensitive, etc as an example of mistakes that won’t change.  Nobody is yelling at her or beating her or anything.)  One family member has been really stressed recently and is being a little short with everyone.  He apologizes when he realizes it.  But she says we should all just STOP making mistakes.

Her dad and I are in counseling and read parenting and self help books and are working through shortcomings we have.  We aren’t ones to stay stagnant in a bad place.  We aren’t perfect parents but we are pretty good ones.

Her anger and attitude has made it almost impossible for us to spend quality time with her, even individually.  She and her stepdad have things they do together, then she and her brother, she and I.  We try to make it so that everyone in the house gets one on one time with everyone else so bonds will be strong.  We also make sure the kids get plenty of time with friends and alone, as well as family time.  

She talks to us about anything, bursts into our room in the middle of the night to talk to us, seems to enjoy the hobbies we do together, but most of the time is just so cruel.  

Last night her dad and I were planning an at home date night and had spent an hour trying to order our food and wrangling our other kids.  As soon as we were about to leave to pick it up, she says that our oldest son has a HUGE issue with us and that she feels neglected and that nobody is communicating or spending enough time together and could we cancel our date night and hang out?  The night before we had played a board game.  We canceled our food order and called our son down who said he didn’t have a problem with us at all.  (He is open when he does so we didn’t press it.)  He had to end a live match with friends on Xbox  to come down and was frustrated with her but we all talked and decided on a dinner plan to share together and then decided to watch a show together.  Once all the plans were in motion, she decided she had changed her mind, but it was too late to change anything.  She sat down here pouting for 45 minutes then went upstairs.  Between her outburst, changing all the dinner plans, the talk, getting the little ones settled, etc it was almost midnight and so her dad and I needed to go to bed and we didn’t get to have our time together.

Family time is always so awful. I hate to say it but we dread spending time with her now.  She ruins every activity.  Board games, movies, everything.  We were struggling to find something to do together that wouldn’t cause a fight.  If we offer two board game suggestions, for instance, she will wait for someone to else to speak up first then say “Ew no, I want the other one.”  It is that way about EVERYTHING.  That’s one of the reasons it took so long to order the family dinner last night.

So her dad and I were discussing options for family time that could avoid fights, avoid more screen time, etc.  I remembered that everyone had loved the Harry Potter movie marathon we had done and we agreed that it would be fun if we would start reading the books out loud as a family.  

We called the kids down for it tonight but didn’t tell them why.  I was so so excited.  She saw the book in my hand and flew off the handle, saying that “I better not think I was going to make her listen to me read a book.”  I calmly told her that I was.  Everyone got settled and I started to read and she hopped up and just marched out of the house.  When she came back in, I told her that was unacceptable.  She started to get angry and say that this wasn’t right or fair and that she shouldn’t be forced to be with the family or do something that she didn’t want to do.  Her brother put a blanket over his head which has become his go-to when she starts to rant.  

I asked her why she is so angry and what her issue with reading was.  I asked her why she is so unkind to everyone.  I told her that she is doing serious damage to relationships she would have forever and that I was concerned that between this and the way she treats friends and romantic partners that she would end up alone and sad and that I didn’t want that for her.  I said  that we are not perfect but that we are the only parents she’s got.  

She said “Actually I have two more.” And gives me the nastiest look.  This other woman has spent one week total, MAYBE with my daughter in her whole life, and that would be a stretch.  She wouldn’t stop her car if she saw my daughter dying on the side of the road.

I told my daughter to stop acting like a b*****.  (I know, I know.)  I was so incredibly hurt and mad.  Our oldest son is about to turn 18 and the fact that family time is always ruined with so little time left with some of my kids is weighing on me.  

Now I feel completely lost and like a terrible mother.  I feel as though the whole family is being held hostage constantly by a tiny terrorist.

My boyfriend has taken the role of parent as well and is helping to raise her but he is extremely laid back and I've only ever heard him yell twice in the 13 years I've known him.

I am the only one who deals with it and he always believes there's a lesson to be taught rather than punishing her. Yesterday she was screaming in my face and being extremely rude and he just sat there. Today I was on the phone with her mother and we were teasing her because she was flipping out about having to eat hard tacos instead of soft. He told me I was antagonizing her.

My older daughter, 14, is a total extrovert, and made friends immediately. She and her friend (who is a very nice girl, no trouble, good grades, etc) asked to be dropped off at the beach. I said no, but that I would bring them to the beach and sit a distance away to give them their privacy. We weren’t there but 20 minutes and a young man, about their age, stopped at their blanket and started talking to them. I assumed it was someone from school, and kept an eye out. I watched him follow them to the water and back, at which time I texted my daughter and asked if everything was ok. She said the guy was annoying but fine. Time went on and he didn’t leave. My daughter finally texted me “Mom, could you get this guy to leave us alone? He’s really creeping us out.” I went over there and almost immediately my daughter’s friend said, “Can we (meaning she, my daughter, and the creeper kid) leave the beach and go get snow cones??” I said no, and basically told the kid to get lost, which he did. I spoke to the girls right then, and also more in depth in the car on the way home later. Both girls, my daughter and the friend, confirmed that they felt uncomfortable, and didn’t want this kid around. I asked the friend why on earth she was offering to leave the beach with someone she felt uncomfortable with?!?! She couldn’t give me an answer, and finally just said she didn’t know how to say no without hurting his feelings, and didn’t want a confrontation. 

This happened a couple days ago and I just can’t shake the sick feeling that this little girl was going to leave with a person she didn’t feel comfortable with just to avoid hurting his feelings, or to avoid a scene.

So, my (40f) partner's (40m) son who JUST turned 16 is seeing a woman who is 25. I'm not sure what to think of this, but I'm pretty uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to feel or what to do (if anything). The kid (James) is mature I suppose, as mature as a freshly-turned 16 year old can be. and I don't know the woman (Kecia) but I did see her at his 16th birthday party (that she came was weird in itself, and she did not talk to any of the parents).  James's mom knows her a bit and described her as 'grounded'. We heard that this relationship was forming recently and my partner was pretty shocked and so was I. I feel it's inappropriate. James's mom seems to be fine with it, she did use the term 'good' like maybe it's good for him. I think 'good' is a stretch. My partner has said the same thing too but he is uncomfortable with it generally, even though it will probably run it's course soon and everything will be fine. And I know we can't stop them from seeing each other. So what to do? 

I don't know if my past experience is influencing my feelings. I know there's a huge difference between boys and girls, that girls are more at risk of abuse, but I know it can go both ways, and there is a pretty big power dynamic between a teenager and an adult no matter what the gender. I have had a lot of bad relationship experiences when I was younger, I dated a 28 y/o when I was 18 and it was definitely not good. I also, full disclosure, was smooching with an 18 y/o briefly when I was 28, but felt sleeping with him would be wrong, and definitely wouldn't go hang around his parents!!!  

 I'm feeling pretty protective of the kid. I'm struggling with wanting to contact Kecia and ask her what she's doing, and what her intentions are having a relationship with someone who's barely legal, but I don't know if that's out of line. They are fully having sleepovers, we just found out last night.  I'm concerned about the kiddo. I don't know if James's mom has spoken to the kid or Kecia (I texted her but haven't heard back, and we are on good terms). My partner is a zombie from doing university online so he doesn't really have the space to deal with it.  James will be here on Monday and I am definitely going to sit down with him for a serious talk about relationships - he is a total clam when it comes to talking about relationships, he's had numerous 'girlfriends' so far (nothing like this though) and apparently has been having sex since he was 13 - but I don't care if he sits there staring at the floor the whole time, if he's going to be in an adult relationship he's going to have to start acting like one and communicating and being a healthy human. It feels like he's gone from 15 to 20 all of a sudden! But he is still a child and still needs parenting.

I was so freaking naive as time passed he became bitter over his own failures started blaming me and slowly his abuse started getting worse until he dropped me like a bad habit.

I was more devastated than I ever thought was possible and I swore I'd never let myself be that powerless again so I used the skills I had and it took a few years but I made a sizable business in the sex industry.

I did the right thing, asked my then girlfriend (she was also 20 at the time) to marry me, and thus here I am with an 18-year-old. Now my daughter, Lauren, has always loved her daddy. And when I was growing up, since my father never gave me attention, I acted out in school, and always got in trouble. But when Lauren was born, she just jumped on my stomach over and over and I loved every minute of it. And as a 18-year-old, she's never had a boyfriend. Not to say she's ugly, she's actually a pretty girl, but I'm 90% sure she's asexual. She was always focused on academics and her favorite hobby is reading.

When Lauren was 3, our second daughter Lily was born. And one thing both girls always had in common is, how awesome Dad is. Hell, Lily used to text me every day for the last two years, from randomly shooting me middle finger emojis, just to say how her day was going. Lily and I would go to comic book conventions together, anime conventions, those types of things. It was like as if you separated my personality, both daughters had something. Lauren (x-files fan) - Lily (Naruto fan). Side note, for the past 6 years, I've been working out of state. I'm only home Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday.

Now both girls are my rocks. The reasons I get up in the morning, go to work, and bring home cash. Here's my problem: As stupid as it sounds, I feel like I'm losing both of my daughters. Lauren is going off to college, to a different state across the continent, and Lily has found herself a boyfriend. Those text now are non-existent. And since I'm only home on the weekends, I feel like all of Lily's attention is going to Mom. I understand Lily is at that age where she can't talk to dad about this boy, or sex talk (trust me, I do not want that) or other mom-type issues. But it still sucks. One example of something that sucked is, Lily just turned 15 this past May. And she was excited about doing the driving lessons I promised. So, I took her driving so she could her learners permit and we had a blast. This past weekend, I home and Lily was like, ""Yep. Mom's been taking me driving. You don't have to worry about it anymore."" When I asked the wife about that, Wife said, ""You got her excited about driving and she begged me to take her. What was I supposed to do?""

And another thing was, I had the first awkward silence I've ever felt with her. While out shopping, she stretched and I noticed she is almost at ab level. I said, ""Wow, have you been working out?"" She froze, giving me the deer in headlights look. I found this strange because I begged her to come with me to the gym last summer and she mostly refused. Then she said, ""I don't feel comfortable telling you that."" I'm like, what?! Man, she could have said I'm doing sit-ups and I would have shrugged it off. But, man that was rough for me. I don't know, I'm really struggling with this. It's actually kept me up at night because I know this was bound to happen, but I was just not prepared for it. I'm not going to hold them back, it just sucks losing them. I feel so pathetic.

My mom was big on always having more than one kid because it's not fair for a child to grow up lonely, so that's why I thought two was the magical number. I had a son first, and when he was three his sister was born. As a child he was mainly just neutral towards her, he didn't bother much with her and left her on her own. I would always try to get him to play with her but whenever she cried he'd walk away and he just didn't seem to care for her. Now they're 13F and 16M. 

When they grew up it became pretty clear that she literally adored him. She'd ask his opinion on everything and copy all of his interests (he was a baseball player so she asked to join up too, he likes video games so she asked for a PlayStation, the books and movies he likes so does she) and pretty much idolized him.

He, on the other hand, seemed to care for her less and less. He loved playing baseball outside with his father in the yard and she insisted to join in and his dad was happy to let her, but as soon as she started playing he walked away. We figured it'd be fair for him to get his own time with his dad so his dad talked to her and said how about they play baseball themselves in an hour, he just wants to spend time with her brother first. She wasn't happy about it and refused, but finally ended up relenting and it went back to him and his dad playing. 

We're just not sure what to do at this point. He's her hero, but he doesn't seem to give a shit about her. She's always asking him what he thinks of this, and if he wants to throw around a ball with her, but he literally always says no. About five or six months ago, he started a new thing where he just started ignoring her. Like he wouldn't talk to her at all unless she spoke to him and even then he'd pretend not to hear her until she'd come up in front of him and make it clear she was talking to him.

I don't get it, and I don't get what to do. Our 13-year-old is heartbroken and keeps on asking us why he won't spend time with her and we have no idea what caused this, and why there's this one-sided hatred.

I am white.  We moved to North Carolina last year from Texas.  Four months ago, he started working at his first job at a fast food place.  He plans on going to college after he graduates high school, so he is not trying to build a future or anything but we were all hoping it would be a good experience for him.

Tonight he came home wide-eyed and he said he wanted to talk to me about something.  He has a manager at work that he has told me before that he feels like the guy does not like him.  He did not know why so I told him to just keep working hard and not worry about it.  He said that tonight when he was leaving, the manager called to him, “You no work tomorrow?” and was acting like my son did not speak English.  (Sadly, my son does not speak a lick of Spanish other than what he has learned in high school Spanish classes).  The manager was mocking him and making fun of him and two other young people that work there were laughing at him, too.

He said he was caught off guard because he has never had anyone talk like that to him before.  He said he was not upset about it and that he did not care but I know it bothered him some.

He has already been talking about eventually looking for a different job, but now he really wants to find another one.  He does not have to have a job, but he of course likes having a little spending money for things he wants and he has saved over $2000.00.  

Here is my question where I need some advice:  How do I stop myself from confronting his manager?  I know it would be a bad idea but I am really upset.

I have 3 boys (11, 14, and 18) from prior relationships and she has two girls and a boy.  We met when the girls were in their early to mid teen years.  Her oldest has left the house and now all we've got are my three boys and her 18 year old daughter.

To say that dealing with teenage girls is a shock to the system would be an understatement.  For the most part, when the girls have acted up I've tried to take it in stride.  Sometimes one succeeded, sometimes I haven't.  My problem is not taking it personally.  I don't like having my feelings hurt and it just seems like teenage girls can be so vicious sometimes 

Here's the problem - - if anyone ever tells my step-daughter that she hurt their feelings, she goes ballistic.  She'll yell, claim that HER feelings were hurt (presumably by virtue of being told she hurt someone's feelings?), and then alternate between attacking and silent treatment.

Here's a wrinkle - - my boys and I are highly intelligent.  Their mom and I are lawyers.  Which means the boys have superior language, critical thinking, and argument skills.  I'm not saying this to brag.  It's just the reality of two lawyers raising children.  My step-daughter has confessed to my wife that she is intimated by our intellect and she feels stupid in comparison. I don't see her as stupid at all and I've made sure to express that I'm proud of her and that she has the ability to do anything she wants in this world.  My boys and I never talk down to her.  We are cognizant and respectful of the insecurity.

The problem I'm having are these emotional outbursts.  You can't talk to her when it happens because she will simply never relent.  Ever.  She digs her heels in so deeply.  To top it off, her father abandoned her maybe 8 years ago.  So I don't know if there's also some latent resentment by virtue of our gender. 

I just have no idea how to handle this.  Personally, I just leave her alone to have her tantrums.  But when she comes hunting people down for a fight while we're talking in the living room, it's a real challenge.

Lately, I've been seeing signs that make me concerned.  Her anxiety levels are very high.  She's afraid to sleep in her room at night because she thinks someone might break in.  She's begun washing her hands way too often.  It's at the point that her hands look severely dried out.  We're a Catholic family and she's grown up in the church but lately she seems to have an unhealthy relationship with her faith.  She is very worried that she isn't good enough to go to heaven and she has started mentioning kind of weird things that she thinks might be a sin.  For example, the other day she asked me to read the bible with her but she wouldn't read it until she had clean hands because she was worried that reading the bible with dirty hands would be a sin.  We had an ice cream treat a few days ago and I noticed that she didn't eat very much of it.  I wasn't thinking anything about her anxiety but I just mentioned that I was shocked that she didn't want her ice cream (because normally she would have eaten every bite).  At first she kind of just shrugged me off but later she came up to me and asked me if I thought it was a sin for her to eat the ice cream.  We talked about it and I asked her why she would think it was a sin and she couldn't really explain.  There have been a few other strange things like that.

But, you can hear conversations if you’re passing by. It’s 4 AM and I was in the kitchen getting some water and my night owl (almost) 16-year-old son is on a group chat with a bunch of friends. I don’t normally even pay attention to his conversations but something caught my ear, and it was the topic of them dropping one of their (ex)friends because he has shown racist tendencies recently, and also made some pretty outrageous comments on social media about the current protests and movements. I am black and my kids’ dad is white. I am divorced, and my fiancé is white. My kids grew up never seeing color *at home*. And to be honest, all three of my children have a beautiful melting pot of friends. So many different races, cultures...such truly beautiful people. I love my kids’ friends. So, hearing my son engaged in this conversation with his friends about race, and the ongoing movement, and what it means to them and how they feel...I am truly thankful that they have each other to talk to about everything. That they have outlets to share and it never ends in bickering or fighting. They hear each other out and explain opinions but they all love each other. And I guess they’re not afraid to shut someone down that is behaving in a way that they find inappropriate. I wish they didn’t have to deal with this at such a young age. But I guess it is something that will be a part of the world, no matter how hard we try to make changes. I have my own stories of what I’ve experienced, but that’s for another post another time. I’m 38 and I have three absolutely amazing teenagers. I had them at a young age, and I raised them as I was growing up in a different world. I don’t know if it is naïve or not, but I never really thought they would be seeing and hearing the things that they are in the news and media that are so racially fueled, prompting them to examine their own ideals so early in life. Everything affecting the world right now is just crushing my heart and tearing my soul. It devastates me to see our country in such a state of disorder and pain.

I'm looking for some perspective, maybe even a sanity check. I'm 39, my wife is 35, for the purposes of this post I have three kids (15, 13, and 10). I have two others but they live with their mom in another state (they visit for a couple of months during the summer and a few weeks during the winter). 

I work in the military and when I get told that I need to work somewhere, I go and work there. My family can come with me in most cases. In this case, it wound up taking my family from one end of the country to the other (more or less, CO to VA). My 15 year old was in the middle of a relationship during that time. She considers herself dating the boy in CO while she's in VA.  
We've been here for about a year now. She keeps bringing up that she wants to visit her boyfriend in CO. She claims that his parents are perfectly okay with hosting her while she visits for a week or two during summer vacation. My wife and I are not okay with this prospect. We are not okay with her flying on her own to see a boyfriend. It....just seems like flimsy reason to sponsor a trip just to make my daughter happy.

I'm okay with all kinds of other options. The boy's family comes and visits, they can take in the DC monuments. I can't think of a reason to back to CO for any reason. I have some military friends there but I don't have time to visit anyone whenever I want. I'm okay with a trip to Disneyland (or some theme park) for the family and the boy visits with us. Or some other vacation-y thing that the entire family enjoys and the side benefit for 15 year old is that she sees her boyfriend.

   I don't know this boy's parents though. I know his dad is in the military and that's about it. I don't know anything about the mom except from what my wife tells me. The kids mom really wants to be the 'cool' mom is the impression I get. I don't really care if that is how she wants to do her stuff, I don't think I'm very strict by any sense of the word when it comes to my parenting style. This whole request seems more like a request to remove my brains from my head and throw them on the ground.  
My daughter herself hasn't been exactly a shining beacon of trust and responsibility, she comes off as a fairly average teen, to me at least. I wasn't that much better growing up and that is the only comparison I really have. I would not have trusted 15 year old me to fly across the states to visit with a girlfriend. That isn't her experience though. My wife's perspective is that the boyfriend's parents are not okay with their son traveling the country on his own, so why in the world would my wife allow our daughter to travel. That makes sense too.  
So, sanity check, am I crazy for thinking that it is irresponsible to allow my daughter to travel the country on her own to visit her boyfriend with parents that I don't know? So far, I don't think so.   
   How should I express this to my teen without tearing her down or crushing her hopes. I don't want to give any kind of false promise. My wife seems to think that my approach is fairly abrasive and not empathetic so I'm not trying to get into it. Wife seems to portray what I'm thinking and feeling without being so blunt with people.

It is about an hour away. I have some concerns. The biggest one being that my husband has a rare medical disorder and we are unsure how he would be affected by Covid. Our state was hit pretty hard. The idea of the kids being near thousands of people worries me even if everyone is wearing a mask. My second concern is for their safety. I have heard about these protest getting out of hand and I don't want them to get hurt. My 18 year old argues that if this happened while she was away at school then I wouldn't even know if she protested because she goes to college on the other side of the country. I get that but if she was still away at school she wouldn't be bringing her 15 year old brother with her nor would she be risking bringing home something her dad. Both kids say they can quarantine at my daughter's biological dad's house after the protest and, while I know he wouldn't mind, I really don't want to be unable to see my kids for 2 weeks. 

I am not concerned about their reasons for wanting to do it.

She won't go outside and play by herself and although we have a huge lawn, there is nothing for her to do out there all alone. But when I am finally done with work for the day I have to immediately go into the kitchen and start getting dinner ready then spend the evening cooking and cleaning.

I always hope it just plays out. I know teenagers are figuring out themselves and the world and do dumb stuff. I don’t want to embarrass her. 

As long as I can remember she has been creating these “things” to try to get attention. She very rarely does them around us, only at school. Like for a while she pretended she was clumsy. So she’d fall constantly. A few months later she was magically cured and then she was terrified of everything. If there was a noise she’d jump and audibly react and throw herself around like it was the scariest thing ever.  She was the girl that cries all the time for a while. She isn’t clumsy. She isn’t easily startled. She doesn’t cry constantly. And at home these things didn’t happen.

It seemed for a while like she stopped doing these things and now she suddenly has a stutter or speech impediment or something. I don’t know what to call it. She will be talking and say “Can I bo b b b b b b b b orrow your pen p p p p p p p p p p encil?” And she’ll tilt her head and act like she’s struggling. But she isn’t. It’s fake. She’s healthy. She has never had speech issues. It’s one of her fake “things.”

I never say anything because I don’t want to bring attention to it. And I’m not concerned about the actions being real and her needing a doctor because they are clearly fake. (She isn’t exactly good at pretending these things.)

Since everything is shut down she was having to do her classes over video and I would hear her fake stuttering. I know everyone has moments where their brain just sort of hiccups but they move on. So I figured it was that. Then I started realizing it was constant when she was on these video sessions. But she’d come out and talk to us and it wouldn’t happen. Until she realized I’d heard her. Now it’s all the damn time. And you can almost see her planning it when she talks to us. But she’ll go in her room and be hanging out with a sibling and it won’t happen. 

I know for a fact it’s that fake crap she does.

Would you ignore it? Or would you say something?

I usually lean towards ignoring it but she just started working. And now all I can think is she’s at this new job and acting like she can’t speak. Having an employee that “can’t” talk to customers isn’t exactly something an employer is going to deal with.

Ok, this is going to be long because there's a lot of back story. Here goes:

I've been with my partner for 6 years, living together for 4 and a half. I have two boys (13 and 11) from a previous relationship, he has one boy (now 15) that I will call John for the purpose of this post.

When we met I shared 50/50 custody with my ex - which is still the case - and we have a very amicable arrangement and are friendly towards each other. He, on the other hand had a very toxic relationship with his ex and she had custody and lived in a small town 2 hours away. He had his boy every second weekend. When we met this arrangement had been going on for 18 months. Before that he shared 50/50 custody and although he and his ex didn't get on that well, they were civil and the custody arrangement was going well.

What changed was she decided she wanted a fresh start with her new partner and baby and got a job transfer to this new town and wanted to take John (then 9) with her. My partner was against this and a very nasty and bitter court custody battle ensued, which she won.

Previous to having John, my partner and his ex had a very volatile relationship. They were both drug users, heavy drinkers and there was abuse and terrible behaviour on both sides. When I met my partner he had cleaned up his act a lot, was not using drugs, was totally non violent but still drank quite a lot. Now, 6 years later he is a light drinker and a much happier person.

During the custody battle, there was a lot of mud slung from both sides and John was subject to hearing both of his parents bad mouth the other one and was exposed to things no child should be exposed to. He was caught in a tug of war and I believe that's where the trouble started.

When John was 12 he expressed and interest to us that he wanted to come and live with us and do High School in the city. He was coming out as gay, was/is very creative and a little flamboyant and was getting bullied at his school. He thought a bigger city with a high school that put emphasis on things like drama and music would suit him and we agreed. Also, over the 2 and a half years I had known him he had been telling us quite concerning things about his home life. For example, his mother had 3 different partners in the space of 2 years that she moved in with - one of them was a white supremacist, which horrified us, she ended up having to get a restraining order against him; she didn't get up in the morning to get John or his sister off to school; she lost her job due to one of her partners trying to sell drugs to her clients. We really wanted to get him out of there but knew a court case would be expensive and not necessarily go in our favour.

My partner asked his ex if John could come and live with us and she point blank refused. She claimed he didn't want to and we were putting words in his head and trying to poison him against her.

Eventually we decided we had to go ahead with a court case to try and get custody as we were really concerned about his home life. After putting in the application to the court the judge ordered us to have a mediation to try and work it out first.

Needless to say, this didn't work and was the worst experience of my life. My partner's ex is the most toxic, derranged and impossible person I've ever met who is more interested in fighting and winning than what is best for her child. The mediator could not control her at all - at one point she was leaning over the table pointing her finger in my face while screaming at me. After that mediation we decided we did not have the mental fortitude to carry on with a court case. We did come to one agreement. That after another year had passed if John was still saying he wanted to come and live with us, he could. Neither of us had any faith that would happen.

That mediation happened in January of 2018. In February of that year I was away working when my partner called my at 9.30 on a wednesday night and told me that he had had a call from the police station in the town where John lived saying John was at the police station, was refusing to go home to his mother and could my partner come and pick him up. He was understandably stressed and couldn't actually go and get him as my two boys were in bed asleep.

John had walked to the police station and told them his mother and her partner were off their heads on prescription drugs and alcohol and had been driving John and his sister around. The police went to check on them and found they were wasted. Apparently John had been withholding information about just how bad his mother was, but she was totally addicted to prescription pills and alcohol.

By the time we figured out somewhere he could stay the night (a friend of an acquaintance) it was nearly midnight. The next day my partner drove to pick him up and put in an urgent custody application to the court which was accepted and voila, we had John living with us. The whole thing was extremely stressful but we were glad to have him out of there and with us.

He was enrolled in school and we got him some counselling sessions and he seemed to be going great, but we were both prepared for something down the track as a kid doesn't go through something like that and turn out unscathed.

For two years everything was peaceful, except John didn't see his mother for a year and she sent him some pretty nasty emails. Then they picked up contact and he would see her from time to time and she seemed to be being an ok mother but still never apologised to him and had the nerve to say that he owed her an apology!

So he was going along at school well, he was learning piano and was generally a happy and polite kid. He was making friends and would hang out with them after school, although he never brought any friends home (even though we asked him to) so we never met any.

At the beginning of this year he started spending way more time in his room but we figured that's normal for a teenager. He really only came out of his room for food but he still always seemed happy and we did check in on his mental state from time to time, and he always said he was fine.

In Feb of this year we discovered he had been cutting himself. He broke down and said he had bad thoughts in his head and he thought he needed help. We comforted him, said it was normal and that we would get him help. I was looking for a suitable counsellor and found an online psyhcologist that had great reviews and he started the sessions.

Then we discovered that he had been missing school - like a lot of school. He had only been to about 3 classes in the past two weeks. When we confronted him he became agitated and said he 'couldn't deal with us' and he was going for a walk. After an hour we were a bit concerned and my partner went looking for him but didn't see him. It was getting dark and we were getting worried. He then texted saying he needed to see his mother and she was driving down from her town and he was going to stay with her at her parents (who live in our city) for a few days. We said ok, becasue what else could we do? He kept missing school though and we received a barrage of txts from her saying our parenting clearly wasn't working and she was going to report us blah blah blah. We ignored them. John said he would come back after a couple of days but then kept saying he was staying another night and still not going to school. It was very frustrating as short of going over there and dragging him back there was nothing we could do. We made a meeting with the school and John promised he would start going to classes again, but he wasn't ready to come home. He started to go to one class a day. After being with his grandparents for about 10 days he came home. Basically the grandparents didn't want him there and his mum had gone back to her town so I guess he thought he should come home. He walked in the door and burst into tears and we just hugged him and said it was all ok. The the lockdown was announced to start on 20th March. Lockdown was a blessing - he was doing his schoolwork online, he was going for walks, he was doing he psychology sessions and he said he was feeling great. He said he was looking forward to going to school and that it was going to be a great term. He said he wanted to try being a rebel but it wasn't really him and he wanted to go back to being his normal self. We were so relieved.

Schools where I am (not in the US) started back on the 18th May.

On the Friday before school was due to start he went into town to meet some friends (they were desperate to hook up after lockdown was lifted). He was happy and in a good mood. He said goodbye to me and that he'd be back in the evening as they were going to have dinner together.

About 6.30 he texted to say he was going to stay the night with one of his friends. We said, ok, but we need the number of the parent in charge (which is one of our rules if he stays over somewhere, and he knows that). He said he'd get it soon but 30 minutes passed and no number. We then get a call from someone who is clearly a child pretending to be an adult to say John could stay at her house. Of course we didn't fall for that and texted John to say he better either get a parents number or come home. Neither happened. The next day, my partner rang him t see where he was and for him to come home. He said he wasn't coming home and wanted to spend the night at his grandparents. We said ok, because again, what else can you do? On the Sunday we rang him to say we expected him home by 5pm as he had school the next day. He said he wanted to spend another night with his grandparents.

We were getting pissed off with him by this stage - he had no clothes with him, no toothbrush, no school books and we wanted him home! He point blank refused. My partner rang the grandparents (who are just as horrible as his mother) and said we were not giving him permission to stay the night.

They must have told him he couldn't stay because we then got a message from him saying he was 'helping a friend with schoolwork' and was going to stay there. My partner was apoplectic by then and we told him that he needed to get his arse home pronto.

He refused and said he would be home Monday after school and he would take the consequences.

We couldn't believe what this kid was doing. The next day he got home about 5.30 after school.

He said nothing but 'I'm going to my room"". I said, ok, but you're losing your phone as a consequence of what you've done this weekend and he just said 'no, you're not taking it'.

A pretty big argument ensued, with him refusing to give up his phone or explain his actions. He said 'I'm going for a walk"", we said, 'like hell, last time you went for a walk you didn't come home for 10 days, you can stay in here and think about things.

We left him in his room to think about what he wanted to happen.

5 minutes later he walked downstairs with a backpack and said he wanted to go and live with his grandparents and they were on their way to pick him up. I tried to block the door but after a while we just had to let him go. It was shit and we still don't understand why.

That was 8 days ago and he hasn't been going to school or contacting us.

My partner rang mental health services to see if we can get him an appointment and somehow they had on their records that he was brought home by the police back in march when he was staying at the grandparents the first time for being drunk and naked in the middle of the road. We didn't even know he was drinking. The f\*cking grandparents didn't feel the need to tell us this.

Now he is posting all over instagram videos of him smoking and vaping. He has a boyfriend we know nothing about and basically has turned into a different person.

We are super worried about him but also really pissed off!

If you got to the end you are my hero.

What can we do? We live in New Zealand btw.

I am most likely going to attend private school because of my interests and needs. My brother however willing choose to go to public school because he is able to study what he wants because the program fits him and he is fine with the school being rusty. My brother and I are inseparable and we do everything together. We are very different people but we are best friends and never argue. He loves cars, tanks, video games and loves science and technology to the point that he would just randomly talk about some complicated facts and theories. I am completely opposite. I am the as girly as girly can be. I love learning new languages and reading.I play piano and won awards for singing, I passed the audition for the best acting school in my country. I can’t do math to save my life just like my brother doesn’t know to draw anything other then a stick man. We always knew that one day we will both separate ways in life, I just didn’t think that it would come so soon. The private school that I am lucky my parents are able and willing to pay for is able to give me the education of my dreams. I assumed that my brother would go as well. I am the dominant twin. We always do things my way. I tried to make him consider my school but he is set on public and I would feel horrible if he gave up the school he prefers and fits him because of me. He knows that I am thinking of not going to the private school because we would be separated and I know that he would feel bad if I chose nit to go because of him. Our schools will have different schedules and we would barely see each other half of the school days. We planned to study abroad and rent an apartment together that we would together pay off and then stay in the same country doing our own things. I am set on living in France or England while he is actually thinking about staying in our country or going to Germany. The country that we both agreed on was Italy when we discussed college. This is our first time choosing different paths and being separated. We do everything together and never argue always having each other’s back no matter what. We expected this. We are two completely different people with different interests, dreams and goals. Now it’s school, but in few years we might live in different countries. We promised each other that we will follow our dreams but we will always be there for each other and stay best friends. We know that if if we choose the same path one will be miserable and then is out of the question. I think that this is where our shared road ends and we go our separate ways.

He's a C-student for the most part, unmotivated.  Starts high school next year.  We went to the local vocational school open house, it seemed like a good fit and he seemed interested.  He got accepted, and theattitude just changed to a hard ""I don't want to go, nothing is interesting to me there""

   Maybe he will turn it around, but college just feels like a long shot at this point, so the vocational path seems like such a better option.  It fees like the vocational school is safest, hedging for the future.  But he's adamant about not going, and I have tried over and over to sell it.  If you have a teenager, I don't have to tell you how well those conversations went.  But despite my own belief that it would be better for him in the long run, I'm extremely hesitant to take away his choice.

   His mother thinks we should just accept the invitation and make him go.  I see it as a waste of time, it will build resentment and he could be just as unmotivated there, if not moreso out of spite.  My thought was let him make his own choice, despite being clueless at 14, but to support him.  He and I have talked about how he will need to work harder, do activities, cut back on the gaming, he seems on board, but of course it's easy to support something that's five months away.  I'm also ignoring the possibility that there could still be remote classes in the fall which would destroy the first year hands-o part of the program, so I'm leaving that factor out of this discussion (plus I dont want a masks vs no-masks thread)

&amp;#x200B;

Just last week, when he was up at 3 am gaming, his parents shut off the wifi after asking him to go to bed multiple times. When I asked him about it, he said he was working on a assignment for his AP class in between gaming, and couldn't submit it due to some technical issues with the school site. He tried contacting his teachers, but never got a response before wifi was shut off. I guess there was other bouts of arguments before, and this was the tipping point for him. The next day he left the house to wonder around the neighborhood, with his parents going after him begging him to return home. A cop showed up, asking what was going on, and he told them he was thinking about suicide because of depression. This caused them to admit him to a hospital, where he stayed for 4 days. Nothing really came out of it, no helpful notes from the therapists besides depression, and he needs boundaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried having a talk with him yesterday. He doesn't think his parents understand the amount of schoolwork he has, and thinks he's only gaming because he's always in front of the computer. His parents never check on his work, and have told me that he's only playing games cause that's all they see. Last night SIL send a text at 12am of him playing games, even though he told them he has a big assignment due.

They have always pretty much had the same friend groups. I don't think any of them has one friend who isn't at least ""cool"" with the other twin. They do some separate things. Both are in orchestra but they play different instruments; viola vs cello. They do some different sports. They both do baseball and swimming but one does cross country running and the other does football. They do StuCo together, one as class president and one as school board rep, but one does Model UN and Debate while the other does Science Bowl and Robotics. They have some of the same classes together. We put them in different classes in elementary but once they got to junior high they started having classes together. This year was the most. They had 5 classes together. They are forced to spend a lot of time together but even when they aren't forced into it they usually end up hanging out anyway. It's rare that one leaves the house without the other one. So rare that I don't remember the last time it happened. They'll be seniors applying to college this fall and have talked about attending the same college vs attending different schools.

I don’t know exactly what triggered it. He was taking Prozac for his depression and seemed to be doing well. Working thirty hours a week during the shutdown. Got good grades. We never insisted that he take meds or work. School was his job. Since he got good grades while working we thought he was fine. 

Sometime in February he started smoking pot every day. Kids at school were asking him if he was okay because he was so lethargic. He decided to switch to smoking thc oil instead and occasionally took dxm, which is a cough syrup.
He told me on a Thursday all this and that he needed to quit work because the managers smoke pot with the crew and he needed to make positive changes in his life. My husband and I fully supported him. How could we not? 

He was unable to sleep and as the week progressed he because manic. Sometimes he made sense and other times he didn’t. His rants easily could have been posts on Twitter. “I saw this coming!! It’s a new beginning! Moving forward!!”  We convinced him to get an assessment and they told us an appointment to a psychiatrist would take a week but worst case, take him to the ER. We came home and that night and went to bed. My son decided to get the Neuralink. (That’s Elon Musk. His delusions ranged from Elon Musk, Andrew Yang and Hannibal Barca.) He took my car around 2am and drove to a college the next town over. He was walking around in a university parking deck looking for the Neuralink. Thankfully the university police recognized him being manic and called his dad. I’m certain if they just sent him on his way the outcome would have been so much worse. My husband took him to the hospital and that’s where he was involuntary committed  and sent to a mental hospital an hour away. 

I’m only sharing this to maybe help others. This is the beginning for us; who knows when or if he will get better. My uneducated opinion thinks he has a cannabis induced psychosis but who knows. Maybe schizophrenia, bipolar. Time will tell. 

Of course I feel like the worst parent ever.  My heart breaks for my son that he was suffering but didn’t come to us. I can’t imagine how he feels. I know he needs help and he is where he belongs but the mom side of me wants to break him out and just hold him. 

I spoke to him last night and I can’t remember exactly what I said but he responded by yelling “The future will heal us!” So, I’m holding on to that.

 Today, top ten results were released, and despite top scores and grades for her class, and ranking number 2 out of the whole district, the school ranked her #4. She is devastated.

They have weirdly gotten even closer through being separated so I am little unsure of how to handle everything. 

When she used to come over her parents made it clear that they did not want her in my son's bedroom. My son shares a room with his younger brother so he wasn't super intent on spending time with his girlfriend in there anyway. Instead they would spend time in the family room, in the basement, which is somewhat private but people walk in and out all the time, or in our yard. They don't really spend time at her house because they say her parents make sure they stay within eye sight at all times but now my son is asking for more privacy at the house. He is fine with the bedroom being off limits because he doesn't want to violate her parents trust but he has asked if they could have the backyard to themselves for an hour or so when she's over here. I told him that's fine with me as long as his siblings agree and he said he'll work on that. 

Now I am wondering if I violated the parenting code.

I don’t feel I should say anything to the girls parents but I told my son to tell her she should talk to her parents. I don’t know if this is the right decision but I’m curious how others have handled this. It’s unsettle especially because they’re so young. I was very young my first time and didn’t want this for either of them. They’re both good kids, great kids but those damn hormones...

So now, I have to figure out a man for them being able to see each other. I don’t want to punish them by not allowing them to see each other. Again, they’ll find a way.

Fortunately, her mother and I have a fairly good parenting relationship or this situation would be even more challenging to deal with.

It all started approximately one year ago, our daughter sneaked out of her mom's house and stole her car. She then proceeded to pick up several other teens for a late night joy ride that included drinking and drugs. The cops noticed the odd driving patterns of the vehicle and pulled them over. She was arrested and received a six month probation term. Up until this point we were very trusting of her but we were forced to do some investigating and it revealed that drugs, alcohol and unprotected sex had been ongoing for sometime. As a result we were forced to take very restrictive measures, seek out counseling for her and help ensure she completed her probation successfully.

Over the course of the last year she had completed all her requirements and had made great strides in earning our trust back. We moved forward with trusting her and giving her back those privileges that she had lost. Sadly, we recently noticed some inconsistencies in her behavior and decided to do some investigating. We found out that she's been engaging in similar destructive behavior once again (alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex, distributing nude photos, etc...). We are back to square one after an entire year of this process. I feel very gullible and deceived by all of this. It's also very disheartening that her biggest concern is her loss of access to phone, friends, etc... with no concern for the people she's hurt or her own health and well being. After reviewing the content on her phone I found that she seems to have this infatuation with the gangster lifestyle that is often depicted in rap/hip-hop culture and so she is trying to emulate that lifestyle.

I am unsure of how I should handle this situation going forward. I feel like I let her down and the past year of progress was just washed away. I love my daughter but I do not like the person that she currently is. I would love some feedback on possible approaches to this situation or some insight from parents who have navigated this before. Let me know if there are any other important details that I've left out and I'll be happy to edit my post.",True,False,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,2177620,public,self,"Struggling with how to handle toxic, self destructive behavior",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/go2b15/struggling_with_how_to_handle_toxic_self/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

This past March, my daughter turned 18 and applied for her passport. The day it arrived, she booked a flight to Texas USA to be with a boy she met online. All without us knowing. We are from Canada.


I woke up at about 4am that morning and seen a note on the kitchen table. We had no idea what time she left but we chased after her. When we got to the airport and finally figured out where to go we missed her by just a few minutes. She was already passed security check point but only about 20 yards away. We couldn't go through without a passport (in our hurry we didn't even think about bringing them) We screamed for her to stop but she just turned her back to us. Border officers interviewed us and my daughter and looked up the person that she was going to go see. We brought the letter she wrote, there was nothing in there showing that she was planning to stay (she had a return flight booked) so they let her go. There was absolutely nothing that we could do.


Thankfully she stayed in touch when she got there. 

We figured there was no way she would come back right away, so we waited until after the date of the return flight and we flew out there without telling her. We met the family. Thankfully everyone 'seemed' normal. Very religious but a normal family i guess. They were all very accepting of what the two kids were doing. Almost encouraging it. His entire family just gave examples of what they did when they were young. 

As you can guess, she would not come back with us. She rebooked her flight for a much later date.



Now we skip to today....

She sent us a picture of their marriage license and they are getting married tomorrow.

Her boyfriend is very manipulative. He uses religion when he wants to or ignores it when he doesn't. Now, she says weird things like ""see you in heaven"". No matter what we say, nothing works. She doesn't see anything wrong with what she is doing and that she is 'sorry' that she may only see us once a year if we visit.

She pushed everything away. Her friends and her family. Our other daughter is so crushed. In just a short time, she has broken our hearts deeply. She was an incredible person. We used to be so close. This is so crazy what she has done. We can't make sense of it. I am incredibly scared for her. None of this is right.

My wife was talking to her about the marriage thing and twice my daughter mentioned that it will help her get a green card. This was all in text messaging. 


Which brings me to my question...

1. Could her saying that in a text message and me giving it to the county clerk (before she gets married), make that marriage license void or something?

2. What about giving this to the US immigration? Would they have grounds to kick her out or deny her a green card?

3. What would you do?


I am very scared for her. She isn't the same person she used to be. His manipulation was extreme. She wasn't ""allowed"" to do so many things. When i talk to her friends they too are scared for her and do not trust this guy. There was so much that i didn't see. I guess i took it for granted when she was talking to this kid. She has talked to him for over a year but it was only about 3 months before she left that we noticed changes. We were thinking it was just being a teenager. We were so wrong. Our home is good. We have another daughter that is a few years younger. We have always been a close and what i thought, a good strong family.

I have been consulting a few of the school teenagers lately as a part of an assignment and I can say that the [teenage years](https://community.today.com/parentingteam/post/6-obvious-reasons-why-being-a-teenager-is-hard-today) are challenging, wonderful, and scary at the same time. I have many friends who are parents to teenagers, a few of them being teenage boys. We many-a-times get into a discussion about parenting the teenage boys and the situations are different from all of my friends and their sons.     

Teenage is the time when these boys are learning to be men. To put it another way, this is a major step in life because of the [changes in personality, emotions, and physical appearance](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/understanding-puberty.html). These are the years that really matter – to the boys and to the parents as well. Though your sons act and feel like they need you lesser and lesser, in actuality, they need you more than ever. There is plenty of research that shows that parents need to spend more time with their kids when they are in their teenage years. However, you can ask me how is that even possible when they are restricting your presence in their lives.

First of all, you need to find something that your son enjoys doing, and second, do it with him: Bowling, Movie Marathon, Go Camping, Play video games he likes, throw balls around. You have to make sure that you are with your son, spending quality time and not constantly scolding him for doing certain things and not doing others. 

## Teenage Years are Important Parenting Years

You can make the most of these years by connecting with your teenagers. Moreover, this is the time when you can positively affect their ‘[teen behavior](https://www.georgetownbehavioral.com/blog/7-differences-between-normal-abnormal-teenage-behavior)’. They are not going to be in their teens for much longer. So for that reason, use this time to raise them to be the men that you want them to be as an adult. They would learn from you how to behave in ‘their’ ‘real-life’. In fact, you will forever cherish the moments you spend with them during their teens.

## Parenting Teenage Boys Means: 

### 1. You have to Listen

Your teenage son starts to explain his perspective and you immediately find the problems with his reasoning. As part of your parenting, you have an overwhelming temptation to give advice—even though you know that the conversation will end in frustration and disappointment. You have to ignore the impulse to tell them what to do and just listen to them. Your job from now on is to shut up and listen. Michelle Lehnardt from Today.com says – when you take the time to listen, truly listen, your kids will ask your opinion and NOW you offer your wisdom. 

### 2. Your parenting has to teach’em – IT’S NOT ALL ABOUT THEM!

It is about me, my plans, my thoughts! – That’s a teenage boy’s world. 

Fitting in – is now not only important – it is everything to them. This transition is also often filled with rebellious behavior and differing opinions, which can be frustrating for you. 

They begin to expect and even demand more than your love. They desire instant gratification and have the demand to receive something just because they want it. You often fulfill their demands and give your kids more, thinking it will make them feel better, but it actually places a higher value on things than on relationships. 

We all need to grow up and realize. We are the ones with the ability to make sense of all of the madness and chaos that they are producing. Teach them that ‘they’ are not the center of the universe. This lesson is hard but important.

### 3. Delay Their Gratification

Let’s be honest: Teenagers sometimes suck at being patient. Parenting them is teaching them to be patient. For starters, help your child work toward his goal with a step by step plan. If your teenager is working on a big project with the promise of a nice dinner at a restaurant, help him map out a plan to get to the finish line. You could develop a calendar for your child to review or establish goals that are written down and can be reviewed. Offer encouragement as your teen progresses through the project and motivate as he gets closer and closer to the goal. 

Be sure that you carry through on any promise that you make to him. If you promised your child that you would go to the movies after he or she brings up a math grade, be sure you make good on your promise once your child has accomplished the goal. 

In the end, your child will eventually learn that the choices we all make come with consequences. Delaying gratification can help your teen set his or her sites on bigger goals, and work towards achieving them.

 

### 4. Parenting Teenagers also means Getting Down and Dirty

You will embarrass them. You yourself will feel embarrassed. Even if they try and cut the topic, you do not have to. You have to keep working hard and continue to keep the [lines of communication open](https://parentinghighschoolers.com/communicating-with-teenagers/) about the ‘irregular talks’. Talk to them about drugs, alcohol, tobacco, STD’s, and sex. Talk about pregnancy and child support and what are the consequences of premature and unprotected sex. 

The fact is that there is very little discussion on these topics in the family amongst teenagers and parents, though there are reports that teens are getting exposed to all these ‘stuff’ at younger and younger ages.  

### 5.  Teach Empathy through your Parenting

Often, people bully or unintentionally hurt others because they lack the ability to think about and understand the impact of their actions and words on others. Without empathy and respect for others, it’s easy to act in ways that hurt other people. There are many ways your teenager can get what they need without having a negative impact on others, and your parenting needs to teach them these skills. 

They do not have to experience any pain to understand this. Rather, they have to just acknowledge it and let others know that they are there for them.

“Discuss current events with your children and ask them how they think the people in the story might be feeling. It can also help to discuss situations that your teenager might see on TV shows with fictional characters. Ask them if they relate to a particular person in the show and why. Then, ask them what other characters might be thinking and feeling.

Modeling is very important. For example, tell them a story about a time when you might have suspected a friend was in trouble, what you were thinking about at the time, and what you did to help.

### 6. They Can’t Force Someone to Like Them

We know and they too have to know that Rejection is a part of life. Not everyone will like them. You tell your teen that to you, he is wonderful and unique and special. No matter how hard they try, there will still be people who will not like them. They can’t change it. Your parenting needs to teach them that they can’t do anything about it, except to [be kind and move on](https://raisingteenstoday.com/ways-to-help-your-teen-believe-in-themselves/).

This is a life fact that has to be learnt as early as possibly by your teenage kids. 

### 7. Don’t Expect Instant Compliance

This is a very simple thing but subconsciously you might be forcing it on your teenagers. You want them to fold clothes, keep things in place, set utensils on the dinner table, etc. Never expect your kids to stop what they are doing and instantly do the [activities that you ask them to do](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/25-of-the-best-household-chores-for-kids-of-every-age-53410). Respect the fact that they might need a minute to finish what they are doing before they can move onto your tasks. Just tell them not to ignore you and respond by acknowledging that they need 5 minutes to do it.  

Just like we would not be expected to jump up as soon as our spouse or child called us, they should be given enough respect to finish what they are doing before moving onto your task.

### 8.  Important Lesson in Parenting Teenagers – NO MEANS NO.

Have you fallen into the habit of over-explaining and over-negotiating with your kids? With teenage boys in the house, the answer would certainly be a ‘yes’. 

If so, it’s likely that every time your teenager wants to challenge your authority, decision, or rule, you keep talking to him in order to get him to understand why you’ve made the rule in the first place. And often, you find yourself compromising and changing the rules. Understand that what you’re really doing is training your child not to accept your decisions.  

The situations are really complex when you have to listen to their opinions and at the same time teach them to understand consent. But, that’s teenage parenting!

I believe the best thing you can do when your child is arguing with your rules or consequence is to say:

“No, I’m not going to discuss this any further.”

And turn around and walk away. Don’t respond to any backtalk. So if you say no and your child starts saying, “But, but, but…” just keep walking. 

When things are cool, show them another aspect of this by telling them “When someone tells you no (your boyfriend or girlfriend), they mean they do not want whatever it is you are offering. Teach them to think before they react. 

Along with that, also teach him that he too has the [power to say NO](https://worldofmother.com/keep-your-child-safe-from-sexual-abuse/), and the right to follow his instinct when he feels like it is not the right decision.

### 9. Parenting to make them responsible 

Teach them to take responsibility for the wins and for the losses – Not to blame someone else. Role modeling is the most effective tool to teach this and anything else for that matter. Any value you want your teen to have, simply demonstrate it in your everyday life. So if you want your teens to take responsibility for their actions, you should do the same. 

Avoid blaming others. Follow rules, and don’t avoid the consequences if you break them. If you make a mistake, admit it, apologize, and make amends if possible. For example, if you accidentally bang the door of the car next to you in the parking lot, then leave a note!

Let them know and understand – “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.” \~ Charles R. Swindoll. 

### 10. Parenting actively and appropriately

Don’t invite rebellion by refusing to acknowledge that your son is growing up and [needs more freedom](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-to-allow-teen-independence-and-still-keep-them-close-4165998). But don’t be afraid to ask where your kids are going, who they’ll be with, and what they’ll be doing.

My (F18) sister (F14) is straining away from us, she has become increasingly depressed and I don't know what to do. 

Now I understand why she wouldn't want to talk to my dad as it would do more harm then good (borderline abusive, lots of yelling and emotional abuse, he's not a ~bad guy~, just not fit to be a parent). He'd just start yelling at her if she opened up to him and make her feel worse.
My mom is better but my sister doesn't want to open up to her either, I felt the same when I was her age, my mom really tries to understand though, I just personnaly feel like she wouldn't really get it if we opened up to her. 
But now she won't even talk to us her siblings which really came off as a shock to me.
We did talk about 2 weeks ago, she confided in me she was depressed and was feeling worthless and that she was considering to end her life. I also found out she cut her wrists and saw she was looking for ways to kill herself with paracetamol.
She feels lots of pressure from school, she feels so overwhelmed and exceeded, she tells me she's lost and doesn't understand anything, her teachers make her feel worthless and never show any appreciation towards her (which doesn't surprise me, we went to the same school and I was handed the same treatement).
She also came out to me as non binary, which must be so hard to navigate right now as her body is changing, she hates that her boobs are growing and just wants to present as a boy. The pressure of hiding it from our parents, and facing remarks from other children at school must be unbearable. I think she only told me because I am a lesbian myself but haven't come out to our parents either.
She told me all this and she was crying and could barely speak and my heart was so broke I just want to know how I can help her.

This week she's been locking herself in her room mainly because she doesn't like being bothered during online classes, but she won't even come out when she's done at 4pm and only comes out for dinner at 7.30pm, she runs back to her rooms as soon as that's over. She didn't even come out during the weekend.
I tried to spend some time with her today after dinner but she was acting super cold and she didn't want to let me in, I asked ""don't you like when we just hang out and talk"" and she just said ""no"", so I said ""okay"" and left.
I just feel super lost, she used to open up to me before, and we would spend time together but now she won't even look at me. I think I am the most suited to understand what she goes through, as I was teen just yersterday, heck I am still a teen. I just want to know how I can help her.
